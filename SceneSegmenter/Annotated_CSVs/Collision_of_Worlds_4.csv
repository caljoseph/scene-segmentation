“The Arkhon’s Gift” 
Sammy"
1,Sammy’s head throbbed with a painful and nauseating pulse.
0,She had little experience with hangovers.
0,"Once in the past, a former boyfriend shared with her his home-brewed mead."
0,"He brewed it using baker’s yeast instead of brewer’s yeast which, according to him, made gauging the alcohol content difficult, and from time to time the resulting brew was rather potent."
0,"This particular batch was much stronger than normal, and despite knowing this and that Sammy had never tried alcohol before--she was only 18 at the time--he let her drink multiple glasses without revealing this important little detail."
0,"She had no memory of what transpired afterwards, but the next morning she awoke naked on his couch with an aching hip and feeling like he had beaten her head in with a baseball bat."
0,"The pain wracking her head now was not a hangover, or at least she was sure it wasn’t because she had no memory of drinking, but the ache was not dissimilar and made all the more miserable by reminding her of that horrendous mistake of a boyfriend."
0,"Like that terrible evening over two years ago, Sammy couldn’t remember well why she had her current headache."
0,Her most recent memories were of crying in some trench in the forest.
0,"The Sprite Arkhon appeared, she argued with him, and then she blacked out, but she had difficulty remembering why they argued."
0,She tried piecing together the fragmented scenes in her mind.
0,He wanted to reward her for completing her challenge to find help for Justin.
0,She refused because Justin was taken away by the Tolmyur soldiers.
0,She couldn’t save him.
0,"That much she remembered clearly, and it made her heart ache."
0,But the Arkhon still saw fit to reward her.
0,Why?
0,"In her memories clouded by the incessant pain, she recalled that it was because she did something the Arkhon did not expect."
0,"No, it wasn’t something she did."
0,It was something that would happen because of something she did.
1,Sammy opened her weary eyes and sat up abruptly.
0,“Kree!” Coby startled and flapped his wings lightly.
0,Sammy quickly grabbed his beak to prevent him from making that earsplitting noise again.
0,"“I’m fine,” Sammy said, releasing Coby’s beak and lightly scratching the feathers on the side of his head."
0,“Just… don’t do that again.
0,My head hurts.” She now felt even sorrier for Justin who had to endure such pain every few months for the majority of his life.
0,"She often brushed his headaches off lightly because Justin always tried to act like they were mild, but if they were as severe as hers was now, or even worse, she realized how ignorantly callous she had been to him regarding his condition for the entire year they were dating."
0,"Then again, she had her own monthly pains to deal with that Justin could never experience, but if she had to choose between regular cramps or headaches, she’d pass on the headaches."
0,"She was used to her periods, and fortunately, they were never all that severe."
0,"“Where’s Ceil,” Sammy mumbled."
0,Coby gave a silent trill and clapped his beak lightly to not aggravate Sammy’s headache.
0,“She’s not here?” Sammy moaned as if those words were not hers.
0,She looked around at the unfamiliar hut.
0,Faint specks of light shimmered through the walls and thatch ceiling.
0,The walls of the hut grew like saplings from the ground with their branches weaving them together.
0,"The weave was tight but not perfect, so Sammy could see the shadows of people walking about outside."
0,"This was the same type of hut she had seen in the central Melian village, so her most reasonable guess was that she hadn’t left."
0,"At least Chloe and Ceil didn’t carry me off again when I was out, Sammy thought, remembering the acute pain in her shoulders after hanging by her arms for hours in a world with such strong gravity."
0,The thundering of Sammy’s head continued.
0,"If what she felt now was anything similar to a hangover, perhaps eating something would help."
0,The thought of food made her empty stomach cramp.
0,She had not felt this hungry since the day before Ceil found her atop the plateaus of Fiorrae.
0,Coby heard the growl of her stomach and hopped over to a bark platter beside her bed.
0,On it sat a variety of dried meat and herbs with what looked like small white berries that had a teardrop shape.
0,She was surprised that Coby had not eaten all the meat while she slept.
0,"Then again, she did not doubt that he had helped himself to some of it."
0,"After all, she had no way of knowing how much had originally been provided on the platter."
0,Sammy tossed one of the white berries into her mouth and immediately spat it out after biting into it.
0,It was sweet beyond sweet and increased the aching of her head particularly around her temples.
0,"Her body shivered from the sheer amount of sugar in the fruit, almost as if the very essence of sweetness had been refined to its purest form."
0,"She immediately grabbed one of the more bitter herbs, one she recognized from scavenging with Ceil, and chewed on it to rid her mouth of the pungent sweetness."
0,She then grabbed a strip of the meat to balance out the ruthless assault on her tastebuds.
0,"The moment she brought it to her mouth, Coby hopped about with a longing in his eyes, begging for handouts."
0,Perhaps he didn’t touch any of it.
0,"If Coby had been waiting patiently for Sammy to wake in order to ask her for some of her meal, she felt bad denying him."
0,"Of course, she also realized that he could be putting on an act and just wanted more, but she had no way of knowing for sure."
0,"He was staying by her bedside for whatever reason and expressed concern when she woke, so she could at least give him at little."
0,"While she held out a strip of dried meat for Coby, she caught hold upon a peculiar part of her reasoning."
0,Coby expressed concern?
0,Did he really?
0,Her question did not come from a doubt that Coby would be concerned about her.
0,"He had expressed concern through his actions when she was so exhausted that she was on the verge of collapse and eventually did collapse, but this was different."
0,"His high pitched cry was not unlike the many she heard before, but within it she felt a genuine concern about her health, almost as if that concern was spoken in words."
0,She handed another strip to Coby before taking a second strip for herself.
0,Her head ached too much to think deeply about what was likely something she imagined up in her exhaustion.
0,"She wanted so desperately to lie back down on her lush moss bed and sleep off the headache, but she had to warn the hamadryad."
0,"If what the Arkhon predicted was correct, the dryads were going to join the war, split on opposing sides."
0,"The sooner she could prevent any war preparations, the better."
0,Sammy gazed around the hut.
0,There was no exit.
0,The tight weave of saplings surrounded her on all sides almost as if this was a prison.
0,Or perhaps it was a prison.
0,"After all, they did attack the village, and during the negotiations between Ceil and the soldiers, most of the dryads stood on the Tolmyur commander’s side."
0,Sammy could not shake the worry creeping up her spine.
0,"She stood and nearly fell from her weak legs, but a rush of wind from Coby kept her upright."
0,She walked slowly to one of the small gaps in the wall while holding the side of her head in an attempt to suppress the ache.
0,"Her clothes stuck to her uncomfortably due to how much she had sweat while sleeping, but she could wash later."
0,"The gap provided little visibility of the outside village, but at least it was a dryad village, both adding to her confidence that they had not left the village and adding to her worry that something might have happened to Chloe, Ceil, and Lemi."
0,"Their provisions were not in the hut, so this hut or prison was meant solely for her and Coby."
0,"Coby could escape whenever he wanted with his wind magic, but instead he stayed by Sammy’s side."
0,She tore the piece of meat protruding from her mouth in two and passed the larger part to Coby.
0,Sammy moved along the wall to another larger gap.
0,"From there she could see the back of the large tree in the center of the village, now looking more like a cedar than whatever that stout tree had been before, confirming her location."
0,The roots of the Hamadryad circled the trunk of the tree from the front and snaked their way through the nearby huts.
0,The few dryads she could see took extra caution to avoid stepping on any of the roots.
0,The huts the roots touched looked dried and dead and were in various states of deconstruction and removal.
0,"Sammy felt terrible that because of her demand that the hamadryad root here, so many lost their homes."
0,"If anything, she deserved to be in prison."
0,"If she convinced someone to destroy a bunch of houses on Earth, she would be culpable if not just as guilty as the one who destroyed them."
0,"Near the tree, a young dryad appeared who did not mind stepping on and climbing over the roots."
0,"She was an Anthousai, her hair covered in so many tiny white flowers that it glistened like powder snow in the sunlight."
0,Sammy wanted to call out to Lemi but hesitated.
0,Lemi was not imprisoned.
0,"Either some deal had been made or they forgave the girl, being only a child."
0,"Still, she was Sammy’s only hope for an explanation about what happened after she blacked out."
0,“Lemi!”
0,The young dryad turned her head towards Sammy so fast that Sammy could almost feel the pain in her neck that such a quick jolt would cause.
0,Lemi then ran off.
0,Sammy half expected the reaction.
0,"If Sammy was a criminal, avoiding her was the best choice."
0,She walked back to the center of the hut and sat down on her moss bed.
0,"It was damp like her clothes from her sweat, now cold and uncomfortable to lie on."
0,"Sleep would not be possible much to her dismay, so she decided to finish her herbs, avoiding the white berries."
0,"While eating, Sammy noticed the hut growing darker."
0,"She assumed a cloud was passing over, but light still filtered through the sparse holes in the thatch roof."
0,Only the light from the walls was blocked.
0,The passing shadows stopped moving and continually grew in number.
0,Sammy could hear them whispering among themselves.
0,“She’s awake.”
0,“What are you doing?
0,We are supposed to leave her be.”
0,"“Mom, I want to see her.” "
0,Sammy felt like a caged animal in a zoo.
0,Coby noticed her discontent and trotted up to the shadows.
0,He flapped his wings with an annoyed trill.
0,"The hut shook lightly in the strong wind, and the dryads on the other side of that wall yelped in surprise."
0,They kept their distance after that.
0,"Again, Sammy noticed the meaning of Coby’s trill."
0,"Unlike spoken words, she only caught the succinct emotion or intent conveyed by the call, but she understood it perfectly."
0,The whispers too.
0,"The dryads were not speaking English, but she understood what they said."
0,"Sammy had little experience in foreign languages, only learning French in school, and she was never fluent."
0,"She had to think hard about the meaning of any French she heard, but her instructor always told her that when learning languages, there is a point when the language “clicks,” when you no longer needed to process it in your mind because you naturally understand the meaning."
0,That level of competency was the strange sensation Sammy felt.
0,She recalled the negotiations between Ceil and the officer of the enemy soldiers.
0,"“If you can promise me that you will return my companion in full health, I accept."
0,I will meet you in battle in Vallen.”
0,She understood the agreement.
0,"She hadn’t then, but she did now as clearly as if they were speaking English, and it terrified her."
1,“Clear the way!”
0,Relief washed over Sammy when she heard Ceil’s voice.
0,"The shadows parted, and the sapling wall split open to allow Ceil and Lemi through."
0,Ceil closed the wall behind her so that no one else could enter.
0,“What’s going on?
0,What happened after I passed out?
0,Am I a prisoner?” 
0,"Sammy rattled off the questions weighing on her mind, but her quick and breathless speech caused her head to ache worse."
0,She held her head and sat back down on her damp bed.
0,Ceil looked around at the doorless walls with an understanding grimace.
0,“I can see why you would think you are prisoner.
0,Sorry to worry you.
0,The truth is the opposite.
0,There is no entryway to remind the villagers to leave you alone.
0,The Sprite Arkhon ordered me to prevent any dryads from touching you while you slept.
0,"It was easy at first, but…” Ceil gave an exasperated sigh, “…things grew complicated.”"
0,“What do you mean?” 
0,“Part of this is my fault.
0,Remember when I apologized to you after the soldiers left?
0,I bowed myself in front of you.
0,I was not thinking about how that would look to the entire village watching us.
0,"That was a sign to them that you are of higher standing than I, the Empress of the Amelian Empire."
0,"The next day, the hamadryad let slip that you obtained the Sprite Arkhon’s favor and were the one who ordered her to take root in this village."
0,That was also a sign to everyone that you are of higher standing than even their hamadryad.”
0,"Sammy was speechless, and for a moment, she forgot about her headache."
0,“I think that was a calculated move by the hamadryad after she felt the reaction the Melians had to my mistake.
0,"Most the village was opposed to the hamadryad, but now that they think that you, with more authority than any of us, ordered her to root here in the village, they became more understanding, and the village is slowly starting to unify under her.”"
0,"“And now I am a celebrity,” Sammy whispered under her breath, her voice weary with a new kind of exhaustion."
0,“What did the Sprite Arkhon do to you that was so important he forbade anyone with life magic from touching you?” Ceil asked.
0,Sammy scanned the walls of the hut.
0,She could still hear and understand the whispers and curious conversations of the villagers.
0,“The Arkhon’s gift…” Sammy faced Lemi.
0,“Can you say something in Melian?”
0,Lemi’s eyes grew wide and her smile wider.
0,She dropped to her knees and grabbed Sammy’s hands in excitement.
0,“You speak Melian?
0,Since when?!”
0,"“Am I really speaking Melian,” Sammy asked Ceil."
0,"“You are speaking Fiorran now, or I guess it is the language of your world, but when you talked to Lemi, you spoke Melian."
0,I could not understand you.”
0,I really did speak Melian?
0,"Sammy tried to recall the words she spoke when addressing Lemi, and the memory that came was not in English."
0,"It was another language, but like listening to the babble outside the hut, she understood the meaning of her words without needing to parse them."
0,"Somehow, she spoke a language she had never learned as if it was only natural for her to do so."
0,The revelation was terrifying but exciting all the same.
0,The Arkhon had asked her what she regretted most.
0,"Aside from Justin’s health and capture, her greatest regret since arriving in Melia was her inability to understand anyone but Ceil and Chloe."
0,She could only sit and wait while Ceil spoke with the hamadryad and then needed Ceil to translate for her when the hamadryad wanted to hear from her.
0,"Again, she could only stand and wait during the negotiation between the soldiers and Ceil."
0,"If this was the Arkhon’s gift, it was too good to be true."
0,"Something like this should be impossible, but how else could she explain her newfound language skills?"
0,Sammy thought about the sparse Elven that Eydis taught her.
0,"“Ceil, what language am I speaking now?”"
0,"“That is Elven, specifically the High Elf dialect of the capital,” Ceil replied in a state of shock."
0,“It is a little different from the Filinceil dialect of my childhood home.
0,Is this what the Sprite Arkhon did to you?
0,Why?”
0,Sammy felt uneasy about explaining her bet with the Arkhon.
0,She still felt that she had not accomplished anything and only made the situation worse.
0,“That’s right!” 
0,"Sammy’s outburst caused her head to pound, and she reeled from the pain."
0,“Are you hurt?
0,Should I heal you?” Lemi gripped Sammy’s hand with genuine concern.
0,Sammy shook her head.
0,“I’m fine.
0,I need to speak to the hamadryad.
0,It’s urgent.”
0,Lemi’s face lit up from again hearing Sammy speak Melian.
0,“Of course!
0,I will take you immediately.”
0,She pulled Sammy to her feet and led her to the wall of the hut facing the center of the village.
0,“Where are you going?” Ceil asked.
0,"Sammy realized that because she spoke to Lemi, she spoke Melian, a language Ceil did not know."
0,Language barriers were troublesome.
0,"Even with the Arkhon’s gift, she could only speak one language at a time."
0,The words she spoke were not universal.
0,“I need to see the hamadryad.
0,"The Arkhon gave me a warning about the war,” Sammy explained."
1,Ceil understood the urgency and followed Sammy and Lemi out the opening Lemi made in the wall.
0,Immediately Sammy was accosted by the villagers greeting her and trying to present her with gifts of herbs and wreaths of winter flowers.
0,"“Sorry, but I don’t have time."
0,This is urgent.
0,"Please move,” Sammy ordered."
0,The villagers reluctantly cleared a path.
0,"Lemi continued pulling Sammy along, each step causing Sammy’s head to throb."
0,“What about Chloe?
0,Is she alright?” 
0,"In Sammy’s most recent memories, Chloe was near death from fighting against the Tolmyur soldiers."
0,"She had not arrived at the hut with Lemi and Ceil, so she was worried."
0,"“Chloe is fine,” Ceil replied."
0,“She is resting in Jenae’s care.
0,We’ll take you to her after you speak with the hamadryad.” 
0,Sammy exhaled her relief.
1,"Her legs were still weak, so Ceil and Lemi helped her over the thick roots surrounding the stout tree in the center of the village."
0,They led her inside the hollow that was once the abode of the village matriarch.
0,There Sammy saw for the first time a true hamadryad.
0,The formerly terrifying woman with dark sunken eyes and cracks of orange covering her bark-like grey skin had grown to become a beautiful woman in her prime.
0,"Her skin remained its dark, grey-brown hue, but a hint of orange gave it color."
0,Her arms were fused with the trunk of the cedar above her head as was her back and a single leg below her.
0,The leg that was missing below the knee in Sammy’s memory was in the process of regrowth and was only just beginning to fuse with the trunk.
0,"“I am honored by your visit, child."
0,What need have you of me?” 
0,"The Hamadryad’s voice was soft and melodious, far different from the course, grating noise Sammy remembered, but the formal manner of speech made her uncomfortable."
0,"She assumed that the hamadryad was only supporting the lie the villagers ignorantly fabricated, treating Sammy as if she was higher in status."
0,"Sammy was about to speak, but then stopped."
0,"If she spoke without thinking, she might speak in Melian or whatever language this cedar dryad used in her homeland."
0,"Thinking on the Elven taught her by Eydis, she spoke her worries."
0,“The Arkhon warned me that the dryads will be pulled into the war on both sides because I convinced you to plant yourself here.”
0,The hamadryad’s peaceful expression grew stern.
0,"Before she could speak, Ceil grabbed Sammy’s shoulder and turned her to face her."
0,“Is this true?
0,Did the Sprite Arkhon truly say that?” Ceil asked.
0,"“Yes.” Sammy wanted to deny it, but because she was at fault, informing everyone was her responsibility."
0,"“Then, what was the reason for my agreement with the Tolmyur commander?"
0,"We were to fight in Vallen, in an existing battle, to spare the dryads."
0,I do not want more people to die.”
0,"Sammy’s heart sank, and her guilt made her nauseous, more so than her headache."
0,Ceil paced a tight circle between the roots in thought.
0,“We already know that the dryads are now split because less than half of them recognize the hamadryad… 
0,"Of those under your influence, what are their opinions on the war?” she asked the hamadryad."
0,The hamadryad grew as still as a wood carving.
1,"While waiting for an answer, Sammy sat into the bend of one of the thicker roots and leaned back to rest her throbbing head."
0,"“Want me to check what’s wrong,” Lemi asked with her hands clasped in front of her chest."
0,"“Yah, please,” Sammy replied."
0,Lemi knelt down and placed her hand on Sammy’s forehead.
0,A warm pulse ran through her body.
0,“Your nerves are strained.
0,Muscles in your head are inflamed and contracting.”
0,“I know that.
0,"That’s what a headache is,” Sammy said, letting her frustration slip."
0,“Did you find a reason?” 
0,"Lemi shrunk back, so Sammy took a long and slow breath and grabbed Lemi’s arm gently."
0,“Sorry.
0,I didn’t mean to sound angry.
0,"If you don’t know, that’s fine."
0,It will probably pass with time.”
0,Lemi shook her head.
0,"“I don’t know if it’s the cause, but your mind is very active."
0,"I don’t know mind magic, so I cannot say more than that.”"
0,“Let me see.” 
0,Ceil placed her hand on Sammy’s forehead.
0,A sensation followed that Sammy had never felt before.
0,It was as if Ceil reached inside her and stopped before touching the very core of what Sammy was.
0,Her hand hovered there as Ceil’s face grew more and more worried.
0,Then she touched.
0,Sammy’s hearing and vision distorted as if submerged under agitated water.
0,Her body grew numb but the ache in her head grew to a skull-splitting pain.
0,"She cried out, or at least she felt as if she did because her ears could not hear it."
0,The distorted shapes of Ceil and Lemi panicked.
0,They each grabbed one of Sammy’s arms and placed her hands on the large roots.
0,"A flow of warmth ran from Sammy’s right hand, through her body and mind, and out her left hand."
0,The aching of her head ebbed to a dull throb no less intense than it had been when she woke but was made far more tolerable after the sudden acute pain.
0,Her vision cleared and her hearing returned.
0,"She could hear sobbing, and only once feeling returned to her body did she realize the one sobbing was her."
0,The taste of iron filled her mouth from the blood that ran down her lip from her nose.
0,“Sammy!
0,Are you alright?!”
0,Ceil asked in panic.
0,“I am sorry.
0,I only touched your mind like I did before. I…”
0,“Child.” 
0,The Hamadryad’s voice silenced Ceil.
0,"Unlike the melodious tone of her earlier greeting, her voice now held the authority of one who rules the dryads."
0,“Who did this to you?”
0,Sammy could only mouth a single word reply.
0,“…Arkhon…?” 
0,"She was unsure, but her strange headache happened after her argument with the Arkhon and the unknown space of time she was unconscious."
0,"If it was a tension headache from stress or from sleeping in bad posture, Sammy expected Lemi would have said so and probably could have alleviated it."
0,“I assumed as much.
0,This level of life magic is beyond what I am capable.
0,"There is one dryad, an ancient kissiae, who could potentially manipulate the mind to this extent, but this magic may even be beyond her."
0,"I feel I know the answer, but what was it that the Sprite Arkhon did to you?”"
0,Sammy swallowed the blood that pooled in her mouth.
0,"The bleeding from her nose ceased, so she wiped her lip with the side of her hand."
0,"“Language,” she replied after a few deep breaths."
0,“Speak and understand… languages.”
0,"“Far more benign that I thought,” the hamadryad replied with a hint of relief."
0,“I assume your pain is caused by your mind being unaccustomed to the mental strain of the level of knowledge you now possess.
0,Your mind is agitated and unstable.
0,"Until you grow accustomed to your new abilities, I would refrain from allowing others of weak life magic from interfering with your mind.”"
0,Ceil bowed her head apologetically.
0,"“Sorry. The Sprite Arkhon warned me not to let anyone with weak life magic touch you, and I went and did it anyway.”"
0,"“No, I am the one who asked you and Lemi to find what was wrong.” "
0,Sammy returned her attention to the hamadryad.
0,"“More importantly, about Ceil’s question."
0,What do the dryads think of the war?”
0,“I cannot speak for those I do not influence.
0,Those outside of Melia who have accepted me as their Grandmatriarch hold a neutral opinion of the war.
0,"If I push for or against their involvement, their stance will shift as well."
0,Melia is more troubled.
0,There are two opposing waves spreading throughout the villages.
0,One wave of messengers preaches continued submission to the stronger forces of Tolmyur and a warning to be wary of the widow of Emperor Yuro.
0,"If ordered by the enemy, I feel they will join with Tolmyur."
0,The second wave preaches support for the surviving member of the royal family who has entered their lands raising a rally cry to take back their empire from the Tolmyur invasion.
0,They may join the war against Tolmyur with or without my direction.
0,Fear and hope are equally potent motivators.”
0,"“I did no such thing,” Ceil protested in pure exasperation."
0,“Where did these rumors start? Here?”
0,"“I cannot say, but the origins are not from this village,” The hamadryad replied."
0,Ceil looked at Lemi who immediately grew nervous.
0,“Your village… All the dryads that were missing when we returned.
0,You sent the messengers.”
0,“We didn’t know where you would go when you left or that you’d return to our village.
0,We didn’t want other villages to betray you like you thought ours did.
0,We only said that you are fighting for us.
0,The message must have changed as it traveled.”
0,“You only made things worse!” 
0,"Lemi cowered behind Sammy, and Sammy winced from the throbbing caused by Ceil’s shout."
0,"“Lemi didn’t do anything, and shouting at her is not going to stop this,” Sammy rebuked before returning to the main topic."
0,“How many of those who believe that message are under your influence?
0,How many accept you as their Grandmatriarch?”
0,"“The majority, but not all,” the hamadryad replied."
0,Ceil pleaded with the hamadryad with her hands on the hamadryad’s knees.
0,"“No matter what happens, you must not join the war."
0,Use your influence to stop the dryads or hold them back.”
0,“A hamadryad’s influence is far from absolute.
0,I cannot rob them of their free will.”
0,“Promise me!” 
0,Ceil bowed as low as she could with her hands clasped on the Hamadryad’s knees.
0,“I do not want them to die because of me.”
0,“I will do what I can.” 
0,"“That’s all we can ask,” Sammy replied with her hand on Ceil’s shoulder."
0,“Thank you.”
0,"Chapter 2
“Preparations for Departure”
Sammy"
1,"“I suppose I’m going to have to face the crowd now,” Sammy moaned."
0,"“Sorry,” Ceil answered with a light grimace."
0,Chloe’s hut sat next to Sammy’s “prison.” 
0,"Before they left the hollow, Lemi warned them that the crowd had not dispersed."
0,"The villagers were forbidden from interacting with Sammy while she slept, but now that she was awake, there was little reason to stop them."
0,"Of course, the villagers realized this as well."
0,They waited with gifts and questions about Sammy’s origins and how she obtained such authority that even their Grandmatriarch and Empress bent to her will.
0,Sammy was at least grateful that they had the self-restraint to not interrupt her meeting with the Hamadryad.
0,"Then again, interrupting an urgent meeting between what they believed to be the three of the highest authorities in all the dryad forests of Dhuillir, possibly all the Amelian Empire, would be the height of impudence."
0,"Before Sammy could even see Chloe’s hut, she had two wreaths and four necklaces placed around her neck."
0,"Ceil tried to direct the crowd so they could at least make some progress, and Lemi’s job was to collect other gifts which were quickly piling up too high for her to hold, but there was one gift that Lemi did not reach for."
0,"A teal-skinned Dryad with heart-shaped, erose leaves for hair knelt before Sammy and presented four of the same white berries that were provided with Sammy’s meal."
0,The presentation of gifts ceased as all waited for Sammy to receive the offering.
0,"“What are those berries,” Sammy asked Ceil, worried that she might do something offensive."
0,"“She is an epimeliad, an extremely rare form of dryad,” Ceil replied."
0,“They are about as rare as my two tails.
0,They are not a special species of their own.
0,"Any dryad can mother one, and from her appearance, she is not from Melia.”"
0,"“Instead of bearing children, they bear fruit,” Lemi added, struggling under the awkward load of gifts."
0,"“They often travel, planting their fruit to diversify the forests."
0,To be given their fruit is the same as a mother giving you her daughter.”
0,"“I can’t accept it,” Sammy whispered in English to Ceil, trying to hide her panic from the dryads watching in anticipation."
0,“I’m not special enough to deserve this.” 
0,She remembered the pungently sweet berry she spat out.
0,"If this Epimeliad knew she spat it out, how grave of an insult would that be?"
0,"“Take them,” Lemi suggested after she, too, grew nervous from Sammy’s inaction."
0,“Only the one given the fruit can receive it.
0,"If you do not want to eat them, plant them.”"
0,"“It is as the anthousai says,” the epimeliad said with her face bowed and her cupped hands extended."
0,"“I am aware that you may not understand our customs, but please accept my offering.”"
0,"Sammy extended her shaking hand and received the four berries, taking extra caution not to crush them."
0,“Feel free to continue using my hut as a sanctuary from the crowds until you and your companions are ready to depart for Vallen.”
0,“Thank you.
0,"I will treasure them,” Sammy answered, realizing immediately afterwards that her words were another new language similar in structure to Melian yet sounding very different."
0,"The epimeliad stood, and even though her face was that of a healthy middle-aged woman, her smile was reminiscent of a giddy teenager who just received an autograph from her celebrity crush."
0,"If she could bring such joy to the villagers, Sammy felt that she would not mind continuing the façade until she left the village."
0,"The moment the epimeliad stepped back, the informal procession continued, and soon Lemi had to run to the epimeliad’s hut to drop off the gifts so that she could receive more."
0,The toothy grin on Lemi’s face and the spring in her step as she returned showed that she was thoroughly enjoying every second.
1,She nearly had a second full load of offerings by the time they reached Chloe’s hut.
0,Jenae greeted them from the entryway with Coby ruffling his feathers right beside her.
0,"With them guarding the door, none of the dryads dared approach too near."
0,Chloe sat up on her lush moss bed and smiled sweetly at Sammy.
0,Sammy couldn’t hold in her rising emotions.
0,She dove to Chloe’s bedside and embraced her dear friend who nearly died.
0,"“I’m so happy you’re okay,” Sammy whispered with a light crack in her voice."
0,Her free-flowing tears wet Chloe’s shoulder.
0,Chloe chuckled lightly and wrapped her arms around Sammy.
0,“Glad you’re awake.
0,You slept for three days.”
0,“Three days?” 
0,"Sammy looked back at Ceil in disbelieve, almost hoping that Ceil would refute what Chloe said."
0,Three days on Whinhlem was about six on Earth.
0,That would explain how weak she felt and her terrible hunger after waking.
0,"If she did not know the true cause, she would have attributed her current headache to oversleep and malnutrition."
0,“How is your recovery coming?”
0,"“I would be completely healed now if they used life magic, but they only took care of the life-threatening things.” "
0,"Chloe showed the scar in her arm from the arrow, and there was likely a similar scar on her back."
0,"“I asked them to heal her completely, but the village shaman said this way was better,” Ceil replied."
0,“Tyree said something similar in your village.”
0,“Said what?” 
0,Lemi was rummaging through the gifts in the second load she carried inside Chloe’s hut instead of dropping them off like the first.
0,“Do all Melians believe that natural healing is better than life magic?” Ceil asked.
0,“Oh! Yes.”
0, Lemi set down what looked like a carved bone necklace in her lap.
0,“Dryads view life magic differently than High Elves.
0,"We use it in emergencies, but we feel that your body grows stronger by not relying on it.”"
0,"“I thought life magic only sped up natural healing, so there should not be any difference,” Ceil countered."
0,“Well… You might be right about the injury but…”
0,"Ceil’s single response was logical enough from Sammy’s understanding of life magic to push Lemi into a corner, and Sammy felt a bit bad for her, especially because Lemi struggled to refute it."
0,"Lemi was a dryad, but she was still only a shaman’s apprentice."
0,"She probably didn’t know all the reasons behind why dryad medicinal practice was this way, but Sammy could think of a few reasons from her own education."
0,"“Maybe there is no difference with the injury, but there is probably a large difference with how the body copes with the injury or illness."
0,The body develops a resistance to diseases and infections that allow it to fight them better when it encounters them again.
0,"If you shortcut the healing process, there is little time for the body to build those defenses."
0,Same with injuries.
0,"When a part of your body is inhibited, other parts compensate for the burden and can become stronger."
0,"At least, that’s how it is with humans.”"
0,“Yes! That’s why!
0,"Thank you, Sammy."
0,I did not know how to explain it.”
0,"So, she did know, Sammy thought with a faint smile."
0,Dryads probably knew more about the body than her professors and textbooks did because of their strength in life magic.
0,"“But, I am fine with healing you whenever you want it,” Lemi added."
0,"Content with Sammy’s explanation, Lemi returned to searching through the gifts."
0,"Her eyes lit up when she removed what looked like a sarong with a zig-zagging, green and brown, ikat herringbone weave."
0,"The fringes were tasseled with tiny, glossy wood beads that clacked lightly together with every small movement of the fabric."
0,Sammy’s eyes were glued to the fine craftsmanship.
0,It was gorgeous.
0,Lemi immediately removed the makeshift skirt she had fashioned from her cloak and then tied the sarong around her waist.
0,She hopped and spun lightly as the wooden beads sung to every motion.
0,"Lemi was positively giddy, and Sammy, Chloe, and Ceil watched the exotic maiden with blushing faces."
0,"Like the beautiful white bind that Chloe had used in place of a bra, Sammy desperately wanted this sarong as well."
0,"It was given to her, but she felt guilty asking for it after seeing how well it looked on Lemi and how happy Lemi was to wear it."
0,Sammy suppressed her desires and continued watching the prancing girl.
0,"“She’s adorable,” Chloe whispered with a smile."
1,“I am most pleased that it is to your liking.
0,That dava was woven by my wife.”
0,"It was then that Sammy noticed two other occupants on the far side of the hut, the two elves who protected Chloe from the soldiers."
0,They had antler-like horns protruding from near their temples and circling the sides of their head like crowns.
0,"Their ears were different than Ceil’s, short and sharply rising to a point."
0,Their legs appeared like human or elf legs but with a digitigrade bone structure.
0,The elder of the two Elves noticed Sammy’s gaze and bowed his head.
0,"“Lady Sammy, it brings me great joy to see you up and in good health."
0,I express my utmost gratitude for your company’s aid in treating my son.” 
0,The man’s son echoed his father’s gratitude.
0,"The son, appearing about thirty years old or a little younger if he were human, sat on a moss bed similar to Chloe’s."
0,"He was shirtless with a woven grass blanket draped over his lap and legs, and the heavy scarring from the intense burns he received for covering Chloe while she was overheating made Sammy wince instinctively."
0,"“How is your son?” Sammy asked, much to the surprise of the two men and Chloe."
0,"“Benab is well despite appearances, but how is it that you know our language?"
0,Oramare is the smallest Forrest Elf province in Ghalanail.
0,Sammy sighed.
0,No foreigner would have a need to learn it.”
0,"She made a mental note to think before speaking, otherwise these exchanges would only repeat over and over again."
0,She had no idea where Oramare or Ghalanail was.
0,"She did not want to explain to everyone that the Sprite Arkhon messed with her head, so she used the first excuse that came to mind that she hoped would be more believable, letting them fill in the blanks where they will."
0,“I am good friends with Eydis FeAmel.”
0,The Forest Elf glanced at Ceil and came to his own conclusion.
0,"“The First Princess, how does she fare?”"
0,"“We don’t know,” Sammy replied with a hint of remorse, changing back to the Amel dialect of Elven, and the man nodded in understanding."
0,"“If you wish to continue discussion with your companions in private, we will leave.”"
0,"“If I may,” Benab interjected."
0,"“You will be departing soon for Vallen, correct?"
0,"With your permission, I wish to accompany you."
0,"You will be traveling through war-stricken lands, and no women should make such a dangerous journey unprotected, especially one of your standing.”"
0,"Sammy thought upon her travels with Chloe and Ceil through Fiorrae and Melia, all the times they had been lax in their apparel and manners, the countless times when they had been half or completely naked in the convenience of their company of women with Justin unconscious."
0,She did not have any plans on continuing the lie about her authority.
0,What would this man think when he finds out that she was nothing more than an inconsequential figure in this war?
0,The father noticed Sammy’s unease and rubbed his forehead between his two antlers.
0,“Please forgive my son’s impertinence.
0,I have discussed this with him many times over the past two days.
0,"To put his worries at ease, if I am not overstepping my bounds by requesting this of you, Lady Sammy, can you make a combat stance?"
0,Any stance will suffice.”
0,"Unsure what reason the man had for the odd request, Sammy did as he instructed and held a simple striking stance that Eydis had taught her for creating an opening to escape an attacker."
0,“Notice the alignment of the well points from her ankle to her hip and shoulder to her retracted strike hand?” Debin asked his son.
0,"Sammy grew more uncomfortable as Benab scanned her posture, his eyes slowly widening as if coming to some realization that not even Sammy knew."
0,"“The moment her fist extends, the dar alignment completes."
0,"If she struck your right breast, your ven would seize, and the distortion of your well points could make your heart momentarily fail."
0,"Like the grandmaster fire magician, Lady Chloe, Lady Sammy has received martial training from the royal family."
0,Your skills are in the hunt and the hunt alone.
0,You could not provide these women better protection than they can already provide themselves.
0,You could only become a hindrance and liability.”
0,"“Your son may lack skill, but you are rather knowledgeable for someone from Oramare, if I heard correctly,” Ceil replied, placing her hand on Sammy’s shoulder to signal that she could ease her stance, much to Sammy’s relief."
0,"“I was an archer for the royal guard until nearly thirty years ago, Lady Ceil, just before your late husband, Emperor Yuro, ascended the throne."
0,The untimely death of my brother called me back to Oramare to support my aging parents.”
0,"“The abilities of your son aside, someone of your experience would be highly beneficial."
0,Are you familiar with Vallen?”
0,The Forest Elf bowed his head.
0,"“Forgive me, Your Highness."
0,"My wife is much older than I and frail from age, so I cannot be your guide."
0,"You have done so much for me by treating my son alongside your companion, but I have no service to offer in return."
0,Please forgive us.”
0,"“We know Vallen,” Benab replied, much against his father’s wishes."
0,“We lived there until recently.
0,"When the armies of Tolmyur approached our village, we fled for Melia."
0,I am duty-bound to help.
0,Lady Chloe and I have stood--”
0,"“Not another word,” Debin reprimanded, gripping Benab’s arm."
0,He bowed his head to Ceil.
0,"“I am sorry, but we cannot.”"
0,“I understand.” 
0,Ceil knelt in front of them but kept the refined posture of a member of the royal family.
0,“Is this your only son?”
0,“Yes.
0,"My wife is too old to bare another, and I am too old to take a second wife of childbearing age.”"
0,"After nearly losing his son, Ceil understood why he would not let him join."
0,"“We’ll be fine on our own,” Sammy said, kneeling in front of them and attempting to mimic Ceil’s posture."
0,"“You may still be of use to us, Debin,” Ceil continued."
0,“You are familiar with Vallen and know the direction of the enemy march.
0,Can you provide us a map and order of the most likely cities they would target next?”
0,Sammy searched her memory of the negotiations and realized that a location for their battle was never given.
0,"This would make sense if the commander did not know how far the war in Vallen had progressed, but it made meeting him to return Justin far more difficult."
0,Sammy could only hold onto the Arkhon’s promise that Justin would be returned to her in good health.
0,Debin’s countenance lightened.
0,“I would be most honored.
0,Come.
0,Let us leave them to their own discussions while I prepare the map.” 
0,Debin stood and held his arm to his dejected son who grasped his wrist and stood.
0,"The grass-woven blanket covering him fell, revealing his naked, hairless body."
0,Sammy was startled but tried not to show it.
0,She half expected this would happen.
0,"People in Melia did not seem to mind nudity, or perhaps it was Whinhlem in general."
0,Jenae and Coby moved away from the entryway.
0,"Sammy watched the two men leave the hut with their tails, long enough to touch the ground if the tips at the end did not curl upwards, swinging lightly from side to side, and then returned to Chloe’s bedside."
1,Chloe’s face was turned away and so flushed that the edges of her ears glowed pink.
0,"“After seeing Justin’s so many times, you still get flustered?” "
0,"Sammy jested, causing Chloe to blush further until her ears flushed completely pink."
0,"“But the Forest Elf’s did look quite different, didn’t he?"
0,"Much thinner,” she added, forcing Chloe to recall the details of her mental image again to make her blush even harder, if that was possible."
0,"“Stop pestering her,” Ceil rebuked."
0,“What’s wrong with Chloe?
0,"Is she sick?” Lemi asked, now wearing a necklace of red winter flowers and looking very tropical in her dava."
0,"“No, she just can’t handle looking at naked men,” Sammy replied."
0,“Oh! Is this what arousal is?”
0,"Sammy burst into laughter, and both Chloe and Ceil were left wondering what was said."
0,She couldn’t even imagine how Chloe would react if she understood Lemi.
0,"After a few seconds, she tried to stifle her laughter enough to formulate a reply and to stop her head from throbbing."
0,"“No, no."
0,She’s just embarrassed.
0,Women with no experience with men are like this sometimes.”
0,“You mean she hasn’t birthed any children yet?
0,At her age?” 
0,Lemi was quite perplexed.
0,"“I haven’t either,” Sammy replied, “but I do have experience with men."
0,Many women from our world don’t have children until a bit later in life if at all.”
0,“I see.
0,I guess it’s different when you get to choose.”
0,"Content with Sammy’s explanation, Lemi returned to the pile of gifts."
0,"“How long until you recover,” Sammy asked the still-pink Chloe who was taking slow breaths to calm down."
0,"“Until the map is completed,” Ceil answered for her."
0,“I’ll order the village shaman to heal you the rest of the way.
0,She should have no reason to complain if we will be departing.”
0,"“What about Lemi?” Chloe asked, finally regaining composure."
0,"“She will not be joining us,” Ceil replied flatly."
0,“She was only helping us locate the hamadryad.
0,We cannot risk taking an anthousai with us.”
0,“Because she might be pregnant?” Chloe guessed.
0,"“That is part of it…” Ceil answered, her voice fading into worried silence."
0,Sammy knew the true reason.
0,"There was no guarantee of survival, and Ceil wanted to involve as few people as possible."
0,Only the three of them had ties to the agreement Ceil made with the Tolmyur commander.
0,“Have you told her yet?” Chloe asked.
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,She likely felt that Lemi would protest and did not know how to bring up the conversation.
0,Sammy understood the risks and felt that remaining in Melia would be best for Lemi.
0,"If the hamadryad upheld her promise, hopefully the Melians would not be pulled into the war."
0,Sammy took a deep breath.
0,"“Lemi, when you return to your village, feel free to take the dava with you."
0,It looks good on you.”
0,"“Thanks!” Lemi beamed, but then her joy melted."
0,She found the meaning hidden in Sammy’s words.
0,“Is that what you were talking about just now?
0,You don’t want me to come with you?”
0,Sammy spoke in Elven so that Ceil could be part of the conversation.
0,“We feel that it will be too dangerous to take you along.
0,"After all, we are going to war.”"
0,“No! I’m coming with!
0,I haven’t done anything for you yet.” 
0,Lemi dropped the cloth she was holding with a polished blue stone wrapped in it and knelt in front of Sammy.
0,"“I was supposed to help you convince the hamadryad because I know Ceil is fighting for the dryads, but I didn’t do anything.”"
0,"“I am not fighting for anyone,” Ceil argued."
0,“I just want this war to end.”
0,“Then let me help you end it!” 
0,"Lemi gripped her fists tightly in front of her, begging for Ceil to allow her to stay."
0,"“No, Lemi.” "
0,Sammy placed a gentle hand on her shoulder.
0,"“Is it because I am still young, because I am an Anthousai?"
0,"I might not even be pregnant, and once I leave Melia, there will be less hemma, and so it will be harder for me to get pregnant.”"
0,"“But you still might be pregnant,” Ceil said."
0,Lemi’s face grew rigid with conviction.
0,"She stood and held her hand in front of her abdomen, almost touching."
0,"“If I am not pregnant, will you let me stay with you?"
0,"If I am, I will go back to my village.”"
0,"“You are not supposed to check,” Ceil protested."
0,“Go back to your village.
0,I want you to be safe.”
0,“Ending the war is more important!
0,I want to help!
0,Promise me.
0,"If I am not pregnant, you will let me stay.”"
0,"“No,” Ceil replied."
0,"“Okay, we promise.”"
0,“Sammy!”
0,"“If we don’t make a deal somewhere, she might end up following us anyway,” Sammy told Ceil in English so that Lemi could not understand and get any ideas that may or may not already be there."
0,“At least this gives her a chance to stay in Melia on her own terms.”
0,Ceil grew conflicted but eventually caved to Sammy’s logic.
0,“Fine.
0,"If you are pregnant, you return home.”"
0,"Lemi’s breath grew short, and she hesitated to place her hand on her abdomen."
0,"She was about to break a longstanding dryad custom of not monitoring an Anthousai’s first pregnancy, as well as depriving herself of the anticipation of motherhood unique to dryads caused by unknown conception, something that she was formerly so excited about."
0,"Her hand touched her abdomen, and her breaths grew ragged."
0,"“You do not need to do this,” Ceil urged her."
0,“Just return to your village.”
0,Lemi ignored Ceil and squeezed her eyes shut.
0,"In that moment, Sammy knew the girl scanned her body for signs of pregnancy."
0,"Lemi’s breaths grew long and slow, and she opened her eyes with a faint smile."
0,“I’m not pregnant yet.
0,I’m going with you.”
0,"Ceil looked over to Jenae, the former matriarch of Lemi’s village, for help in convincing her."
0,"“If this is what the child has decided, I cannot stop her,” Jenae answered."
0,Ceil was defeated.
0,"Sammy grew uneasy about the decision and how it was made, but part of her was happy to have Lemi continue with them."
0,"The girl’s radiant personality helped improve their morale, standing in direct contrast to Ceil’s pessimism."
0,"“Gather our belongings into the epimeliad’s hut,” Ceil ordered with mild irritation."
0,"“Once the map is finished, we will depart.”"
1,"The village shaman was called over to rush Chloe’s recovery, and she finished in about an hour."
0,"During the treatment, Sammy asked Chloe why she never brought up her newfound language abilities."
0,Chloe’s reply was simple.
0,"“After I heard you speak, I just assumed that was why you were sleeping so long."
0,Was it the Arkhon?”
0,Chloe’s intuition surprised Sammy.
0,"Then again, fantastical topics were always Chloe’s forte."
1,"Inside the epimeliad’s hut, Ceil admired the map of Vallen Debin drew on a fine piece of durable tan cloth, planning which of the four remaining major cities in Vallen to travel to and the quickest route to them."
0,"Sammy, Chloe, and Lemi were left to sort through the gifts and the large addition of travel provisions supplied by the village."
0,"“There is no way we can carry all of this,” Sammy complained."
0,“And the gifts too.
0,We can’t take most of them with us.”
0,“We provide what we can.
0,"You take only what you need,” the epimeliad replied, causing an odd sense of déjà vu that Sammy suspected was from something spoken in a memory that she hadn’t understood in the past but could now."
0,"“As for the gifts, they are all meant as an expression of goodwill that one of your greatness would visit our small village."
0,"If you look closely, most are perishable or small enough that they would not hinder your travels."
0,No one will fault you if you leave their offering behind.”
0,"Lemi was already in the process of sorting out the floral wreaths, necklaces, and crowns from the two piles of gifts."
0,"Clothing, the smallest collection, was placed to the side."
0,"Sammy noticed another light blue dava, and although it was not as extravagant as the one Lemi claimed, she was eager to take it for herself."
0,"Sammy’s bra was wearing down, so she was happy that the village provided her with a green sash, and Chloe tied it for her in the same manner she had learned from Ceil, with the bow folded and pleated into small angel wings on her back."
0,The final collection of gifts was miscellaneous pieces of jewelry and other small trinkets.
0,"Their make was earthen, either crafted from carved wood or bone, and Sammy did not find any of it appealing."
0,"Excess jewelry would be a burden anyway, so she did not feel bad about leaving them."
0,“Should we pack similar to when we left Lemi’s village?” Chloe asked.
0,"“Sounds good to me,” Sammy answered."
0,"“We can always scavenge for more food, and Coby can hunt for us as well.”"
0,Coby gave a confident trill and flapped his wings proudly.
0,"“We’ll head to Nalain first,” Ceil announced, rolling up the map."
0,"“It is the closest fairy city, and given the time since Debin and Benab fled, it is also the most likely next target."
0,"There are a lot of smaller villages and another city in the path of the army, so hopefully they will slow them down enough that we can get there first.” "
,Ceil’s expression darkened.
,"“The faster we can meet them in battle, the quicker this war will end.”"
0,"Chapter 3
“Preparations for War”"
1,"“Clear camp with haste,” Lieutenant Kolbur shouted to his men."
0,“The emperor’s widow is within our grasp.
0,We must join Captain Byurk in securing her capture before she can slither into another burrow.”
0,Kolbur repeated the same words each morning to remind his men of the urgency of their mission.
0,"Five days ago, a messenger arrived at the Amelian palace stating that the wife of the late emperor was sighted in the Melia province of Dhuillir."
0,It came with the news that Captain Byurk would lead a small platoon to capture her while his main force continued to Vallen to transport much needed provisions.
0,Kolbur’s small army of one hundred swift-footed men was en route to aid Captain Byurk in the wife’s capture.
0,"Dressed in light leather and composed solely of rangers and scouts, his army could move consistently at three times the standard marching pace."
0,"Even so, to reach the far northwestern province of Dhuillir would take another fifteen days."
0,"Within that time, the wife could escape to any of the three Dhuillir provinces bordering Melia, to Fiorrae where they would have no hope of capturing her without Commanding General Jethro’s aid, or even back to Vallen."
0,"He hoped that the dryads would support Captain Byurk in her capture, but seeing the outward hostility of the dryads bordering Amel, he was doubtful."
0,"Their camp consisted of no more than a few small fires and woolen cloaks to ward off the cold night, so closing camp should have been quick."
0,“Too slow!”
0,"The men were tired from their swift march, which was more of a jog, and the half-rest they were allotted each night was insufficient to fully recover their stamina."
0,"Kolbur was the most tired of the group, but he dared not show it."
0,"Scouts and rangers never rose in rank to become officers, and although he was chosen to lead the march because of his stamina, he lacked the same endurance these men possessed."
0,“Lieutenant!” 
0,The forward scout Kolbur sent at the start of their march called back from down the trodden dirt road.
0,"Any time a forward scout returned, ill news surely followed."
0,The scout was not alone.
0,Another man jogged beside him with his arm slung over the scout’s shoulder.
0,"The man wore no armor, carried no weapon, and his feet were bound in rags stained with blood."
0,Kolbur ran to his scout.
0,"Their dark eyes showed they had run straight through the night, possibly two nights, without rest."
0,"When he reached them, the scout lowered the man who then fell to his knees, lacking the strength to stand."
0,"“Son, who are you."
0,Tell me what happened.”
0,"“I bring news from Byurk,” the messenger stated without so much as a breath to recover and without care for the respect of titles and rank."
0,“I must reach Amel.
0,I must warn Jethro.” 
0,The messenger lurched forward and coughed a spray of blood.
0,"His excessive exertion lead to hemorrhaging, and there was no way for Kolbur to know how serious the injury was."
0,“Speak!
0,What news do you carry?”
0,“We cannot fight the wife of the emperor as we are.
0,We will lose.”
0,Kolbur turned to his men who had finished preparations and now stood in file.
0,“Change of course!
0,We return to Amel!” 
0,He selected two of his strongest men to carry the scout and planned a rotation of the burden among his men as they kept a double pace back to the palace.
0,"“Son, in case you do not survive, tell me everything you know.”"
0,"Ill news, indeed."
1,"* * *
Seven generals and twelve captains sat along a long redwood table in the grand banquet hall of the Amelian Palace."
0,The large crystalline windows that showered dancing rainbows on the marbled hall did little to lighten the suffocating aura born by the lone lieutenant and messenger who called the emergency meeting to session.
0,"The messenger was a skilled archer under the command of Captain Byurk, the officer that their Commanding General placed in charge of the Vallen campaign despite Byurk not holding the rank of General."
0,"Captain Byurk had thousands of men under his command to bring provisions to the soldiers in Vallen, and yet somehow he had no scout to send what he claimed was an urgent message."
0,"The messenger nearly died, and had he, the news he bore would have been lost."
0,"“I respect our great Commanding General’s judgement, but his trust in Captain Byurk is ill placed."
0,He only made him captain due to their hunter mercenary connections and involvement in the Coastal War.
0,He is not even of Tolmyur.”
0,"“He was but was exiled, the last of the traitorous House Boromek.” "
0,“To leave such a large and vital caravan in the hands of an inexperience lieutenant!
0,What foolishness!”
0,"“The widow is important, but the lives of tens of thousands of our men are more important."
0,What will happen if the rations are lost due to the incompetence of the lieutenant he placed in charge?”
0,“How many of our men would starve or die from their inability to fight at full strength?”
0,“And to think that Byurk’s messenger would convince the support army we sent to return.
0,What folly!”
0,"“Perhaps you misjudged Kolbur as well, General Lamek.” "
0,"While the generals and many of the captains questioned the competency of Captain Byurk and thus the validity of whatever message they were about to hear, Kolbur fought within himself whether to throw out the notion of authority and demand the messenger be given his time to speak, but his chance for decision passed."
0,"“To question Captain Byurk’s appointment is to question our great Commanding General,” the messenger shouted."
0,“I would question your own loyalty before you question his.”
0,The many eyes around the table glared at the messenger in animosity.
0,"Without rank, Kolbur knew the messenger’s words would result in severe punishment and possibly execution after the message was given."
0,"The messenger was prepared to die for the news he bore, and that strength gave Kolbur the courage to speak."
0,"“If I may, leave your judgement of the validity of the message until after you hear it.” "
0,"Kolbur found what he learned on the return to Amel difficult to believe, and he did not want to believe it, but one so trusted by the Commanding General would not tell such an egregious lie."
0,"The angry faces around the table grew complacent, and the right to speak was handed to the messenger."
0,"“As you learned from Captain Byurk’s initial message, the widow of the emperor was spotted in Melia in the company of humans who fought on her side."
0,I was a member of an elite team led by Captain Byurk to capture her.
0,We quickly learned that she no longer desired to hide and was now in open opposition against us.
0,Her reason for entering Melia was due to the appearance of a hamadryad.
0,That hamadryad has taken root in Melia and now supports the wife.”
0,Whispers rose among the generals and captains.
0,“You are telling us that now the fairies and dryads have chosen to support the widow?”
0,"“Not quite, Captain Setch."
0,"Although the Hamadryad has taken root, she can only influence those who accept her, but we still estimate that at about a third of Dhuillir.”"
0,The whispers grew to audible conversation.
0,General Lamek raised his hand to silence the room.
0,“A third of Dhuillir is about the same in population as all of Vallen.
0,You are telling us that an army the size of a nation we could only defeat in piecemeal without our Commanding General could organize against us?”
0,"“Yes, but if that was all, I would praise our good fortune,” the messenger said, his face growing sterner."
0,“What good fortune could such an army be?!”
0,“Can we hope to fight such an army while our Commanding General remains in the other world?!”
0,"Angry shouts rose from the table, but General Lamek stood to silence them."
0,He alone caught hold upon the dark omen hidden in the messenger’s words.
0,“You carry worse tidings than a dryad uprising.
0,What happened?”
0,Kolbur’s body shook from a fear he could not explain.
0,What the messenger was about to say could be the tidings of a war that Tolmyur had no hope of winning.
0,"“The reason we could not capture the wife, and the reason we could not stop the hamadryad from taking root and supporting her… "
0,We have learned that the other world has joined the war in support of the widow of the emperor.” 
0,"Kolbur expected the commanders to shout accusations or voice their doubts or ask any number of questions, but all were silent."
0,A somber air hung over the room.
0,There was something the Generals and Captains stationed at the palace knew that they withheld from him and other lower-ranked soldiers.
0,The fear Kolbur felt became a physical weight that sank his heart into his stomach.
0,"Grateful for the silence, the messenger continued his report."
0,"“Of those with the wife, there were humans with incredible power."
0,A single fire mage could conjure a fireball grander than any fire elemental or multitude of minums.
0,Its flame clings to all it touches like cold oil and burns with the heat of a refiner’s fire.
0,Almost our entire elite squad was killed by only one of her attacks.
0,Even our fire mages could not resist its heat.”
0,A palpable darkness hung over the room as if a stormcloud had covered the sun and blocked the light from shining through the crystalline window.
0,"The light still shined, and the shattered rainbows still danced, but no one saw them."
0,"“Another man,” the messenger continued, causing shocked faces to rise as if saying, “There’s more?” "
0,"“Despite being human, he is a time mage."
0,"Captain Byurk could not harm him, even when the man was terribly injured."
0,He fears this man could become as powerful or is already as powerful as our Commanding General.”
0,"General Lamek was the only man at the table who managed to keep his composure, being the most veteran of the Generals present."
0,“Do you have an estimate of their numbers?” 
0,"“We do not, but Captain Byurk believes there are only few at present."
0,"He feels this might not be unlike our initial efforts to capture the princess, sending small numbers to assess the situation before a much larger force is brought."
0,"With this belief as an anchor, Captain Byurk has challenged the widow to battle in Vallen."
0,"He worded the challenge such that the dryads would not be involved, but I do not know if the wife will keep such an agreement.”"
0,“Do you have any confidence that the wife will meet him in battle?
0,Could she not take her dryad forces and those from the other world and attempt to reclaim Amel?”
0,"“Byurk has the time mage in his custody, and from how the negotiations played out, this man is of great importance, enough to force the widow to action."
0,Captain Byurk is confident that she will meet him in battle to reclaim him.
0,"If she does not, the man’s life is forfeit once the campaign in Vallen ends."
0,The dryad shaman charged with his care and recovery has agreed to this and will provide the means for Captain Byurk to end his life.”
0,Silence fell on the room.
0,General Lamek sat down and crossed his arms pensively on the table.
0,“Is that the end of your report?”
0,"“Yes, but I can answer questions if you have them.” "
0,General Lamek shook his head.
0,"“If we have questions, we will send it to you in writing."
0,"Lieutenant Kolbur, escort him to the parlor and wait there."
0,We will be discussing confidential information from here.”
0,"As Kolbur expected, the moment the messenger mentioned humans from the other world, he knew something happened."
0,They became far too attentive far too quickly.
0,"He desperately wanted to be part of the meeting, but as a lieutenant, it was not his place, no matter how his dread-filled curiosity yearned for it."
0,"He saluted to General Lamek and led the messenger out the large redwood door, closing it behind him."
1,"* * *
“Do you think Captain Byurk’s messenger is credible?” a captain across from General Lamek asked everyone present."
0,"“Given the emergency communication from Commanding General Jethro, it is likely,” Lamek replied, feeling the unease of his own words twitching on the corners of his mustache."
0,"“Then you also feel the two are connected,” General Pelette mumbled from beside Lamek, and those who heard nodded."
0,It seemed all who were present made the connection.
0,"“First Jethro’s voice appears and tells us the siege of the otherworld city has failed, and now this.”"
0,"“In all my time in our Commanding General’s service, I have never heard him so panicked, so afraid,” the only captain who was present during the message replied from the end of the table."
0,“I cannot help but feel we have disturbed a chimera’s nest.”
0,"“Part of me worries that in his own fear, the messenger may have exaggerated many of the details,” General Pelette accused."
0,For humans to hold such magical power was not easy to believe.
0,“And if he wasn’t?” Lamek countered.
0,“We all know the power of our Commanding General.
0,Who is to say that more humans with similar strength could not exist?
0,This becomes more plausible if they are not from Tolmyur or even Whinhlem.”
0,"“But I thought the humans of the other world could not use magic,” one of the captains asked."
0,"“That is what makes this all the less believable,” General Pelette chided."
0,"“General Pelette, you were not present during Captain Fect’s report before the siege on the city in the other world."
0,The doppelganger learned that those humans are capable of magic.
0,The princess was personally training the civilians closest to her.
0,"Perhaps magic is not taught to the common folk, so none of the citizens could make use of it."
0,"If soldiers or other special operatives are trained in the art, that would explain why those Captain Byurk encountered, those sent to our world to aid the wife, could use it."
0,Their incredible skill gives this theory further credibility.”
0,“What do we do with this knowledge and the plan Captain Byurk has constructed?” the youngest General asked.
0,“The most dangerous part of disturbing a chimera’s nest is not knowing its strengths or abilities.
0,"If the other world is far stronger than our Commanding General assumed, do we even have the strength to defend against it?”"
0,"“Should we return our armies to Amel and prepare for a defense against the wife and her force of dryads,” General Bregon suggested, his deep voice reverberating and echoing through the hall."
0,Everyone weighed his suggestion in their minds.
0,"As the second most senior of the generals, every suggestion General Bregon made was always taken under careful consideration."
0,"He would not have spoken without having thoroughly scrutinized every pro and con, but something in Lamek’s war instinct told him such a proposal was doomed to fail."
0,He just couldn’t find why he felt so.
0,"While the generals and captains entertained General Bregon’s drastic idea, Lamek pondered on every word in Captain Byurk’s message."
0,Lamek found the string that tied the plan together.
0,Perhaps Jethro was correct in placing such trust in Byurk.
0,Captain Byurk’s plot was genius.
0,"It was still based on a fair bit of assumption, but having experienced firsthand the power of those supporting the widow, Byurk would know best his probability of success."
0,Lamek now knew why he had sent a messenger back to Amel with the precise message he bore.
0,"“No, General Bregon,” Lamek interrupted, silencing the discussion."
0,"“Recalling our forces now would seal our destruction at the hands of the combined forces of the dryads, fairies, and the armies of the other world."
0,The widow knows Jethro cannot help us in this fight.
0,"Because she is receiving help from the other world, she may know better than us what happened to our Commanding General.”"
0,“Are you saying that our Commanding General is lost?” General Pelette asked with a troubled face.
0,"Jethro was the hope of all Tolmyur, and there were none at the table who would want to believe for even a moment that Jethro was killed."
0,"“I cannot say, but Captain Byurk’s plan was made with the knowledge that we would not be able to receive Commanding General Jethro’s aid."
0,I fully support Captain Byurk’s plan.
0,Fighting in Vallen gives us our best chance of victory.”
0,Whispers and conversations grew in the hall but were quickly silenced by the deep voice of General Bregon.
0,“What reason have you found?”
0,"“It relies heavily on what Captain Byurk saw, but the underlying reason is the number of otherworlders currently on Whinhlem.” "
0,General Bregon’s face grew stiff and then the light of epiphany lit in his eyes.
0,“I support Captain Byurk’s plan.”
0,Frustrated conversations erupted once more.
0,"All but the two most senior Generals felt that fortifying their defenses in Amel was the best way to weather the coming storm in the absence of their Commanding General, but neither General Lamek nor General Bregon would back down."
0,Captain Byurk had provided them not only the best means of survival but also a swift victory over the remnants clinging to the former Amelian Empire.
1,"* * *
Tolmyur’s armies numbered half a million strong."
0,King Azen relinquished half of their total strength for Jethro’s assault on Amel and to solidify their hold on the fallen capital.
0,"This severely weakened their homeland, but revenge against the elves was a dream every soul in Tolmyur held dear, and no one questioned the risk."
0,"And should the army fall, it could be rebuilt quickly through conscription."
0,"Of the nearly 250 thousand stationed in the Amelian Empire, about half was given by Jethro to Captain Byurk to search Vallen for the fleeing wife and to quell any fairy resistance."
0,"The aggression and tenacity of the fairies led to a flash genocide campaign, costing nearly 50 thousand of Captain Byurk’s men before he was forced to return to Amel to recover from an assassination attempt."
0,"With nearly 80 thousand still fighting in Vallen under the acting captain, Lieutenant Soppet, General Lamek planned to send an additional 60 thousand to aid Captain Byurk in his battle against the wife."
0,"“This won’t be enough,” General Bregon said, looking over the many tents from atop the outer walls of Amel."
0,Behind him the faint cries of the city drifted through the breeze as the soldiers claimed what little remaining food stores the impoverished former capital held.
0,"Deep down, he wished they could purge the city of elves so that the soldiers could claim it for themselves, but his Commanding General wanted the city to suffer."
0,A swift death like the fairies’ was too kind a punishment.
0,"Even with their current seizure of food, the city was better than many in Tolmyur."
0,"“Not enough manpower, and not enough food,” General Lamek agreed."
0,Captain Byurk’s message was a call for reinforcements.
0,"Even though the fairies lost much of their formal army in their failed attempt to reclaim Amel, their numbers were still formidable."
0,"The genocide campaign forced the fairies to turn every able body into a combatant, men, women, and also children."
0,"Even without proper military training, their overwhelming numbers led to many losses."
0,"“Are we making the right choice,” Lamek mumbled, questioning his decision."
0,"“Your judgement was correct,” General Bregon affirmed."
0,"“If what the messenger said is true, if what Captain Byurk has seen is true, then there are currently few otherworlders on Whinhlem."
0,"If we do not strike now, we have no hope."
0,The weakened Vallen will prove an advantageous battleground.
0,"The proximity of the final fairy cities to Melia and the rate of extermination under Lieutenant Soppet will prevent the widow from rallying the dryads, or at least many of them, the Melians and Itians at most."
0,She will not have the time.
0,"If she delays in her arrival, the war in Vallen will end and her important companion’s life is forfeit."
0,"If we fell back to Amel, she would have time to rally the fairies and dryads, and there will be ample time for more otherworlders to arrive."
0,"If the soldiers in their armies are as individually powerful as those Captain Byurk encountered, we would lose, and they could strike back against Tolmyur.”"
0,"“If we can defeat the widow there, the other world will have less incentive to get involved."
0,The fairies will be extinguished.
0,The dryads will lose their benefactor and submit once again to us.
0,Our claim on Amel and victory over the Amelian Empire will be assured.”
0,Lamek rested his hands on the crenel and looked down at the gateway below where two soldiers pulled a handcart of grain towards the encampment.
0,“But that depends heavily on our victory.
0,"Seeing the supplies we have now and the men we can safely send without weakening our hold on Amel, I worry we will still lose.”"
0,"“I have been thinking on this, and I feel I have a solution."
0,"I had the chef staff work on it throughout the morning, and it should be finished."
0,Follow me.”
1,General Bregon led Lamek back through the main streets of Amel to the palace.
0,"The wide, white-brick roads were active with soldiers breaking into homes to take any non-perishable food they could find and add to their handcarts."
0,"Angry cries and protests of the citizens went unanswered, and those who rose to defend their homes were quickly disposed of and tossed into the street as a message to all who saw."
0,"The handcarts kept a wide breadth from General Bregon and Lamek, and the soldiers who pulled them nodded their heads in respect to their superior officers, being unable to remove their hands from the carts."
1,"Inside the palace, General Bregon led Lamek back to the dining hall and through the servant’s passageways to the kitchen where four distraught spriggans sat on simple stools or on the floor against the far wall."
0,"A viscous, clear liquid with a faint green tint covered their white aprons."
0,Neither of them lifted their heads to acknowledge the giant and dwarf’s presence.
0,"“Have you finished?” General Bregon asked, his deep voice causing the two women sitting on the stools to cower, but no one answered."
0,Lamek found the posture of the two men against the wall odd.
0,"He walked over and inspected the bodies, finding them dead."
0,"There was no physical injury, but neither of them had a pulse."
0,There were no signs of strangulation or visible aftereffects of poison.
0,He kicked one of them to the ground and stepped on his chest.
0,Water seeped from the chef’s mouth onto the rough stone floor.
0,A spriggan chef was bound to have a water affinity.
0,The two spriggans drowned themselves.
0,“What order did you give these chefs?” Lamek asked.
0,"General Bregon grabbed the arm of one of the petite women who had an odd silver mark between her brows, possibly a symbol of status or religion that he did not know."
0,He lifted her to eye level letting her dangle in the air so that she had no choice but to look at him.
0,"“Have you finished,” he repeated, releasing her to the ground."
0,"Tears fell from the woman’s eyes, and she nodded."
0,“Show me.”
0,The two spriggans rushed out of the kitchen to the storage room and returned with a plain wooden platter.
0,Various types of what looked like diced or dried vegetable were arranged on top.
0,“Is it safe to eat?”
0,The two chefs nodded slowly.
0,“Show me.”
0,Terror grew on the two women’s faces.
0,"Lamek thought at first that their fear was due to adding poison or other ill ingredients to the food prepared for the general, but his intuition told him otherwise."
0,Why did the two male chefs kill themselves after preparing the dish?
0,They would not have done so if it was simply poisoned.
0,General Bregon grabbed one of the chefs by the hair and pushed her face into the platter.
0,“Eat it!”
0,The spriggan grabbed a cube of the diced vegetable with her trembling hand and placed it in her mouth.
0,Tears streamed down her cheeks as she chewed it and swallowed.
0,"The other chef, unable to hold her stomach, vomited on the floor."
0,General Bregon held the spriggan to prevent her from taking any unnecessary action.
0,"After waiting in tense silence, no ill effects surfaced, but when he released her, she sat down on the floor and placed her hands to her mouth."
0,Water and mucus shot from her nose from the high-pressure water magic.
0,She fought to contain her coughs and spasms until she too fell to her side having drowned.
0,“What vegetable is this?” Lamek asked.
0,“Why would these chefs kill themselves?” 
0,"“It’s dryad,” General Bregon finally replied."
0,He grabbed a cube of diced dryad and tossed it in his mouth.
0,His raised eyebrow showed that the flavor may not have been all too unpleasant.
0,“The quickest way to the final fairy cities is through Dhuillir.
0,"Dryads are plants, just like any other."
0,We can conscript the dryads still faithful to Tolmyur.
0,Those who rebel we know have sided with the widow.
0,We can use them to feed our armies.”
0,General Bregon grabbed the final chef by the arm and pushed her towards the supply room.
0,“Bring the rest.”
0,The chef staggered off and around the corner out of sight.
0,"“Where did you find a dryad,” Lamek asked, tossing a cube into his mouth."
0,"The texture was fibrous, and the flavor was slightly bitter but palatable, better tasting than most army field rations."
0,He could easily see this being a viable food source.
0,"“As you know, one of the strengths of the dryads is in their ability to move almost unnoticed in nature should they choose to do so."
0,The gardeners of the palace were replaced by dryads a year ago when some strange disease caused most of the plants on the palace grounds to wilt and blacken.
0,"The high and mighty elves were not strong enough alone to combat the disease, so they summoned dryads."
0,Most our soldiers did not notice they were living among us.
0,"I did not until recently, as terrifying as that prospect is."
0,"Had the emperor more forethought, he could have trained them as secret guards instead of gardeners.”"
0,“But how did they cook them?
0,Any fire and dryads ignite like dry kindling.”
0,“That is what I am here to discover.” 
0,The chef returned dragging a burlap sack.
0,"Lamek could tell immediately that it contained bodies, or parts of bodies, from how the coarse fabric bulged."
0,General Bregon retrieved the sack from the spriggan and dumped the contents onto the table.
0,The dismembered limbs and sectioned torsos of two unused dryads spilt onto the table and floor.
0,"The life sap of the dryads left the body parts sticky, and strings of sap bridged between them and the sack as he tossed it aside."
0,"“Explain how to prepare them,” General Bregon ordered."
0,The chef quivered and grabbed a knife.
0,"She demonstrated how to carve the meat on the limbs from the tough, fibrous cores that made up the skeletal structure."
0,"The torsos were of little use with how little meat was on the typically lithe dryads, so only the arms and legs could be salvaged."
0,"The only feasible way to eat a dryad was raw or boiled, but once boiled a water mage could extract the moisture to preserve it, creating a texture not unlike jerky."
0,"Extracting moisture without boiling hardened the flesh like wood, making it inedible, and no amount of boiling could return it to something palatable."
0,This was all General Bregon and Lamek needed to know.
0,"Preparation was simple enough to perform on the march, and dried dryad was incredibly light."
0,"“You are a genius,” Lamek complimented with a pat on General Bregon’s leg as they walked out of the kitchen."
0,"“With this, we have a chance."
0,I wish I could join you in the battle.”
0,General Bregon grunted.
0,“I cannot understand the dwarven obsession with the honor of battle.
0,You oversee Amel in our Commanding General’s absence.
0,There could be no greater honor.
0,Do not fret.
0,I will bring us victory in Vallen.”
0,"Once the Tolmyur commanders walked out of sight, the final chef slit her throat with her knife."
0,"Chapter 4
“The Real Monster”
Byurk"
1,"“Byurk, we must stop the march."
0,He is growing worse.” 
0,Tyree wove nimbly through the trees of the steep slope to the right of the hillside path to reach Captain Byurk who led the march.
0,The nine soldiers glared at the dryad as she passed.
0,This was the fourth time that day she had requested the march be stopped.
0,Byurk grumbled within himself as his hand reached for his blade.
0,He contemplated how he could kill the dryad to end her incessant pestering on their prisoner’s behalf.
0,"If her life magic could overpower his earth magic, perhaps water magic or rigid steel might work."
0,"He complied with her first request earlier in the morning when they had space to stop, but the path they followed was now more ravine than glen."
0,"His men marched single file through the slick mud, ever conscious of the steep four-meter decline to their left that ended in a rocky stream."
0,This was no place for a break.
0,"“Then heal him,” Byurk ordered."
0,“I thought you dryads were proficient with these things.”
0,Tyree slid down the steep embankment in front of Byurk and walked backwards in front of him following his pace with incredible perception of where she placed each step.
0,"“I thought I did, but the symptoms have resurfaced far stronger than before."
0,"Unless I take time to thoroughly investigate the cause, I fear we may not be able to uphold our end of the agreement.”"
0,Return him in good health… 
0,Byurk regretted his poor wording in his agreement with the widow of the emperor.
0,"A hostage, a prisoner, should never be treated as a priority charge."
0,"If the otherworlder succumbed to illness despite the dryad’s efforts to heal him, Byurk felt a breach of their agreement was justified."
0,His death would have been out of their control.
0,"It would even be beneficial to their upcoming battle by having one less otherworlder present, especially if this man was equivalent to Jethro in ability."
0,“We will clear the Mailan Hills and enter Vallen if we continue through the night.
0,"If he survives until then, you can investigate his condition thoroughly.”"
0,"Tyree stopped walking, forcing Byurk and the rest of this men to halt."
0,“He may not last that long without proper treatment.
0,"You ignored my last two requests to stop, and his symptoms are worsening at a much greater pace.”"
0,Byurk’s grip on his blade tightened.
0,“Then do something about it while we march.
0,I thought you were one of the best shamans in all of Melia.
0,Was that a lie?
0,Or perhaps you are purposely stalling us to provide the widow ample time to prepare for battle.
0,I thought you despised her manipulation of the Melians as much as I did.”
0,"When Tyree could not answer, he pushed her aside into the embankment and continued the march."
0,"Thick briers grew from the path in front, rising to his height and preventing passage."
0,Byurk turned to see Tyree digging her hand into the soil of the embankment.
0,"He drew his sword, and his men who were not holding the stretcher followed."
0,"“You overstep your freedoms, dryad!"
0,We are close enough to Vallen that we no longer need you as a guide.
0,I am not against ending you here and letting fate decide whether that man lives or dies.”
0,Tyree retracted her hands and shook off the dirt and mud.
0,"“You lost your fire mages, and this forest is blooming with life."
0,"You had best hope you can remove my head, because little else will kill a dryad quickly."
0,I am only here to make certain the battle happens and the war ends.
0,"So long as this man survives, Lady Ceil has stake in the agreement and will uphold her side."
0,You and your men are not important to the agreement.
0,I am not against killing you all and taking him to Vallen myself.
0,We are still in Melia.
0,I can find dryads to assist me in your place.”
0,Byurk sheathed his sword.
0,"If this was a bluff, it was a convincing bluff."
0,"She had skill in the medical aspects of life magic which meant she could harm just as well as she could heal, and she had both bound him easily and restricted his earth magic in the past."
0,"He did not know her strength in combat, but there was little doubt in his mind that some of his men would die if he ordered the attack, especially with their limited mobility in the narrow terrain."
0,“Remove the briers.
0,We will continue the march.
0,"If at any time the path widens and has stable enough footing, we will rest long enough for you to investigate the otherworlder’s illness."
0,Is this agreeable?”
0,"Tyree dug her hands into the soil, and the briers flattened to the ground, wilted, and buried themselves into the mud."
0,"The agitation of the soil from the briers made the path far slicker, but the dead plants beneath the mud created a mesh that allowed them to cross so long as they stepped flat-footed."
1,The march continued.
0,"Tyree tried to investigate the otherworlder’s illness, but the narrow path made this difficult."
0,"She could not stand beside the stretcher for long because of the trees and brush along the slope, and she could not reach him from in front or behind the soldiers carrying the stretcher."
0,Byurk had to wonder why Tyree suggested this ill-fated path that disadvantaged her aid of the otherworlder.
0,"They could have backtracked to the main road the army had widened and followed it to Vallen far more comfortably, and it would have enabled her to treat the otherworlder through the march, even if it took longer."
0,"Then again, she could not have known he would grow ill with a sudden mysterious sickness."
0,The otherworlder’s health was suspect from the start.
0,The widow brought him to Melia to find him treatment.
0,He was sick to a degree that Tyree called him a living corpse.
0,"Even after treatment, he was weak and rarely woke."
0,"Now the ailment plaguing him was growing worse, and one of the self-proclaimed best shamans in Melia did not know the cause."
0,Byurk wanted so desperately to dump him in the forest and be done.
0,"While Byurk entertained this thought, possibly telling Tyree to find those Melians she claimed she could ask to carry him so that he and his soldiers could rejoin the conflict in Vallen much faster, he heard the light roar of water."
0,"The mud path reached a small, waterfall-fed spring."
0,"It was located down the steep embankment, but there appeared to be weathered stone steps."
0,"Beside the spring sat a barren oval altar covered in moss with enough flat, dry stone for his men to rest."
0,Byurk groaned within himself.
0,"He could argue that because it was not on the path, they did not need to stop, but he knew Tyree would complain to no end."
0,"“We rest here while Tyree cares for the otherworlder,” he announced."
1,"He descended the steep decline first, widening and hardening the crumbling stone steps as he walked to ensure the safety of his men."
0,"The slightly elevated, circular stone platform the altar sat on was clearly elven in make, or at least embellished by elven hands, but its purpose eluded him."
0,"He felt damaged ven channels through the stone, so perhaps there was some enchantment upon it that was now useless."
0,"It was long abandoned, and any markings that may have been there to reveal its purpose had long eroded away."
0,"The spring looked clear, but before he gave his men permission to drink, he placed his hand in the water and used water magic to assess the purity."
0,“The water is clean.
0,"Take advantage of this rest, because we will be marching through the night.”"
0,The two soldiers carrying the stretcher set it down atop the altar for convenience.
0,"The poles hung slack on the sides, and the otherworlder’s legs dangled off the end."
0,"Byurk sat by the spring and watched Tyree circle the unconscious man, placing her hand on various parts of his body from his head to his chest, stomach, and groin."
0,"Each time she performed some investigation, she grew more and more confused and soon she began pacing around the altar pensively."
0,"Now that Byurk had the leisure to see him, the otherworlder looked pale and was sweating heavily."
0,His breaths were shallow as if breathing deep agitated whatever pain tormented him.
0,He wondered if he could kill him now while Tyree was distracted.
0,"At this point, it may be considered a mercy."
0,"If it was just for the convenience of their march, there would be no point in killing him."
0,"He already allowed the break, and from the look of his men, they were grateful for it."
0,He would need a better reason.
0,Tyree’s pacing ceased.
0,"Her pointer finger hung on her lower lip, peeling it outward, as she looked down to the side at the unconscious man."
0,"Her other hand reached for his forehead, and once it touched, she retracted it quickly as if she had placed it too close to a flame."
0,"Tyree immediately dropped to her knees and placed her forehead against his, and after a few seconds, she broke away and scooted back in shock."
0,"“What did you find?” Byurk asked, the stench of foreboding entering his nostrils."
0,“Have you found the cause of the illness?”
0,“Yes…” Tyree hesitated.
0,“There is a rare condition among elves.
0,I did not think to check for it at first.
0,"It is separate from the physical body, but its effects can be just as deadly as any illness.”"
0,Byurk’s anticipation angered him.
0,“Speak! What is it?”
0,"“When the body absorbs ven, those with this illness process it wrong, and it becomes toxic."
0,This man has no more healthy ven in his body.
0,It is all poison.
0,"He continues to absorb more, but the excess poisonous ven cannot escape."
0,It is building and killing him.
0,"To my knowledge, there is no cure."
0,"I did not know humans could have it, and this is my first time seeing someone with a case as severe as I see here.”"
0,The stench of foreboding dissipated and was replaced by sweet relief.
0,This was terrific news.
0,"“If he cannot be cured, kill him and be done.”"
0,"“The illness has no cure, but the effects can be mitigated."
0,"However…” Tyree approached the altar and placed her hand on the man’s forehead, immediately retracting it again the moment she touched."
0,"“A very large ven capacity is a common side effect of the illness, but there is no excuse for this.”"
0,Byurk’s anxiety crept over him once again.
0,"“What do you mean?” he asked slowly, tasting each word."
0,His soldiers were now attentively listening to the discussion.
0,"“To mitigate the effects, all the toxic ven must be expelled, but then clean ven needs to replace it immediately or his health will worsen, and in his weakened state from his prolonged injury and malnutrition, any hesitation could kill him.”"
0,Tyree’s explanation did not explain what there was “no excuse for.” 
0,It sounded like a matter of course.
0,The otherworlder was weak and needed his ven replaced.
0,“Use your ven and let us continue our march.”
0,"Tyree shook her head, and as Byurk suspected, there was more."
0,“I will not be enough.”
0,Byurk grew confused.
0,All elfkind were supposed to be far superior to humans in ven capacity.
0,Many surpassed his fellow minums.
0,"Even if the ven cost of her investigation was exorbitant, he did not doubt any dryad of her age and skill would be able to replenish the average human’s ven many times over with much to spare."
0,"Then again, this was not an average human."
0,"“How large is his capacity,” Byurk asked, fearing the answer."
0,"“Even if we use the ven of all present here, he will not escape the critical levels, and he may still die."
0,"Our only choice is to find a Melian village and use all their ven, and then we might only be close to safety.”"
0,"An entire dryad village, and only then just barely safe?"
0,How powerful is this human?
0,"Jethro had an incredible ven capacity, and Byurk suspected that it was much larger than any elf, but he had seen Jethro exhaust his ven on multiple occasions, especially in the Coastal War."
0,"Jethro was human, a talented and gifted human, but human nonetheless."
0,This otherworlder was a monster.
1,"Byurk stomped his foot into the altar platform, and Tyree barely yanked the otherworlder off the altar before a large spike shot up."
0,"“Men, use any means necessary!"
0,Kill the otherworlder!”
0,"Unlike the forest path, Byurk was in his element at the spring."
0,There was plenty of stone and water with very little vegetation besides small water plants and moss.
0,"His earth magic was of the school of manipulation, so he needed stone or soil to use it, but he was both a conjurer and manipulator of water, his dominant element."
0,The spring and damp air were powerful weapons at his disposal.
0,"Of his soldiers, he had one earth mage, one water mage--both conjurers who did not need the spring or stone to fight--and seven swordsmen."
0,"Without vegetation, the dryad could not hope to protect that monster."
0,"In desperation for a weapon, Tyree grabbed the poles of the stretcher that fell to the sides of the altar when the folded leather lost the support of the otherworlder’s weight."
0,"She deflected the first sword thrust at her using the pole in her left hand, but the edge of the blade slid deep into her left arm at the elbow."
0,"The wound would have been debilitating for an elf, ridding them of the use of their arm, but Byurk knew such a wound was trivial to a dryad and would heal quickly."
0,"While Tyree was distracted by the first swordsman and the spikes of ice flying at her from the water mage, Byurk stomped his heel into the stone again."
0,"He could not see the otherworlder on the other side of the altar, but he knew he was there by what he sensed through the altar’s stone platform."
0,"His earth ven traveled and formed the spike that would end him, but the spike was restricted."
0,There were no plants with strong roots she could use to resist his magic.
0,The second pole in Tyree’s right hand--she never used it to defend and kept it angled down to where the otherworlder lay.
0,"When Tyree grew roots from the end of the pole in her left hand to snare the swordsman’s wrist and wrench the sword from his grip, Byurk found his answer."
0,"Tyree was in charge of the otherworlder, so she was always with the stretcher when they rested for the night."
0,"Unknown to him, she had nourished the poles as conduits for her life magic."
0,The wood was full of life.
0,"She remained disadvantaged, but she was not as defenseless as Byurk had originally suspected."
0,“Push her back towards the stream away from the otherworlder!”
0,His two mages circled to the embankment so that their magic might force Tyree towards the stream.
0,The disarmed swordsman broke free of the roots binding his wrist and stepped back so that two others could take his place.
0,A single branch grown from the left pole snared the handle of the fallen sword and brandished it like a multi-jointed third arm.
0,The single branch held back one swordsman while she used the pole to defend against the second.
0,"The mages became more cautious with their attacks to prevent friendly fire, but their accuracy was fitting for elite soldiers hand-selected by Byurk."
0,A stone spike impaled Tyree’s left knee through the gap between one swordsman’s legs.
0,An ice spike shattered on Tyree’s immobile right arm that held its vice grip on the pole protecting the otherworlder.
0,Byurk stomped forward and thrust his palms as if pushing a heavy object.
0,The Altar fractured and toppled over on the otherworlder.
0,He checked quickly through the stone with the hope that some of the large fragments of stone had crushed him.
0,"There was perhaps a broken arm and leg, but something supported the bulk of the weight of the altar to protect his torso and head, likely more roots."
0,There was something else Byurk sensed through the stone.
0,Something long and thin stretched just beneath the altar platform towards the embankment.
0,“Get away from the embankment!”
0,Thick briers shot out of the soft soil and ensnared the two mages.
0,"They wrapped tight around their arms, legs, and neck, shredding the light leather armor and flesh."
0,"Two awaiting swordsmen rushed to the mages’ aid, but one of them was quickly ensnared as well."
0,He needed to separate Tyree from the pole in her right hand.
0,Byurk channeled his ven through the moisture in the air until it condensed just in front of Tyree.
0,He conjured an enormous volume of water and expelled it as a geyser facing the stream and rocky cliffside behind her.
0,The two swordsmen backed away to avoid the high-pressure attack.
0,Tyree impaled her left pole into the stone to help hold her in place.
0,Roots gathered and bound her hands to support her grip.
0,Byurk’s ven was draining quickly due to the sheer volume of water he was conjuring.
0,"He did not doubt that Tyree had more to spare, and despite her struggle against the torrent, the vines continued shredding deep and messy cuts into three of his men at the embankment."
0,At least Tyree was distracted enough to prevent her from ensnaring those trying to free them.
0,One brave swordsman dove beneath the geyser and thrust his sword into Tyree’s stomach.
0,"While not fatal to a dryad, it would weaken her as her life sap drained."
0,"The force of the geyser caught him and sent him tumbling over the crumbled altar into the ravine’s stream, but he crawled out alive albeit heavily battered."
0,Three of Byurk’s men were ensnared and probably mortally wounded.
0,Another was heavily damaged from Byurk’s own attack.
0,Byurk could not keep the geyser active for much longer.
0,"With only swordsmen remaining, once his ven ran out, they had no hope of defeating Tyree."
0,"He had learned that the older the dryad, the more powerful she became."
0,Tyree was not bluffing when she proclaimed she could kill him and all his men.
0,"While keeping focus on the hand channeling ven to fuel the geyser, Byurk ran across the surface of the spring to the waterfall."
0,"He placed his free hand on the stone and channeled most of his remaining ven through the rocky cliff, spring, and waterfall."
0,The waterfall ceased and the spring began to drain.
0,"The rocky face creaked from pressure, and when Byurk could no longer hold it back, he cut off the geyser."
0,All the water he built up in the rock face exploded with the aid of earth magic.
0,"The entire cliff face blew out as boulders, large stones, and mud rained upon the crumbled alter."
0,The heavy earth buried Tyree and the otherworlder.
0,Byurk ran back across the now shallow spring to the altar platform.
0,He jumped and pounded his fists into the stone when he landed.
0,The entire platform sank two feet.
0,"He repeated, shredding the skin on his knuckles."
0,"After a third strike, the platform fell beneath the water table and quickly filled with water."
0,"After the fourth, what once would have been the crumbled alter was now submerged."
0,"Byurk knew little about a dryad’s constitution, but the water-soaked earth would both crush and suffocate the otherworlder."
0,"Byurk’s neck was just above the water, and he lacked the ven to walk across it."
0,The muddy water stung his bleeding hands.
0,"His body shook, and he could barely climb up to the stony bank of the stream."
0,"Two of his soldiers reached down and grabbed his arms, yanking him up with pure admiration in their eyes."
0,What they just witnessed was no small feat of magic.
0,Byurk looked back at his desperate attack.
0,The entire waterfall and cliff face was no more.
0,The spring that fed the waterfall trickled through the crumbling stone.
0,The stream of the ravine that also fed the pool continued filling the large depression Byurk made as it worked its way around the earthen mound.
0,"The soldier who got caught in his geyser was buried along with the dryad and otherworlder, and Byurk’s heart ached for the valiant young life he extinguished."
0,"The three soldiers who were ensnared had been freed, but as he expected, the briers that bound their necks had cut them to the bone."
0,They were lost.
0,"Nine elite soldiers versus a single elder dryad in favorable conditions for him and his soldiers, and this was the result."
0,"As powerful as that dryad was, a single otherworlder eliminated most of his taskforce in a single attack, not just a few of his men over the course of a fight like with what happened here."
0,The loss of his men was a necessary sacrifice to kill an otherworlder.
0,They had no time to mourn the fallen.
0,Death was a part of war.
0,“Are you fit to travel?” 
0,Byurk’s five swordsmen stared at him with steeled faces.
0,“Good.
0,We leave for Vallen.”
0,"Chapter 5
“The Otherworlder”
Tyree"
1,Tyree’s lips pressed firmly against Justin’s.
0,Water seeped into the soil and rock quickly with the sudden dropping of the altar platform.
0,"If he did not receive air, he would drown."
0,"The roots of Tyree’s conduit supported the heaviest of the boulders, but the pressure of the ever-thickening mud was unbearable."
0,"Inhaling was difficult, and unless she resisted the crushing pressure on her lungs, the force of her exhale could also harm him."
0,"Dryads breathed what other species exhaled, and other species breathed what dryads exhaled."
0,This was known to dryads but unknown to most others.
0,"So long as they breathed into each other, they could survive, but this was not a permanent solution."
0,"Without sunlight, Tyree’s breaths would grow weaker, and while dryads could survive long without breathing, humans could not."
0,She needed to do something before then.
0,She needed to rescue this man and return him to Ceil.
0,"If not, Ceil could flee the battle and the war would not end."
0,"If the war did not end, the false hamadryad would remain and divide Dhuillir."
0,"Although she tried to rally the village against her, Tyree knew that without fire, the strength of an entire village could not kill a hamadryad if the hamadryad did not desire death, and fire could not be brought unless there were none who were under the hamadryad’s influence that could protect her."
0,"The hamadryad’s promise to die when the war ended was Dhuillir’s only hope, and a swift end depended on this man’s survival."
0,"Still, Justin’s chances were bleak."
0,Tyree gripped the conduit tight.
0,"Little life remained in the pole, and she did not know the location of the second."
0,She released it to quickly cover the man.
0,It had to be close.
0,"She had only used it to defend herself, so its remaining life should be much higher than the one she held."
0,"If she used all the remaining life of the conduit she still grasped, the roots binding the boulders together and supporting their weight would grow brittle."
0,"If the roots broke, they would both be crushed almost instantly."
0,"If she could not find the other pole, her hope for escape was gone."
0,"After waiting as long as she dared for Byurk to depart, Tyree sent a single thin shoot up through the rubble to sprout out the top of the pile and grow a large leaf, a beacon for help."
0,She then spread out roots from her pole to search the surface of the altar platform for the second staff.
0,Each root spread and branched into two or three more roots.
0,"The life remaining in the rod grew low, and when the heavy soil shifted from the weakening roots, she stopped."
0,She could no longer use the rod for fear of collapse.
0,She did not find the second rod.
0,The cascading rocks and soil must have knocked it further away.
0,She had no more options.
0,"The pressure grew into a dull ache, and she knew the human would be in far more pain."
0,Her breaths became short as claustrophobia set in.
0,"Panic spread through every thought and emotion, and were it not for the heavy pressure assaulting her from every angle, her body would be shivering uncontrollably."
0,Only the man under her arm and the feeling on her lips kept her mind from breaking.
0,She kept breathing through the muffled cries she made with every exhale.
0,Tyree had lived a long life.
0,She had mothered two wonderful daughters who were the pride of her life.
0,She knew there was a possibility of death when she agreed to join Ceil’s companion in captivity.
0,She was prepared for death when she stood against the false hamadryad’s authority to try and convince the villagers.
0,She was ready for death when she stood against Byurk to protect Justin.
0,"But, she was not prepared to be buried alive, slowly crushed to death."
0,"All dryads had a natural fear of being underground, away from sunlight, and that fear only worsened when it came to being buried."
0,"The weight of the boulders shifted again, adding more pressure."
0,Tyree’s cry became a scream.
0,"The boulder’s shifted again, and the weight of one crushed her wrist holding the rod."
0,"When they shifted again, she could no longer feel her hand, and her ven no longer flowed to it."
0,"The boulders shifted, and Tyree’s cries ceased."
0,This was how she would die.
1,"The altar platform tremored beneath her, and the pressure lessened."
0,"After a second tremor and further shifting of the rocks and boulders, the pressure grew bearable."
0,"Gradually, Tyree could move in the thick mud."
0,Something reached in and touched her back.
0,"Another pair of hands dug into the mud and wrapped around her waist to hoist her up, but Tyree clung to the human beneath her with her arm."
0,"If she separated from him, the mud could enter his lungs."
0,"More hands reached in, found Justin, and hoisted them both out together."
0,Mud filled Tyree’s eyes when she opened them.
0,"It stung, but there was light."
0,"A hand wiped her face and eyes, and she saw a Melian crouching in front of her."
0,Justin was draped across another’s knees as a Melian emptied his mouth of mud and water.
0,Tyree reached across and touched the young girl’s chest and then cheek to assure herself the girl was real.
0,"She wrapped her arm around the girl and drew her in, burying her face into her neck."
0,Tyree sat against one of the boulders that were cast aside.
0,"Her right hand was gone, having been severed at the wrist."
0,"Her left leg was broken but slowly mending; however, her right leg was crushed from just above her knee down to her foot."
0,The severity of the damage was unhealable.
0,"She would need to amputate it and let it regrow like her hand, and that would take a season or two."
0,Justin fared better.
0,He was breathing.
0,"A little water entered his lungs, most of it from her breath and saliva."
0,His left leg had a mild fracture.
0,The worst of the damage was his left arm.
0,It broke in three places under the weight of the altar.
0,"“What happened here,” the young girl asked."
0,"Although she was young, not yet fifty years old by appearance, she was still the eldest of the four Melians."
0,"The three soldiers Tyree ensnared were lined up beside the embankment, and the final soldier had been unburied and was being dragged by two of the Melians to the embankment next to them."
0,"Without a source of air, he was not as lucky."
0,"“This man is important to the war,” Tyree explained, looking at Justin in the final Melian’s care."
0,“These soldiers tried to kill him.
0,I must bring him to Vallen.”
0,"“I have done what I can aside from his arm, but he is not recovering,” the young shaman announced."
0,Justin was ill with ven poisoning and needed immediate treatment.
0,"After enduring the avalanche, he would be considerably weakened, and the poison could kill him at any time."
0,“Where is your village?
0,I need your help.”
0,Three of the girls were needed to carry Justin due to his weight.
0,They climbed up the destroyed waterfall to the ridge above and continued through the forest.
0,"Tyree hung her arm around Tae’s shoulder, the eldest girl, striking a mild conversation as they walked."
0,The girls had heard the avalanche from a distance and came to investigate out of curiosity and boredom.
0,"When they saw the large leaf atop the fresh pile of stone and soil, they knew a dryad lay buried underneath."
1,"The village was rather close, but what surprised Tyree was its size."
0,The small clearing in the forest surrounded a rocky outcrop with a single small tree growing on top.
0,The villagers either sat around the tree or against the outcrop weaving grass and leaves together or singing quietly.
0,There were no elderly or young children.
0,"The youngest girl had many hemma dotting her hair, but some of the petals fell while Tyree watched."
0,"Some of the flowers were wilting, a sign that she had recently given birth, but because there was no child, her daughter may have been stillborn or died as an infant."
0,"The other girls were between twenty to one hundred years of age, and there were only fifteen of them, or probably sixteen."
0,"This was a new village, and villages were usually seeded with twenty young dryads, at least in Melia."
0,This was terrible news.
0,"Tyree expected that at least fifty dryads would be needed to restore enough of Justin’s ven, but twenty was better than none."
0,She would need to keep close watch on him to make sure he lived long enough for his ven to naturally replenish.
0,"Tae set Tyree down at the base of the outcrop, and the three who carried Justin laid him down beside her."
0,The girl nimbly hopped up the outcrop to the eldest appearing Melian and explained the situation.
0,Tyree rubbed the aching stubs of her leg and wrist while she waited.
0,"The woman, rather young for a matriarch, jumped off the outcrop and rolled on the ground when she landed."
0,"She twitched and shook her ankle lightly, probably having sprained it in the landing, and trotted over to Tyree with a smile."
0,"“I am Preelen, the matriarch of this village."
0,I heard you need our ven.”
0,Preelen squatted down and prodded the man’s chest with her finger.
0,“I do.
0,"This man has ven poisoning, so I must replace it."
0,"His capacity puts all elfkind to shame, and your village may not be enough, but I have no other choice.”"
0,"Preelen grabbed the man’s broken arm, skillfully aligned the broken bones, and forcefully locked them together."
0,"The grind of bone on bone was almost audible, and the pain would have been unbearable if he was awake."
0,"She then scooted back and leaned down, pressing her forehead against his."
0,Immediately she pulled away and fell on her back.
0,“You weren’t joking!
0,Is he even human?”
0,"“Sorry, but we do not have time."
0,"He is so weak that if we do not act, the poison could kill him.”"
0,Preelen stood and waved to her small village.
0,“You heard her!”
0,"None of the other girls jumped off the embankment, choosing instead to climb down."
0,"Those who sat at the base of the embankment walked over, some of them quizzically admiring the dirty man."
0,“Mind if I do it?” Preelen asked.
0,“You are not in fair condition yourself.”
0,"“That would be much appreciated,” Tyree said."
0,"“I will try to stabilize him until you can replace his ven, otherwise he might die once his ven is gone.”"
0,“That would be reassuring.
0,"Let’s do this,” Preelen called to her village."
0,The girl’s gathered behind their matriarch and placed their hands on her back and arms where able.
0,Preelen leaned down and placed her forehead against the man’s and held his shoulders with her hands in case he writhed.
0,"Tyree dug her hand under his soaked and muddy shirt, cleared away the dirt, and rested her hand on his stomach."
0,Preelen took a deep breath.
0,“I’m starting.”
0,The man tensed up but did not writhe or wake.
0,"His weak pulse grew erratic, and for a moment, his heart stopped."
0,"Tyree jolted it to activity again and regulated it to the best of her ability, but the body quickly grew cold."
0,"His ven was gone, and Tyree could almost taste the sheer volume of stagnant ven permeating the air."
0,"Some of the girls sensed it too and grew uncomfortable, a few of them even shaking."
0,"Toxic ven would normally dissipate quickly into the natural ven present in the air, but his capacity was so massive that it forced away all the natural ven in the vicinity like a puff of thick smoke."
0,"The body relaxed, and if Tyree did not have a keen sense of his vitals, she would have thought him dead."
0,Soon warmth returned to his body and the matriarch separated from him.
0,"“We were only about a single berry to a basket, but that’s all we could give.” She leaned back and sighed, shivering faintly from ven exhaustion."
0,"“I thought I was going to be sick,” one of the younger girls remarked."
0,“What was that?”
0,“I absorbed some of it.” 
0,“Me too.” 
0,A few of the girls winced lightly as they purged the toxic ven from their bodies.
0,"“You should have shut off your regeneration,” Preelen jeered with a smile as she lay back onto the sparsely grassy dirt."
0,“I didn’t think it would be that much.”
0,"“Thank you,” Tyree said with a bow."
0,“He’s not out of the shade yet.
0,We’ll watch him while you rest and take care of yourself.
0,"When my ven returns, I will finish mending his arm.”"
0,“His leg is fractured as well.”
0,“And that.” 
0,“Thank you.” Tyree bowed again to the young village.
1,"* * *
Tyree sat against the small tree atop the outcrop to bask in as much sun as possible."
0,"It was now setting below the surrounding hills, its low angle allowing the rays of light to avoid the canopy above her and bathe her in its glow."
0,A large shadow slowly crept towards her from the hills.
0,"Once the sun set, she would need to change from sunbathing to meditation."
0,She snacked on roots and herb sprigs the village provided to help expedite her recovery.
0,"A lot of nutrients were needed to regrow limbs, but even with plentiful nutrients, the process would take far longer than she had time to wait."
0,"She needed to find a way to take Justin to Vallen, and with only one leg and hand, she could not do it alone."
0,“Feeling better?” 
0,Preelen hopped up the edge of the outcrop and sat against the tree with her shoulder touching Tyree’s.
0,"“Yes, thanks to you.”"
0,Preelen placed her hand on the ground to grow the grass.
0,"After breaking off a few blades, she began weaving them as she spoke."
0,"“So, who is he and who were those soldiers I assume you killed?"
0,I doubt many dryads would go through such lengths to save just any man.”
0,Her voice was less jovial than when Tyree arrived.
0,She was now acting the part of the village matriarch.
0,"She aided Tyree without question, but now she demanded the explanation."
0,"“He is a companion of Lady Ceil, widow of the late Emperor Yuro."
0,He is a human from another world who has agreed to aid her in this conflict.”
0,“Another world?
0,"I guess that would explain why he is so different, even for a human."
0,"His ven, body density, and all that.”"
0,Tyree was glad Preelen did not question the most unbelievable part of her explanation.
0,“Lady Ceil currently travels to Vallen to join the fairies’ last stand against Tolmyur.
0,"She agreed to the battle in exchange for his safe return, but afterwards the commander chose instead to kill him.”"
0,"Preelen set down her small, tightly woven bowl."
0,“And that is why you protected him.
0,"If I understand correctly, with that man here, Lady Ceil has no reason to join a hopeless battle?"
0,Do you know what road she travels?
0,I can send a few messengers after her.
0,It would be best that our empress not die so pointlessly.”
0,"Judging by Preelen’s reply, she had not received any messengers from Melians supporting either Byurk or Ceil nor had she been informed of the false Grandmatriarch and that Ceil betrayed Dhuillir."
0,This was understandable for a new village.
0,Other villages would not know its location until it sent out its own messengers.
0,Village locations were never planned beforehand--the dryads who leave to seed a new village travel until they find a suitable location.
0,They would also not have aligned under the false Grandmatriarch until a messenger reached their village that was under her influence and could convert them.
0,"With this good fortune, Tyree could act without the Hamadryad knowing."
0,"“These humans from another world are powerful, and Lady Ceil hopes to use them to turn the tide of the conflict in Vallen."
0,I do not believe she would abandon her cause or deny the fairies the aid of these powerful individuals.
0,She needs this man’s power.
0,I must bring him to Vallen.”
0,"“He was a prisoner, right?"
0,"If he is a strong as you claim, I can see why the soldiers tried to kill him while he was weakened by ven poisoning, but part of your story is still lacking."
0,"As strong as a single individual can be, I find it hard to believe that he could turn the tide of the war."
0,I doubt our empress would be so foolish as to go to war relying on a single man for victory.
0,I also doubt she would agree to go to war solely for the return of this man unless he had some other major significance.
0,A lover perhaps?
0,Or maybe he is a prominent political or military figure from his world?” 
0,Preelen rolled to her side and straddled Tyree with her arms.
0,She looked up into Tyree’s eyes with a regal maturity unfitting for her age.
0,"Only now did Tyree realize this woman was like her, far older than her visible age suggested."
0,Bearing children aged a dryad quickly.
0,Perhaps she only had a single daughter or was one of the rare few who passed through her years as an anthousai without ever bearing a child until her excessive blossoms naturally wilted and fell.
0,"“I ask again,” Preelen said with her unbroken gaze."
0,“Who is he?”
0,"Tyree never gave in to intimidation, but the focused stare of the matriarch made her uncomfortable."
0,She needed this village’s help.
0,What could she say to convince her?
0,“Preelen!
0,He’s awake!” one of the girls called from the base of the outcrop.
0,“I suppose I can ask him myself.” 
0,"Preelen pushed to her feet, and after a short running start, jumped off the outcropping."
0,Tyree heard a thud from the bottom and a weak moan.
0,"“You should stop doing that,” one of the girls at the bottom sighed."
0,Tyree used the trunk of the tree to help pull her to her foot.
0,"She hopped to the edge, sat down, and slowly descended."
1,"Preelen squatted in front of Justin while he sat, his weary eyes flitting between the Melians gawking at him."
0,Perhaps they had never seen a human before; most of them may have never even seen a male.
0,Tyree joined the gathering and sat on her one leg.
0,"Justin looked at her, recognizing her from the fleeting moments he regained consciousness."
0,"Now that Tyree saw him so attentive, she realized that all this time from the moment Ceil brought him to her village, the reason he never seemed to recover was due to the amount of toxic ven in his body."
0,"Had she learned of his condition earlier, she could have cured him there in the central village or even at her own village."
0,"Perhaps the events of that night would have gone differently or never happened at all, and the hamadryad would have never taken root."
0,“What is your name?” Preelen asked in Elven.
0,"“Justin Hapfeld,” Justin replied, his eyes shifting, unsure where to look."
0,"Slowly, his face grew flushed."
0,“Who are you?
0,Where are you from?” Preelen asked next.
0,“Sorry.
0,Not… I not… speak well.”
0,"Preelen turned to Tyree, frustrated."
0,“Are we even going to be able to communicate like this?
0,How was he companions with Lady Ceil if he doesn’t speak Elven?”
0,“Lady Ceil is fluent in his native tongue.
0,She never spoke to them in Elven.”
0,“That helps us little…” 
0,Preelen sat cross-legged and folded her arms.
0,Justin looked around and then behind him.
0,“Where Sammy?
0,Where Chloe?”
0,“And they are?” Preelen asked.
0,"“Humans from his world,” Tyree explained."
0,“They should be with Ceil on their way to Vallen.”
0,“Minum…?” Justin asked.
0,“The minum is gone.
0,"Minum not here,” Tyree assured Justin, hoping he would understand."
0,“Captain Byurk.
0,"He was the commander who made the agreement with Lady Ceil and then ordered this man’s death,” she explained to Preelen."
0,Justin grabbed Preelen’s shoulder and pulled her to the side.
0,A large stone half the size of her head flew by her ear and bounced in the gap between her and the other Melians.
0,The girls jumped out of the way as it continued bouncing and rolling down the shallow hill.
0,“Sorry!” One of the younger village girls climbing down the outcrop to join the rest of the village had slipped and dislodged the large stone.
0,She ran to the group.
0,“Did it hit anyone?”
0,"“No,” Preelen replied, her eyes as wide as the stone that nearly crushed her head."
0,Justin’s reaction speed was unnatural.
0,“That feeling…” She stared at Justin who was wincing in pain from applying pressure to his fractured leg.
0,"The bone was mended, but there was other tissue damage that was left to heal naturally."
0,"“He is a time mage,” Tyree explained."
0,“Without channel time?” Preelen laughed faintly to herself.
0,“Now it all makes sense!
0,"Tyree, I believe your story.” "
0,She stood and addressed her village as their matriarch.
0,"“Those of you who are curious about humans or men, take him down to the stream and bathe him."
0,"Everyone else, prepare for departure.”"
0,All but three of the eldest villagers lifted Justin and carried him down the hill amid his confusion and deeply flushed face.
0,“Does this mean you will help me take him to Vallen?” Tyree asked.
0,“It certainly does.
0,We only just arrived here in mid-winter.
0,That rock that nearly hit me was not the first to break off the outcrop.
0,That’s why I jump down instead of climb.
0,"I’ve been thinking this is a poor place for a village, especially when we start bearing children."
0,Too dangerous.
0,"I mean, we could cover the outcrop with vines and roots and such, as many villages do, but this gives us an opportunity to find somewhere better."
0,"If our travels just happen to take us into Vallen in search of a new home, so be it,” Preelen smirked."
0,"Chapter 6
“Nalain”
Sammy"
1,"Beyond the rolling, rocky Mailan Hills of northern Melia, the forests grew sparse."
0,"Flatlands covered in forests marbled together with lush, grassy fields stretched almost as far as the horizon."
0,"In the distance, the snowcapped mountains of the Nuanae Range of the wilderlands, the northern border of the Amelian Empire, seemed to grow like a wall out of the verdant expanse."
0,"Southeastern Vallen was densely forested and heavily populated, so many people believed that fairies only lived in forests, but as close kin to the High Elves--once called Grassland Elves long ago--fairies were just as at home on the plains."
0,"Stone ruins of an ancient civilization stood like obelisks across the flatlands, and the largest ruins were repurposed into fairy cities."
0,"As Ceil explained it to Sammy, the location they were headed to first was one such city."
0,Sammy examined a strange stone structure sinking into the forest floor.
0,"The stone was intricately carved, but the weathering of time had made what she believed was originally a smooth texture quite porous and rough."
0,Moss and other small-rooted plants clung to the stone using the abrasive surface as a hold.
0,"The most peculiar aspect of the structure was that it appeared to be a pointed archway that had tilted about 30 degrees and sunk ten feet into the ground, but there were no other ruins anywhere in sight that could explain the purpose for the archway."
0,Her only guess was that the rest of the ruins were buried far deeper underground.
0,This place was an archeologist’s dream.
0,“Sammy!
0,This way!
0,I found some!” 
0,Lemi waved her hand in wide arcs almost out of sight.
0,"The sun had only just risen, and they were tasked with scavenging herbs for breakfast and possibly hunting game if they saw any."
0,"Lemi’s skill with the bow was impressive, but her constant shouting would have driven any potential game away."
0,Sammy smiled while shaking her head.
0,Hopefully Coby had better luck.
0,"“Sammy, it’s amazing!"
0,There’s so much fedaj here!”
0,"Lemi brandished a thick stalk of a white, feathered mushroom when Sammy approached."
0,"Fedaj, literally “first feather” in Elven and named after the soft down of infant birds according to Lemi, was rare in Melia but appeared to be far more common in Vallen."
0,"It was toxic until cooked thoroughly, but Lemi was able to extract the toxins with life magic to make it edible raw."
0,"Raw was preferable, because the fine feathers burnt off in fire or disintegrated when boiled."
0,"When eaten, the feathers melted like cotton candy in the mouth and had a savory, mildly salty flavor."
0,"Sammy sat her pack down and held it open while Lemi quickly uprooted mushroom after mushroom, only leaving two behind."
0,"“We have to make sure it can come back,” Lemi explained for the fourth time that morning."
0,She sprung to her feet and pranced off further into the forest with the small beads of her dava clacking lightly with each step.
0,"Lemi lived in the forest, so she was skilled at identifying forest herbs."
0,"Whenever they camped in or near a forest, foraging became Lemi’s job, and she always requested that Sammy join her."
0,"Having someone she could speak to in Melian gave her no shortage of joy, and Sammy enjoyed Lemi’s carefree, childlike attitude because it helped distract her from her worries about Justin and the war."
0,"Ceil was raised on the plains before she entered the palace, so she was far more knowledgeable about the edible plants that could be found in the grasslands."
0,Her scavenging duty came when they camped on the plains.
0,"To balance out Lemi’s constant requests for Sammy, Chloe always joined Ceil at Lemi’s request."
0,Lemi was quite adamant about the pairings.
0,"Coby on the other hand hunted whenever he craved meat, so their dried meat supply relied almost solely on his whims."
0,Sammy lifted the sack and swung it over her back.
0,"It was growing full quickly, but they would still eat most if not all their haul, especially Chloe."
0,"The food of Whinhlem had very little substance to it, including meat."
0,"Vegetables and plants were light and airy, and meat was never very dense, but it was quite succulent."
0,"Sammy thought the light and juicy meat of the weasel-like musdel in Fiorrae was unique to that creature, but most game they hunted turned out the same; it shriveled up to nothing if overcooked."
0,Sammy assumed this was due to all flora and fauna evolving to survive on a planet with such high gravity.
0,Lemi retrieved the sack from Sammy on their way back to the camp.
0,She swung it in wide circles as she pranced through the forest.
0,“Careful.
0,"You are going to crush the fedaj,” Sammy warned, but Lemi paid little mind."
1,"Back at the camp, Chloe was stoking the fire while Ceil inspected Debin’s map."
0,"“The sack’s pretty full,” Chloe exclaimed in excitement."
0,"“Yah, we can actually have a decent breakfast for once,” Sammy replied."
0,Ceil set the map down and glared at Sammy and Lemi.
0,"The closer they came to Nalain, the worse her temper grew."
0,"“I could hear Lemi’s shouts from here,” she chastised in Elven so that Lemi could understand."
0,“You do realize that we are in enemy territory.
0,What would happen if the army found us before we reach a city?”
0,“We couldn’t see any army or smoke from the hills.
0,You said it yourself.
0,They might not have gotten this far yet.” Sammy placed an understanding hand on Lemi’s shoulder.
0,"She did not want the girl growing melancholy, for both their sakes."
0,“But that still means they could be coming.”
0,“Coby is in the air.
0,He would warn us long before any soldiers arrive.”
0,“That still does not help us if there is a scout hiding in the fore-- Wha!” 
0,An animal dropped from the sky in front of Ceil.
0,"“I said we do not need anything this big!” Ceil shouted to the large blue hawk circling above, completely ignoring her previous chastisement of Lemi for doing the same."
0,"Coby gave a triumphant cry, proud of his catch."
0,"The animal looked like a spotted deer, but its feet had two distinct hoofed toes."
0,"Its ears were long and could hang almost to the ground if it stood, and it had a goatee-like beard, so perhaps it was more of a goat than a deer."
0,"It was similar in size to Ceil, so she understood why Ceil would be mad."
0,Cleaning and drying all that meat would delay their departure.
0,"“Chloe, you have a job now.” "
0,Ceil pushed the responsibility of gutting and cleaning the kill to Chloe.
0,"Sammy could not use drying magic, so they had to rely on Chloe’s heat."
0,"At least they had plenty of food to make up for the cost of Chloe’s fire ven conversion, and Sammy was happy to have some meat."
0,Coby ate the scraps of Chloe’s unskilled and sloppy butchering while Lemi prepared the herbs and mushrooms that could be eaten raw.
0,Sammy cooked the rest.
0,"All the while, Ceil remained glued to the map."
0,"Sammy thought that Ceil would have had it memorized by now, but Ceil continually spent all her free time staring at it, her face growing sullener with each passing day."
0,Sammy placed her hand on the map to pull Ceil away from whatever burdened her mind.
0,"“It’s ready,” she said in the most reassuring tone she could, although she was unsure of what she was assuring."
0,"Breakfast finished quickly, and Ceil returned to her map."
0,Sammy aided Chloe with the butchering and drying of the deer-goat that neither Ceil nor Lemi knew the name of.
0,"Sammy had eaten plenty of goat cheese and venison in the past, and the meat of the peculiar mammal was almost a perfect middle ground between the earthy yet sour flavor of goat cheese and the hearty game flavor of venison, so she felt the description was not far off."
0,Maybe it had nothing to do with goats and was just a sour deer?
0,She did feel that the sour smell from butchering it would not get off her hands no matter how much she washed them.
0,"“I think it’s a goat,” Chloe decided after Sammy explained her descriptory conundrum while they picked up camp."
0,“It sure smelled like one.”
0,"They had enough dried meat for a few days now, and Lemi was more than willing to carry the extra weight, but it might not be needed."
0,They would reach Nalain at midday by Ceil’s estimates.
1,"* * *
Late into the morning, Coby dove down through the canopy in front of Ceil who led the party."
0,He bellowed a reverberating cry and flapped his wings as if to keep everyone back.
0,"“What did he say?” Ceil asked Sammy, her face seeped in worry."
0,"“He’s warning us,” Sammy answered."
0,“He did not see any danger but wants us to be careful from here.”
0,“Can you really understand him that well?
0,From a single cry?” Chloe asked.
0,"“It’s more of a feeling, but yah."
0,"I can’t get any specific details, though.”"
0,"Following Coby’s warning, Lemi took point after handing her sack of provisions to Ceil and her noisy dava to Sammy."
0,"She moved ahead into the forest with impossibly silent steps, bow in hand."
0,"Once again, Sammy was glad Lemi came with them, and no doubt Ceil was grateful too."
0,"Once Sammy saw the light at the border of the forest, Lemi returned with ill news."
0,“The armies were here.”
0,"Everyone picked up pace and ran out of the forest to the edge of the field, or what was once a field."
0,It was trampled flat by an unknown number of boots.
0,"The grass lay torn and wilting, dried by the winter sun."
0,"“They passed through two, maybe three days ago,” Lemi guessed after touching the trodden grass, assessing the level of recovery of the broken blades."
0,“But we never saw any sign of them.
0,"An army can’t move that fast, can it?” Sammy asked."
0,“We came from the southeast.
0,They must have marched from the northeast.
0,There is a small village there called Henem a little less than a day’s walk away.” 
0,Ceil gripped the rolled map in her hand with white knuckles.
0,"As Sammy suspected, Ceil had the map memorized."
0,“They are not just targeting the major cities.
0,This is genocide.”
0,"Ceil ran through the trampled field, and only once Sammy looked in the direction Ceil headed did she see the destination."
0,An ancient stone tower stood like a beacon above the forest canopy.
0,"It was the marker of Nalain, a city built upon ancient ruins."
0,"No smoke rose into the sky, so Sammy prayed that the city was safe, but if the armies had already passed through, she knew it was a fool’s hope."
0,She chased after Ceil with Coby flying further ahead.
1,"Instead of traveling through the forest, Ceil circled the forest line."
0,"They found the first body only a few minutes later, a Tolmyur soldier in thin plate mail with his face crushed in by a pointed but blunt object."
0,"The closer they approached the city, the more bodies they found, all Tolmyur soldiers."
0,The sight of death attacked Sammy’s memories.
0,"Visions of the hospital flashed in her mind and with them, a resurgence of the dread she felt."
0,"Her chest burned, and tears filled her eyes, but she couldn’t fall too far behind, so she kept moving."
0,Ceil stopped when the field bent around the forest towards the tower.
0,"Lemi stood with her, and Chloe was the next to catch up."
0,"Sammy nearly tripped over a body but pushed through the exhaustion, part physical but mostly mental."
0,"What she saw in the distance dropped her to her knees, and the welling tears fell."
0,It was a ruin of ruins.
0,The devastation of battle spread before them in the open field before the ruins of Nalain.
0,"Broken weapons rose like graves from the ground, marking the many bodies of both humans and fairies alike."
0,"The ancient walls of Nalain stood as a powerful defense, and the fairies placed their hope in that defense to turn back the tide of genocide, but that hope was ruthlessly destroyed one by one with each fairy body Sammy passed on their silent march to the crumbling walls."
0,"They looked to her as small elves, almost like children, and each one made Sammy’s heart ache to bursting."
0,"As they approached the walls, the number of Tolmyur bodies decreased, and the number of fairies and elves increased until not a single Tolmyur soldier could be found."
0,This was the moment the Tolmyur army’s numbers overwhelmed them.
0,"Coby perched on the wall like a sentinel, and his mourning cry warned Sammy not to enter the city."
0,She stopped before the broken and crumbling defense and watched Ceil and Lemi climb the bloodstained rubble with pained faces.
0,She could not call them back.
0,Her voice would not sound.
0,"There was no danger in Coby’s warning, but there was something he did not wish her to see."
0,"Chloe grasped Sammy’s hand gently, almost too hot to touch."
0,Sammy could not understand how Chloe was not crying.
0,She only smiled back and pulled Sammy to follow.
0,This was the war they were entering.
0,This was the death and destruction they would continue to witness.
0,"Perhaps, this was the devastation they would eventually cause."
0,Sammy recalled the night at the central Melian village.
0,She recalled the attack on the university.
0,"Chloe had already killed so many, and the pain of that realization made Sammy’s heart break."
0,"She dropped, and light sobs broke out of her once silent voice."
0,"“You don’t need to come,” Chloe whispered with a loving face full of maturity that Sammy felt she could never achieve."
0,"Sammy could not speak her answer, but she forced herself to stand and take a single step forward."
0,She placed her hand on the rubble near where another small hand protruded between two large stones.
0,"With Chloe’s help, she jumped up and continued climbing."
0,Lemi awaited her at the top and extended a trembling hand.
0,"The young girl, looking no older than a tall 13-year-old, was not crying, but the anguish in her face caused Sammy’s tears to flow anew."
0,Only Ceil’s face was hardened against the devastation.
1,"When Sammy saw the inner-city ruins, she realized now that she should not have brought such a young girl into this."
0,Such death was not something Lemi should see.
0,The stone structures were perfectly preserved with no wood in sight.
0,There was no smoke because there was little to burn.
0,"Large scorch marks showed the rampant use of fire, but stone would never light."
0,The only fuel for a flame was the countless dead that littered the ground so deep that the weathered stone was sparsely visible.
0,Their charred bodies gave no path to walk.
0,"Ceil walked across the bodies with no respect for the dead, soldier and civilian alike."
0,"The dead of the city outside the walls were the young and valiant, but those who held against the siege from within were the elderly, women, and children."
0,Even the children gripped their small knives in death.
0,Sammy’s heart and mind grew numb as she followed Ceil’s path over the bodies.
0,She wanted to turn back.
0,There was no purpose in being here.
0,The city was lost.
0,All were dead.
0,What drove Ceil forward?
1,She looked up from the death beneath her feet and saw four people standing at the end of the road in the center of a garden square.
0,"The closer they walked, the more Sammy shook with dread."
0,The four people were women.
0,"And, they were not standing."
0,Ceil ran to them and stopped at the border of the garden.
0,Each girl was a High Elf similar to Ceil in age.
0,They were impaled between their legs up through their mouths on wooden stakes.
0,"In the center between them on the soil died brown in their blood sat a large stone from the outer wall, and atop it lay the four severed tails of the impaled women."
0,This was a message for Ceil as if they knew she would come.
0,"Without a word or a crack in her stone expression, Ceil turned and walked away."
0,"“We can’t leave them like this,” Sammy screamed."
0,Ceil pounded her red cedar staff onto the stone road.
0,“They are dead.
0,What good could we do them now?”
0,“It’s too cruel…” Sammy cried.
0,"Death permeated the ruined city like a pungent cloud, but the treatment of these women for the sole crime of being similar to Ceil was unbearable."
0,“What would you have me do?” 
0,"Ceil did not turn to face Sammy, and her voice showed no emotion."
0,“I’ll burry them.”
0,Sammy walked over to one of the women and grabbed the stake at the base.
0,"Exerting all her strength, the stake came loose and fell to the side."
0,"Chloe and Lemi quickly helped, but Ceil never turned around."
0,"Sammy located a small shield and began digging, but Lemi quickly stopped her."
0,"She placed her hand on a nearby tree, and roots coiled on the ground, loosening the soil."
0,"The loose soil was easily scooped away, and the four High Elves were soon buried."
0,Sammy reached into her bag and removed a small satchel.
0,"She loosed the string and dumped the four white, tear-shaped berries into her hand."
0,"After poking a hole above each grave, a berry was dropped in and covered."
0,"I’m sorry, Sammy prayed in her heart to the deceased; not just the four women, but to the entire city."
0,"When Ceil heard Sammy approach, she walked forward, and they left the ruins of Nalain."
1,"* * *
That evening, they sat around a low fire in the middle of the densest section of forest they could find."
0,"Sammy prepared dinner using the meat they dried earlier that morning, but the thought of eating meat after seeing so much carnage made Sammy ill."
0,"“Nalain was one of the cities where the fairies planned to send me for my protection,” Ceil said, breaking her silence from the time they left the ruins."
0,She held the map in one hand and a charred twig in the other.
0,"“There is another city like Nalain but much larger, Revlan."
0,It was brought up in the discussion back then but was rejected because of its size.
0,They wanted to keep lives lost to a minimum if… if Tolmyur should ever attack it in search of me.
0,It is further west of here.
0,"That is our next destination,” Ceil announced as she tossed the twig into the small embers."
0,"“If the army was in Nalain three days ago, we should reach Revlan long before they do.”"
0,"From the corner of Sammy’s eye, she saw a tear fall onto the map."
0,"She immediately dropped the bag of provisions and grabbed Ceil’s shoulder, wrapping her arms around her."
0,"Ceil dropped the map and buried her face into Sammy’s chest, crying silently."
0,"The map on the ground showed eleven black X’s starting from Nalain moving east across every city, town, and village in northwestern Vallen."
0,"A single city to the west was circled, and between it and Nalain, one city and three villages were slashed with a single black stroke: locations they would abandon."
0,"Revlan was the westernmost city, and the map showed nothing beyond it."
0,"Chapter 7
“The Dryads’ Secret Weapon”
Kolbur"
1,The conscription of the dryads progressed relatively smoothly.
0,"The road to northwestern Vallen only traveled through the western provinces of Dhuillir, so in order to better bolster their army, General Bregon periodically set up camp for two to five days so that conscription forces could be broken off and sent into neighboring provinces to conscript any able-bodied dryads."
0,Their ultimatum was simple: “Join us in eradicating the invaders from another world or become food for our forces.” 
0,"Hostilities often arose at first, but after the slaughter of a few villages, the rest were quick to comply."
0,"The initial conflict in each province was even welcomed, because it meant an increase in provisions."
0,"General Bregon’s army had over doubled in size, and their reserves of food had tripled."
0,"At their current rate, Lieutenant Kolbur felt that they would be prepared for a prolonged siege if needed by the time they reached Vallen."
0,Kolbur’s optimism came from the success of his first conscription mission into the Simydia province.
0,"He and his 400 men had just returned with 2000 pale-green, almost white dryads and another 150 dryads worth of dried food."
0,"The other four groups sent to Simydia saw similar results, but from the discussion happening in front of him as he approached General Bregon to report during the closure of their fourth conscription camp, it seemed not every conscription force was successful."
0,“Is this the first rebellion?”
0,"“There was always some resistance, but the Fendamai are openly hostile.” "
0,“Did Captain Kremyur truly lose?
0,He had over a thousand strong under his command.”
0,"Another winded and sweating scout arrived, silencing the discussion."
0,“Lieutenant Passel and his army were eradicated.
0,The Dafnai knew he was coming and ambushed them.”
0,"Lieutenant Passel only had a small platoon of 200, but including the thousand under Kremyur, these were terrible losses, and the true battle in Vallen had yet to begin."
0,General Bregon noticed Kolbur and called him forward.
0,“Your report?”
0,Kolbur cleared his throat and hoped that his success could uplift the morale of the other Lieutenants and Captains present.
0,“Success in Simydia.
0,"We estimate an additional 7000 dryads from the five platoons, including 400 dryads for food.”"
0,"Simydia was the greatest success of the provinces so far, but General Bregon’s expression did not change."
0,“What of Captain Hekket?
0,Should he not be the one reporting?”
0,“Captain Hekket is the sole loss in Simydia.
0,"He fell due to his own hubris in the initial hostilities,” Kolbur explained honestly."
0,“I am the next senior commander.”
0,The truth was that Simydia would have submitted without a fight and was willing to aid the war effort.
0,"That insufferable minum captain chose instead to make an example of the first village, killing the young who were unable to be conscripted."
0,The village retaliated.
0,"Hekket was killed immediately with life magic, and the village was promptly eliminated with the fire mages on hand, but word spread that the soldiers could not be trusted, and only after the annihilation of three more villages did the Simydians submit once more."
0,"Conscripting 7000 was an incredible success, but Kolbur firmly believed that they could have doubled that number if they kept amiable relations with Simydia."
0,"“So Simydia is the last,” General Bregon mumbled."
0,“Last?” one of the captains asked.
0,"“From here on, we are entering provinces under the control of the hamadryad."
0,Conscription will end.
0,We must treat every dryad we see as a potential enemy to prevent further losses until we reach Vallen.”
0,“““Sir!””” 
0,"The captains and lieutenants dispersed, but Kolbur remained."
0,"“Sir, if I may,” Kolbur began."
0,“Speak.”
0,“I would like to take a larger detour than the neighboring provinces.
0,There is a species of dryad that is believed to be far more powerful than others.
0,"They are few in number, but they may be vital in giving us an advantage in this battle, especially with the strength of these otherworlders.”"
0,“You speak of the kissiae.
0,They are under our Commanding General’s protection and cannot be summoned.”
0,"“Pardon my disrespect, but if we lose this battle, we will lose Amel, correct?"
0,Should we not make use of every weapon at our disposal?
0,"If the kissiae are under Commanding General Jethro’s command, they should be easy to convince without the use of violence."
0,"If they are as powerful as the rumors say, none might be lost.”"
0,"General Bregon glared down at Kolbur, causing sweat to bead on Kolbur’s brow."
0,"He knew what he was asking of General Bregon, blatant insubordination."
0,"“You said you were the senior-most lieutenant under Captain Hekket, correct?”"
0,"“Yes, sir.” "
0,"“I promote you to captain, and with that promotion, there is classified information you must know.” "
0,General Bregon knelt down and hushed his reverberating voice to speak level with Kolbur.
0,"“The campaign in the other world has failed, and we do not know the status of our Commanding General other than that he is in trouble."
0,"We must act without him, and with that knowledge, I give you permission to conscript the kissiae.”"
0,"“Thank you, sir.” "
0,Kolbur’s chest thundered with a painful combination of fear and gratitude.
0,"The ill news was terrifying, but he felt strongly in his heart that the kissiae could tip the scale of this war in their favor."
0,“How many men do you require?”
0,“Not many.
0,"I am not visiting their lands in hostility, nor do I want to give that impression."
0,"Twenty fire mages for protection through the dryad provinces, ten archers, ten swordsmen, and two scouts."
0,One for forward and the second for observation to report back should something happen to us.”
0,“Granted.”

The Dhuillir wetlands of Elos lied beyond Simydia and its eastward neighbor, Velanidia."
0,"Kolbur avoided villages in Simydia when possible--he did not want to antagonize them further--but once they reached Velanidia, he would require a guide."
0,Elos was small and not a true province of Dhuillir.
0,"Without direction, they could wander beyond Velanidia without ever locating it."
0,"However, securing a guide was not without its own dangers."
0,Kolbur did not know the extent of the hamadryad’s influence.
0,"If the Velanids were hostile, he would have no choice but to follow the eastern border in hope of locating the wetlands."
0,"Even then he was only following rumors, and Elos may not even be near Velanidia."
0,"Velanidia was unlike any of the Dhuillir provinces Kolbur had seen, and he felt it difficult to call it a forest."
0,Rolling green fields spread before him like a verdant blanket laid out but not pulled taught.
0,Massive ancient oaks towered hundreds of feet into the sky with wide branches that could shade a small village.
0,"No other trees grew beneath them, and they were spread enough apart that their leaves did not touch those of another oak, or perhaps the branches could have touched but they grew with respect to the growth of their neighbors."
0,The forest grew as if the canopy was the ceiling and the trunks the large pillars to a grand natural hall.
0,The shaded fields devoid of any flora larger than small shrubbery gave a near perfect view of multiple Velanid villages.
0,"Likewise, standing on the border between Velanidia and Simydia, Kolbur and his small platoon were in full view of each nearby village."
0,"As he led his men forward onto the fields, three of the nearest villages gathered and approached."
0,"If the Velanids were hostile, there was nowhere they could hide, and they would have no choice but to flee and go around."
0,"Any violence would alert all of Velanidia, making passage impossible for his small party."
0,"“Do not draw your weapons, but be prepared to defend at the quickest sign of aggression,” Kolbur ordered."
0,The approaching dryads numbered about two hundred by Kolbur’s estimate.
0,"At one hundred yards distant, Kolbur halted his march, and the Velanids did likewise."
0,"Three representatives, one from each village, walked forward, and Kolbur alone advanced to meet them."
0,“I request passage through Velanidia and guidance to Elos.”
0,“A request and not a demand?” asked the eldest of the village representatives.
0,Her deep brown skin was cracked and brittle.
0,Splinters fell with every movement of her shaking feet.
0,"Her head was bald and void of the small, pointed, almost sharp oaken leaves of the Velanids."
0,“I have come seeking the aid of the Kissiae in these dire times.
0,We have received word that invaders from another world have arrived in Dhuillir and Vallen.
0,"They are powerful beyond reason, and without the strength to face them, we will not survive.”"
0,Hushed conversations rose among the Velanids.
0,The eldest matriarch closed her eyes and spoke as if for all the villages.
0,“The Venalids are not whom you must convince.
0,"We can direct you to the sanctuary, but we cannot enter with you."
0,"If what you say is true, they will know.”"
0,“We are grateful for your understanding.
0,The otherworlders have already attacked a village in Melia and have shown they are not an ally to the dryads.
0,"Upon our return, I also request that any able Velanids join us on our march to battle.”"
0,“Attacking a dryad village makes these otherworlders no different than you humans.
0,We know of your actions as you travel through Dhuillir.
0,"If you return from Elos with the kissiaes’ favor, perhaps we may reconsider,” the matriarch replied, turning her back and pointing to a much younger Velanid from her village."
0,"The woman sprinted for Kolbur, almost making him draw his blade by reflex, and then bowed deeply, her sharp hair sliding down and scraping at her shoulders and arms."
0,“I will guide you to Elos.”
1,Velanidia was one of the smaller provinces in Dhuillir.
0,"Instead of remote villages, the Velanids interacted almost as one united society under the canopy of the giant oaks."
0,Entire large gatherings--what one would expect to be a village in any other province--moved out of the way as Kolbur’s forces passed.
0,"Their animosity towards Tolmyur was palpable, but he was grateful that it was not severe enough to lead to confrontation."
0,The Velanids solely wanted nothing to do with them.
0,Kolbur’s forces reached the eastern border as the sun set below the canopy.
0,"Unlike the other provinces where a single species of tree dominated the flora of the region, the expansive forest before them contained many different species."
0,It did not appear to be wetlands or even a dryad-cultivated province of Dhuillir.
0,"“Is this Elos?” Kolbur asked, doubting his guide."
0,“Elos is further within.
0,"If you keep your current course and do not deviate, you will find it.”"
0,"“Then we will camp here and continue in the morning,” Kolbur called to his men."
0,"“Camping is not permitted,” the guide warned."
0,“You are not welcome in our lands.
0,"You requested passage through Velanidia, so pass you shall."
0,Make your request for shelter in Elos.
0,"If we see you camp near our borders, expect retribution."
0,"Your small band of soldiers cannot hope to defend against all of Velanidia.” The guide glared with rigid ire, and she bowed in false hospitality."
0,"Seeing such blatant defiance, some of the soldiers drew their weapons, and the mages brandished their flames."
0,Kolbur raised his hand to quell his soldiers’ tempers.
0,"“You have complied with our request, so we will continue on."
0,"I do not wish to see such majestic trees burn,” he replied, half in warning to the guide who was nothing more than a messenger for the heart of Velanidia."
0,"He wanted to teach the dryad her place, but his numbers were few, and they would have to pass through Velanidia once again if they wanted to return to the conscription camp in a timely manner."
0,General Bregon was holding the camp’s departure for this mission.
0,"He only had six days to return, and three had already been spent."
0,He turned his back to Velanidia and walked into the lush and diverse forest.
1,"* * *
The Velanid’s warning weighed on Kolbur’s mind."
0,How near to the border could they camp without the threatened retribution falling upon them?
0,"He did not know, so he made his soldiers march."
0,"The sunset had faded to darkness, and the dense forest let no light from the celestial bodies in the clear night sky pass through the canopy."
0,"If not for the fire mages, he and his soldiers would be unable to see their hand before their own faces."
0,"The underbrush was dense, entangled, and slowed their passage."
0,"There were no paths or game trails, almost as if the forest itself was a barrier protecting what lied within."
0,"“The men are tired,” Kolbur’s lieutenant reported."
0,"He was a robust young swordsman who, like Kolbur, had only just received his promotion."
0,“We should clear the brush and set up camp.”
0,"“No. I have no basis for this belief, but I feel that this dense forest is still what the Velanids call the border.”"
0,“Are you saying that we are still in Velanidia?” 
0,“Elos is not a province but a location within Dhuillir.
0,It would be wise to suspect as much.”
0,"“Sir, there is water ahead,” the forward scout announced."
0,"Due to the dense underbrush, he was unable to scout too far ahead, only staying within visibility of the light of the mages’ flames."
0,"Kolbur could hear the faint splash of each of the scout’s steps, and soon the chill of moisture surrounded his feet."
0,"The ground grew soft, but the underbrush did not thin."
0,Walking from here on would grow even more difficult.
0,The choice was his whether to turn back and clear ground to make camp or to press forward into what were likely the desired wetlands.
0,"“We move forward,” he ordered."
0,"The groundwater did not grow deep, only to the height of his ankles, but it covered the entirety of the forest floor and soaked into his boots with every step."
0,"The soft, muddy ground clung to his feet."
0,Trudging through mud after a full day’s march was more than his endurance could handle.
0,"The mages lacked the endurance of the swordsmen and archers, particularly the minums, but they followed without complaint."
0,There was nowhere to set up camp unless they wanted to sleep on the water.
0,He began to question his decision to continue the march.
0,"Even if dangerous, camping on dry ground in the dense forest would have been preferable."
1,"Another few hours passed, and Kolbur felt he would break."
0,"The gasps and groans of his men were a dismal chorus in the dark, but they were too deep to turn back for dry ground."
0,Where were they headed?
0,What was their destination?
0,"Elos was known as the wetlands of Dhuillir, and the forest they traveled was indeed wet."
0,It was drowned.
0,Had he reached Elos?
0,How could he know?
0,"If this was Elos, where were the Kissiae, and how could he find them?"
0,"All at once, the groundcover vanished, and the water level rose to midway up his shins or too his knees in some places."
0,"Next the trees vanished, yet there were no stars, and the moons did not give their light."
0,They reached a black marsh of perfectly still water that spread out into darkness that not even the flames on his mages’ hands could penetrate.
0,He continued the slow march deep into the darkness.
0,"A splash sounded in the dark, and a minute later, the ripples reached Kolbur’s legs."
0,“Gather together.
0,Form a defensive perimeter.”
0,"He did not know if there was any real danger or if his exhaustion was making him overcautious, but there was something odd about this place."
0,This marsh was unnatural.
0,"With swordsmen on the perimeter and mages and archers in the center, Kolbur led them deeper into the marsh."
0,A second splash sounded from the direction they had come and a third from the direction they were headed.
0,The archers drew their bows.
0,"Something was out there in the eternal darkness, and it wasn’t a kissiae."
0,"The ivy dryads were rumored to thrive in moist climates, but they were not wetland creatures."
0,They could not live in water.
0,"After a fourth splash so close that Kolbur caught the spray of water but could not see what caused it, he called out in desperation."
0,“We must speak with the kissiae!” 
0,"His heart thundered stronger than the exhaustion of his march, and his fear spread like a disease among his men."
0,"The splash was too large to be a fish, but the water was too shallow for it to be an animal of any large size, especially if it could disappear under the black water."
0,Kolbur saw the terror of his men’s faces in the fireglow.
0,He should not have come here at night.
0,A large splash sounded behind Kolbur where the third had been.
0,He turned around to see a woman.
0,"Her white silk gown, impossibly pristine in the murky water, was drenched and clung tight to her body, accentuating the curvature of her perfect figure."
0,"Her face, barely visible in the orange light of the flames, held an unnatural and ageless beauty impossible for any elf or human."
0,"When Kolbur noticed the color of her long hair--deep blue in the dark, but when it caught the light of the flames, it shimmered green--he knew what stood before him."
0,"She was a naiad, a water nymph."
0,"“Fire is forbidden in our sanctuary, humans of Tolmyur.”"
0,“It is only for protection against the dryads and to light our path.
0,We mean no harm.” 
0,"One by one, four more naiads stepped into the aura of firelight surrounding his soldiers."
0,"Kolbur’s sword hand shook, but as the leader of his men, he forced his body to retain the most meager sense of composure."
0,“Is this the kissiae sanctuary?
0,We are under orders to seek them out and request their aid.”
0,“The Eleionomai have guarded this sanctuary for millennia.
0,"The emperors of times past have charged us with protecting the kissiae from all who enter, whether they are humankind or elfkind or other, until the kissiae population recovers from the evils wrought against them by the races."
0,"When your leader claimed the empire, he renewed our charge."
0,Not even his own soldiers will be spared.”
0,"Three more naiads appeared, blocking their escape."
0,Kolbur heard a faint cry in the dark from far behind them.
0,Something happened to their observation scout.
0,"He and his soldiers were surrounded, but the enemy’s numbers were few."
0,"“Our discussion is with the kissiae, not their guards."
0,Let us pass.”
0,The naiad reached into the water and removed a sword.
0,It shone grander in the faint light than polished blue-moon silver.
0,"Resfahil, the metal embodiment of the wrath of the gods."
0,"The others did likewise, holding the weapons slack by their side."
0,"None spoke, and Kolbur knew the time for negotiation had passed."
0,"“If they are the guard, the kissiae must be beyond the marsh."
0,We advance!
0,Your magic will be nullified if in contact with their swords.
0,Only fight those who attack you.
0,Take courage.
0,Nymphs cannot use magic.”
0,The first naiad brandished her weapon.
0,“We have no need of magic.
0,We are elementals.”
0,Kolbur heard a splash from behind him and spun around.
0,"His blade caught the resfahil sword thrust at his back, deflecting it to the side."
0,"When the naiad hit the water, she vanished."
0,“They’re in the water!”
0,Multiple naiads surfaced with quick strikes piercing the backs and eviscerating the stomachs of his men inside the defensive perimeter.
0,All attempts to retaliate failed as the naiads disappeared into the shallow black marsh.
0,“None shall escape this cage.”
0,“Focus on the forward naiads!
0,We must reach land!” Kolbur charged the first naiad as two fireballs flew overhead.
0,They both dissipated with a weak sizzle when the naiad struck them down with her sword.
0,"An arrow flew past his ear, near invisible in the dark, and struck the naiad’s shoulder."
0,"When Kolbur slashed at her stomach, she did not raise her sword."
0,"She dropped into the water, disappearing and leaving only a bloody arrow behind."
0,“Arrows will wound them!
0,Protect the archers!
0,"Mages, keep your light!"
0,"Swordsmen, watch the water!”"
0,The soldiers moved as quick as was possible in the mud and silt.
0,"The light of their fires grew dim as the mages fell quickly to their invisible enemy within the water, first the minums and then the dwarves whose smaller statures slowed them."
0,"The visibility dropped from twenty yards to ten, then five."
0,"Kolbur had no time to look behind him to see how many of his men had fallen, but the clashes of metal grew fewer as did the death rows of his men."
0,"A naiad dove up from the water in front of Kolbur and caught him through the side with her blade, but his was also forward and plunged through her as he fell with her into the water."
0,Her body under him vanished like a handful of sand dropped in a flowing stream.
0,His lieutenant pulled him up by the collar and pushed him forward but was quickly run through by a naiad with a bloodstained stomach.
0,"She would die, but she was only one among many."
0,"Kolbur forged ahead driven by fear and panic, praying that he would reach dry ground where he could contest the naiads as equals."
0,"The splashing from the advance of he and his men masked the sounds of the surfacing naiads, and more fell to their unseen hands."
0,"A shimmer in the water caught the corner of Kolbur’s eye, and he swung his sword in fear."
0,"The moment the naiad surfaced, his blade removed her head from her shoulders, and she fell back into the water, bobbing in the ripples of his flight."
0,"If the arrow did not vanish with the Naiad in the water, neither would their swords."
0,“Look out for the glint of fahil in the water!
0,"Mages, make your flames brighter!”"
0,"The radius of light increased but immediately dimmed as more mages fell, but with them were the cries of the naiads."
0,"The light dimmed further, and soon Kolbur was on its perimeter, unable to see where he fled."
0,"If a naiad struck now, he could not defend."
0,"In desperation, he pushed his exhausted body further and tripped."
1,"His face hit moist earth, and as the dim light approached, he saw watergrass."
0,"He scrambled up the bank and turned behind him, sword forward in his heavy hand."
0,"Only four of his men remained and dashed across the water towards the shore, all human."
0,Two swordsmen reached him first followed by one mage holding a weak light in hand.
0,The final mage with bulging eyes full of fear and hope caught a sword through the back from a naiad who surfaced behind him.
0,"He fell forward, only his hand touching the shore."
0,Kolbur backed away up the bank.
0,The sole fire mage remained in center with a swordsman on each side.
0,"One by one, the naiads rose from the water."
0,"Two, five, ten, and then more than he cared to count; a whole multitude of them stood before Kolbur and his three remaining men, but they did not step on the shore."
0,Could they not leave the water?
0,One naiad walked forward.
0,She had a light bloodstain on her shoulder from that first arrow.
0,"She did not speak, but each step in the water was an executioner’s bell."
0,"Kolbur backed up, and so did his men."
0,"Her foot reached the shore, and she stepped up brandishing her glimmering blade."
0,"Kolbur’s back hit the thin trunk of a tree, and he felt a faint prickle on his left leg."
0,His right foot stepped forward followed by his left.
0,"When he raised his sword, Kolbur realized that these actions were not his own."
0,"He drove his own blade into the back of his swordsman, twisted it, and cut outward through the leather armor with strength he did not know he had."
0,His arm ached from the exertion.
0,The fire mage fell next before he could register what happened to the swordsman.
0,"The mages fireball fell with him, setting the fallen swordsman alight."
0,Stop!
0,Look out!
0,"Kolbur’s voice would not speak his mind, and no matter how he resisted, his body would not listen."
0,The final swordsman turned his back on the naiad threat before him and viewed Kolbur with an indescribable terror.
0,He was not looking directly at Kolbur but through or behind him.
0,"He raised his blade to strike Kolbur down, but Kolbur grabbed the swordsman’s wrist with incredible speed."
0,"Kolbur’s blade pierced the man’s stomach as a second sword pierced the swordsman from behind, its bloodied blade glistening in the light of the small fire."
0,The naiad cast the final swordsman to the side.
1,"Like a marionette whose strings had been cut, Kolbur fell to his back."
0,"Above him stood the naiad guard who had ordered the execution of his small band of soldiers, but she did not strike him down."
0,Another figure crawled over him and sat on his stomach.
0,She had smooth green skin and long ivy hair of heart-shaped leaves.
0,Her age and small stature reminded him of an elderly minum.
0,It was a kissiae.
0,"She did not speak, but her voice entered his mind."
0,“Jethro came to us and threatened our destruction if we did not offer a kissiae to his service.
0,Now you come into Dhuillir and threaten all the dryads with the same.
0,The kissiae are few.
0,You cannot have us.”
0,I had no choice!
0,"Kolbur screamed in his mind, unable to speak."
0,I know Jethro would have demanded your services again if he was here.
0,"The kissiae closed her eyes, and Kolbur felt a drain on his mind."
0,"When she opened her eyes again, her face grew a worried scowl."
0,"“You seek our aid to combat trespassers from another world, and Jethro has led an invasion into that same world?"
0,Do you not know the severity of the sin you have committed?!”
0,"The shout reverberated in Kolbur’s head, but instead of the aching of is ears, his mind throbbed with a debilitating pulse."
0,Sin?
0,What sin?
0,“Such a breach of taboo will bring destruction upon us all!” 
0,The elder kissiae gripped her long ivy hair in distress.
0,“Your knowledge is secondhand.
0,I cannot trust your estimates of the strength of these trespassers.
0,"If Bydrofe finds word of this, or worse, Gyea, even the kissiae may not survive.”"
0,"The kissiae removed herself from Kolbur’s stomach, and he found that he regained control of his body."
0,"In panic, he kicked back until his head hit the tree behind him."
0,"“On my word as acting matriarch of the kissiae, we will help you rid the Amelian Empire of these trespassers, but in repayment, should Jethro ever return to this world, you must execute him and bring me his head."
0,Do we have an accord?”
0,Cold sweat dripped from Kolbur’s beard.
0,Such an agreement was impossible for one of his rank to make.
0,He was only a new captain representing his general on a mission of his own suggestion.
0,"General Bregon may represent the Commanding General, but such a chain of delegation could never order the execution of that chain’s head."
0,"But, Jethro was in peril in the other world."
0,No one could know if he would return or if he was even alive.
0,"Even if Jethro returned, he was powerful, and Kolbur firmly believed that no one from this world could match him in order to execute him."
0,Only the strength of those in the other world who put him in peril could even compare.
0,“I… I cannot agree to those terms.
0,Not… not that I do not find them sufficient.
0,"If you could speak with General Bregon, as fourth in command below Commanding General Jethro, he would have the power to uphold your terms.”"
0,The kissiae frowned.
0,“The weak hearted shirk responsibility.
0,You were the one who decided to request our aid.
0,"However, I will meet with Bregon."
0,"If you will not uphold the terms, I will hold him and all those under him accountable.”"
0,The naiad genuflected to the kissiae.
0,"“If that is your wish, the Eleionomai will follow you into battle as your protectors.”"
0,Kolbur felt a prickle on his neck and a small hand on his shoulder.
0,Another kissiae leaned over and looked at him with her deep green eyes almost glowing in the shadow of her face.
0,Kolbur felt his exhaustion leave him.
0,"The pain in his side from the naiad’s sword vanished, but the ebb did not end there."
0,The relief of the pain grew to numbness and then an overpowering relaxation.
0,"Kolbur fell asleep, never to wake again."
0,"“We march for Melia,” the matriarch of the kissiae ordered as the fire consuming the swordsman slowly died."
1,"* * *
Emer stood in one of the kitchens of the palace."
0,"Two dryads knelt before him in praise, but he was not the one they worshiped."
0,The kissiae clinging to his back smiled lovingly back at them.
0,"Their skin showed deep scars in straight lines bisecting their legs, arms, torsos, and necks."
0,"When Keeya found them, their bodies sat shriveled and in pieces on the table."
0,"One dryad still missed an arm and the other missed a leg, but they were alive, pieced together and restored by Keeya’s life magic."
0,"They had no memory of what happened to them, and their minds were addled by the time they spent in death, but they knew their savior because she emanated a presence they could not ignore."
0,It was a feeling of instinct that she was a greater being than they.
0,“Arm and leg will regrow.
0,"You better now,” Keeya said with a smile as she dismissed them."
0,The two dryads hobbled out the door quietly singing Keeya’s praise with their weak voices.
0,"“I have never seen such skill in life magic,” Emer praised almost in chorus with the dryads, having acted as the conduit for Keeya to mend the dismembered bodies."
0,“I can imagine Jethro going mad if he witnessed it.
0,I suggest keeping this a secret from him.”
0,“But Jethro Keeya’s master.” 
0,"“If he does not ask about it, you have no reason to tell him anyway, right?” "
0,“…yes.” 
0,“I never imagined we would stumble upon such a scene while you explored the palace.
0,Could you really have not treated the chefs?”
0,“Chefs rotting.
0,Restore life and they die.
0,"Remove rot and restore life, body incomplete and still die."
0,"Remove rot, restore life, and heal body until body can hold life, maybe survive, but take long, long time, and other bodies rot more.”"
0,“I see… That is a shame.
0,I wonder why they were cooking dryads.”
0,"“Dryads edible, like elves and humans.” "
0,“That is not what I mean.
0,They were clearly ordered to cook the dryads and killed themselves out of guilt.
0,I am curious why.”
0,Keeya had a sudden and dark premonition.
0,"A feeling within her that she had numbed came to life, and she searched for the hearts of her fellow Kissiae."
0,"The sensation was weak, but she felt tension and worry."
0,"She wanted to know why, but Jethro had ordered her not to leave the palace, so she hid away the feeling once more, having it lingering and active in the back of her mind."
0,"Chapter 8
“The Resistance”
Ceil"
1,Ceil kept to the forests as much as possible.
0,Her greatest fear was that her small party would be discovered while passing the Tolmyur army.
0,"The flatlands were vast, but the army was both large and close enough that as she traveled, she could hear them like a wraith howling in the distance."
0,She caught up to the army at the first village but kept far enough south that she could only see the smoke that signaled the destruction of more lives.
0,"She hoped most of them fled, but after the massacre at Nalain, she knew that many would be too stubborn to abandon their homes."
0,"If the fairies had one major flaw, it was their pride."
0,Ceil forwent sleep for three days until she could no longer hear the whispers of death on the wind.
0,The army halted its march after the first village either to recuperate or because there was greater resistance than Ceil assumed was possible for such a small village.
0,"She could no longer hear the cry of war, but it continued sounding in her mind, fueled by memories of the destruction in the Gallanvale."
0,"The forest sung its lullaby through the wind and wildlife, but a weak and restless sleep was only possible in the arms of both Sammy and Chloe as they held her between them like a loving shield against the evils that chased her."
0,"The warmth reminded Ceil of Eydis and how she would often comfort her with the same loving embrace whenever Ceil was troubled and could not sleep, but worrying about being a wife to a man who did not love her felt so petty compared to being the cause of what may be the largest genocide in history."
0,"Her emotions leaked out a few days ago, so she renewed her conviction."
0,She was a leader--she was expected to be a leader--so she could never cry.
1,"* * *
“How long until we reach Revlan,” Chloe asked Ceil, who led the group silently with her red cedar staff gripped painfully tight in hand."
0,"“We are close,” Ceil replied without a hint of emotion."
0,“Which reminds me…” She stopped walking and searched her sack containing the party’s spare clothing.
0,She removed a white sash she often used to wrap around her waist to cover the pleats of her skirt.
0,"It was stained brown from blood in a few places, having been used to wrap Coby’s arrow wound in the past."
0,“Chloe should be fine because of her bright orange hair.
0,"No one from Tolmyur has that hair color, so they might think she is an oread, a Mountain Nymph."
0,"You on the other hand,” Chloe handed the sash to Sammy."
0,"“No offense, but you look half human, half dwarf.”"
0,“Dwarf?” Sammy repeated.
0,"“Your hair is brown, and your breasts are large."
0,"Your shoulders and hips are not broad enough, but you are short enough, hence half."
0,"In a region that is ravaged by Tolmyur, some may not hesitate to kill you on sight, even if they see you in the company of an elf and dryad."
0,Tie your hair in back and wrap that sash around your head to cover your ears.
0,Hopefully they will think you are some large-breasted half-fairy or something.
0,Anything is better than being human right now.”
0,Sammy retrieved the sash and unthreaded the tie from her satchel to bind her hair into a ponytail.
0,"“If you are making me disguise myself now, does that mean we will reach Revlan today?”"
0,"“If the distances on the map are accurate, we will reach it by mid-afternoon.” "
0,“What about Coby?” 
0,“I did not think about him… 
0,"There should not be any Habha his size in Vallen, but they might mistake him for a threat or possibly shoot him down for food."
0,He would be safer walking with us.”
0,“Okay.
0,COBY!”
0,Ceil jumped to Sammy and placed her hand over her mouth.
0,“What are you doing?”
0,Sammy pried Ceil’s hand away.
0,“How else am I going to call him?
0,You are the one who wanted him to stay in the air to warn us of danger.
0,"And the soldiers shouldn’t be anywhere close, right?”"
0,A cobalt-blue shadow broke through the canopy and landed beside Sammy.
0,She scratched the feathers on his neck lightly as she spoke.
0,"“It might be dangerous for you to fly right now, so you need to walk with us.”"
0,"Coby trilled and hopped excitedly, much to Ceil’s surprise."
0,She would have thought he hated the days when he was forced to follow them on foot due to his injury.
0,She almost wished she had Sammy’s ability to understand exactly how Coby felt.
0,"The brush rustled beside them, and the first thought in Ceil’s mind was that Sammy’s call had alerted a wayward scout or soldier of their location."
0,Lemi silently appeared when Ceil was sure she had been scouting ahead.
0,"Her bow was drawn, pointing in the direction of the noise."
0,A young fairy boy not even a year old and the size of an elf infant looked at Lemi’s drawn bow and fell to his knees.
0,He wet his worn and bloodstained tunic in fear and began to cry.
0,Lemi immediately dropped her bow and ran to the young boy with Chloe close behind.
0,"“He’s not hurt,” Lemi announced."
0,“The blood is not his.”
0,"“Where did you come from?” Sammy asked, kneeling in front of the boy next to Chloe."
0,The boy stifled his crying enough to manage a brief explanation before crying again.
0,“Mom told me to run…”
0,"“If he made it this far ahead of the army, he must have been from one of the earlier villages, before Nalain,” Ceil explained."
0,She turned away from the young boy.
0,The dried blood on his green tunic reminded her of the young nymph boy back in the Gallanvale.
0,Her shoulders quivered as she fought to maintain composure.
0,"“Let’s take him with,” Chloe said as she picked him up without care to his soiled clothing."
0,"“If we are close to Revlan, there should be someone who can take care of him.”"
0,"Coby bounced around Chloe, chirping lightly."
0,"“No, he’s not food,” Sammy reprimanded."
0,She removed one of the last strips of the goat-deer from Lemi’s sack and tossed it to Coby before he caused problems.
0,“We don’t have much of a choice.
0,We can’t leave him.”
0,"“There are probably many like him,” Ceil said as she walked ahead."
0,“And taking him to Revlan does not mean he will survive.”
1,"A few hours later, Lemi announced that she found a road."
0,"It was old and weathered, but people were traveling it in large numbers, all in the same direction."
0,"She did not say they were soldiers, so Ceil knew immediately that they were refugees who escaped the destruction of their villages and cities."
0,Groups of elves and fairies and other elfkind scattered among them bore sullen faces in the shade of the forest canopy overhanging the wide road.
0,The volume of traffic on the road was far larger than Ceil expected.
0,The relief that the death toll of the destroyed cities may not have been as large as she expected was overpowered by the knowledge that many cities would have fallen in order to create so many refugees.
0,"None looked at anyone outside their own groups, so none cared that there were two humans now walking among them, or perhaps Ceil’s assumptions were correct, and they thought Chloe was an oread and Sammy was at least something other than human."
0,"The longer they traveled the road, the more congested it became until Ceil saw walls that towered above the forest canopy."
0,"The lower half of the walls, level in height with the trees, had the same ancient structure as the ruins, but they had been fortified and built upon, doubling in height."
0,None of the city was visible beyond them.
0,"Fairy soldiers stood guard atop the newly fortified gatehouse and wall walk, watching the slow march of the refugees."
0,The congested procession slowed to a standstill as the refugees were ushered group by group through the gateway.
0,"Ceil grew more nervous with every step, and when she was close enough to see the teeth of the portcullis and the thin vines hanging down from them, her anxiety made her heart throb painfully."
0,"She could easily announce who she was and enter the city quickly ahead of the other refugees, but she had no way of knowing how they would react."
0,Would they blame her for the destruction of Vallen and the genocide of their people?
0,"If I were them, I would, she thought."
0,Sammy wrapped her arm around Ceil’s waist and held her close.
0,"Ceil wanted to push her away and drown in the suffering that she knew she had caused, but the crowd was pushing Sammy against her just as much as Sammy was embracing her, so Ceil let Sammy try to comfort her, even though her heart would not be comforted."
0,"She stood neck-deep in the murky depths of her pained heart, and the waves lapped at her face for every cry that reached her ears."
0,Part of her wanted to drown in the putrid waters and end the agony once and for all.
1,"When their turn arrived at the gate, Ceil fell silent."
0,Sammy spoke to the fairy guard in her place.
0,“We found this young boy in the forest.
0,Is there somewhere in the city where he can be cared for?”
0,"“There is a representative from the orphanage on the other side of the gate,” the guard replied, visibly astonished with Sammy’s linguistic ability."
0,“What city have you come from?”
0,"“We are not from Vallen, but we have business here."
0,We came from Melia.”
0,“Melia?” 
0,"Sammy pointed to Lemi, and the guard eyed the Anthousai and Coby who stood on her shoulders like an incredibly large headdress, scattering some of the petals in her moss-like hair."
0,"The other refugees grew restless from the longer-than-normal conversation, desperately wanting to enter the safety of the walls, so the guard quickly gave Sammy permission to pass through."
0,She held back the long vines hanging from the portcullis to let Chloe and the young boy pass.
0,Ceil followed next and then Lemi.
0,Coby hopped off Lemi and waited patiently for Sammy to follow.
0,Coby bellowed a fearsome cry that echoed through the tunnel.
0,Ceil looked behind her for the reason.
0,There Sammy was held against the wall with a thick white cord around her neck.
0,"“Human,” a female voice announced in an alarming shout, and guards appeared on both sides of the tunnel."
0,"No one else questioned Sammy’s appearance, and they were not attacking Chloe."
0,How did they know?
0,Ceil realized the reason for the vines.
0,"If they were a conduit for a life mage, anyone who touched them could get scanned."
0,"It was likely meant for quarantine in case someone came to such a populated refugee city with a transmittable disease, but at the same time, it could also check the race of the individual."
0,Sammy was the only one who touched the vines.
0,"Coby jumped and grabbed the cord on Sammy’s neck with his beak to try and break it, but it held taught."
0,"Sammy’s face grew red then a light shade of purple, and saliva drained from her mouth."
0,It continued tightening as if something was pulling it from inside the wall.
0,Something was pulling it.
0,"There was a nymph in the stone, an oread, and the white cord was made from her hair."
0,"When the guards from outside the wall neared, Coby faced them and flapped his wings."
0,"The funnel of wind sent the small fairies flying back into the crowds, and the force of the wind strengthened by the tunnel knocked the refugees down, creating a cascade of bodies in the congested line."
0,"Lemi pulled her bowstring, aiming at the soldiers approaching from the city, but hesitated to fire."
0,Chloe was unable to help protect anyone with the child in her arms.
0,"“On the name of Ceil, widow of Emperor Yuro Amel, Empress of the Amelian Empire, I demand you release this human!”"
0,"Ceil slammed her staff into the wall near Sammy, its clack echoing through the tunnel."
0,"The cord grew slack, and Sammy gasped for breath, falling to her knees."
0,"The soldiers approached, but Ceil held her staff in front of Sammy, acting as her guard."
0,"“Stand down,” she ordered."
0,The soldiers slowed and then halted.
0,Lemi ran to Sammy to heal the rope burn and any damage the cord might have caused her neck.
0,Coby’s wings spanned the width of the tunnel and blocked the soldiers who had recovered and returned from outside the wall.
0,His single cry of warning was enough to hold them back.
0,"A guard bearing an insignia on his breast, possibly a ranking officer, approached from the city-side entrance of the tunnel."
0,He stopped short of Ceil and looked up into her eyes.
0,"“I am Salim, captain of the guard."
0,What connection do you have to Empress Ceil?”
0,"His voice held doubt, but his expression was not accusatory."
0,"No one would be daring, or foolish, enough to use the empress’s name without connection to her."
0,“I am Ceil.
0,Should I show you my tails?” 
0,“That will not be necessary.”
0, Salim ushered a much taller guard forward.
0,"This guard was two heads taller than Ceil, a male High Elf."
0,"The man held out his hand, and when Ceil touched it, she felt a pulse travel through her arm and down to her lower back."
0,Ceil’s chest pounded hard enough for her head to throb.
0,She could no longer escape.
0,"However this city viewed her, she would find out now."
0,"The High Elf knelt immediately, pressing his face to the stone."
0,“Empress.”
0,"The oread walked out of the wall, her flowing white gown catching in the wind of the tunnel."
0,She looked every bit a human aside from her vibrant orange hair.
0,She prostrated herself before Ceil.
0,"“I have made a grave error, and I will accept any punishment for harming your companion.”"
0,"Salim knelt, and all the soldiers followed."
0,“We sincerely apologize for our rudeness.
0,"We never expected that you would come here, or that you would have a human in your company.”"
0,Relief washed over Ceil.
0,She looked over at Sammy who smiled back wearily and without any ire.
0,"“If Sammy died, things would be different."
0,"You were only performing your duties, so I will not punish you."
0,"Although Sammy is human, she and her people are not of Tolmyur and are enemies to Jethro and his armies the same as us.”"
0,“We are eternally grateful for your clemency.” 
0,“Your eternity may come sooner than you think.
0,"I must speak with whoever is in charge of Revlan’s defenses, the marshal, or other city official.”"
0,“The inner sanctum of the temple in the center of the city has been repurposed into the council chamber for the resistance.
0,All key officials should be there.
0,We can guide you.”
0,A female guard approached Chloe.
0,“We can take the child for you here.
0,I will make certain he receives the best care.”
0,Ceil nodded for Chloe to set down the child.
0,"The fairy guard, short enough to be a child herself, grabbed his quivering hand."
0,“You can treat him no different than any of the other children.
0,"If you could provide better care for any one of the orphans, should you not already be doing so for all of them?”"
0,The guard bowed deeply.
0,"“Yes, Your Highness."
0,It is as you say.”
0,"“I will lead you to the temple,” the captain of the guard announced."
1,“Clear the way!”
0,The soldiers blocking the path to the tunnel exit parted and stood at attention along the walls.
0,Ceil offered her hand to Sammy.
0,“Are you alright?”
0,“I’m fine.
0,Lemi patched me up.
0,I’m more startled than anything else now.
0,How can that woman enter the wall?”
0,"Salim led them towards the exit of the tunnel, and Ceil pulled Sammy to follow."
0,“Oreads look human but are stone elementals.
0,Some elementals are able to meld with their environment.
0,Nymphs are one of the few with this capability.
0,Golems for example are stone elementals but cannot.”
0,“Even their clothes?
0,And that rope?”
0,“Nymphs are spinners.
0,They use their own hair to make silk.
0,The color is only vibrant when it is attached.
0,"When cut, it fades white and frays into many fine fibers."
0,"When a nymph weaves clothing from her own hair, she can treat it as her body."
0,The cord was the same.
0,It was made from her hair.”
0,“So they could easily find out I am not an oread by plucking one of my hairs?” Chloe asked.
0,“They could.
0,"I did not think of that, but it is not an issue now."
0,"I do not think any of the soldiers will harm you once they are informed, but we should still be careful in the city."
0,The refugees and citizens may be less… controlled than the soldiers.”
1,"The tunnel opened into a bailey, or perhaps it was too large for a bailey."
0,The field stretched for a half mile until reaching the inner walls that stood only slightly taller than the perimeter walls.
0,The air carried a pungent aroma of bodies and refuse.
0,Small tents were packed as close together as was possible in order to house the innumerable refugees arriving at the city.
0,"The extravagant paved road suggested that this may have once been a beautiful park courtyard outside the city proper but was fashioned into a refugee camp after removing all the trees, shrubbery, and other structures that may have been present."
0,"The outer wall hugged the courtyard and then widened outward with the inner wall, creating the shape of the thin neck of a pear if the city was larger in diameter."
0,"Soldiers clad in light leather administered food and aid to the refugees, directing them where to camp or seek other assistance."
0,A benefit of the fairy’s small stature was that they could be packed together in small spaces if needed.
0,"Against the perimeter wall, scaffolds had been constructed to fit multiple levels of tents atop one another."
0,"The courtyard appeared filled to bursting, and there were still so many on the road desiring to enter."
0,"“This is terrible,” Chloe whispered barely loud enough for Ceil to hear."
0,"The refugees paid Ceil little attention, only following her and her companions with their eyes if not occupied elsewhere."
0,"Ceil refrained from eye contact, only looking at the inner wall and the domed cylindrical structure even further in the distance that barely showed above it."
0,The inner wall was not like the ruins.
0,"It was new, clearly constructed by earth mage artisans for defense of the inner city."
0,The only remains of what could have been the original ruins were the pointed archway leading to steps downward through a tunnel half the length of the perimeter wall’s gatehouse and the towers that rose every hundred yards or so along the inner wall.
0,"To the sides, the space between the inner and perimeter walls was also being used for the refugee camp."
0,"If the space circled the entire city, then perhaps they would have room for them all, unless that too was as filled as the courtyard."
1,The steps through the inner wall only descended the height of a single-story structure.
0,"What met them on the other side helped Ceil understand why Revlan, the third most populous city in Vallen, was known as the western capital."
0,It was a grand sunken city of stone spread in a wide oblong circle.
0,Where they stood was only one of three sunken tiers of the city.
0,"The structures of the first tier just below ground level rose to the height of the inner wall, and those of the second tier rose to the level of the first."
0,"Thin towers at the end of stone bridges overlooked the sunken city from above, connected intermittently to the bases of the towers of the inner wall."
0,"Trees and shrubs grew atop the flat-top structures with their roots, boughs, and vines running down the sides."
0,The stone of the ruins was in pristine condition as if time had never touched them.
0,The tiers of the city rose near the center until reaching a curtain wall at ground level.
0,"The structures beyond it were far grander than those on the tiers, and a cylindrical, domed structure sat in the center with wide towers overlooking the city."
0,That was likely the temple and their destination.
0,Sammy and Chloe stood frozen with slack jaws atop the steps down to the second tier.
0,"Having only seen Fiorrae, Melia, and a single ruined town a small fraction of this city’s size, Ceil understood their amazement."
0,"Amel and the Amelian palace were grander, but the natural beauty living in harmony with ancient stone was breathtaking even for Ceil."
0,"“All those ruins we saw, did they all have cities underneath them like this?"
0,And that wall in the center of the city looks just like the wall at Nalain.
0,Does that mean there was a giant city surrounding it underground there as well?”
0,"“I would not be able to answer that,” Ceil replied, waving at them to follow."
0,“This looks like a dwarven city.
0,"Are there caves here too?” Chloe asked, trotting down the steps to Ceil."
0,"“Dwarves live on mountains, not underground or in caves,” Ceil replied."
0,"“Oh, I guess I shouldn’t expect stories from Earth to apply here.”"
0,"“I’m glad there’s a lot of green here,” Lemi exclaimed cheerfully."
0,"The lower tiers of the city were very crowded, but not nearly as dense as the refugee camp."
0,The upper tiers appeared to be homes with the lowest tiers being craftshops and the mid tiers having many interspersed vendors between the residences.
0,"They did not need to enter the lowest tier of the city, keeping to an elevated walkway that crossed it."
0,The steps up the tiers to the center of the city were wide.
0,The structures were grander and the gardens atop them more landscaped.
1,Guards stood before the gateway of the curtain wall and saluted the captain of the guard as he passed.
0,Ceil refrained from eye contact and did not mind that they treated her like some inconsequential visitor.
0,"In time, the entire city would know who she was and that she was here, so she wanted to bask in the anonymity while she could."
0,The first tier of the inner city was the only location in the city that was not crowded.
0,Extravagant homes for city officials and large manors for nobles lined the inside of the wall.
0,"The large, peaceful gardens and hedged borders gave the illusion that the city was not in the midst of a war that threatened its destruction."
0,"The servants still tended the gardens, and the nobles Ceil passed chatted freely as if the hordes of refugees entering their city to escape slaughter did not concern them."
0,Their indifference infuriated her.
0,Millions of fairies had died.
0,Did these fools think themselves immune?
1,The apathy of the nobles soured Ceil’s mood as she climbed the steps to the temple grounds.
0,The captain of the guard led Ceil to the large cylindrical structure.
0,"Pointed arch windows surrounded its three floors, and its polished white dome reflected the sun."
0,"Unlike the rest of the city, this was the only structure without vegetation growing off it."
0,The main hall contained altars to the four elements and statues of the deities representing the first ancestor of each race of elfkind.
0,It was not unlike the Temple of the Gods on the palace grounds.
0,"Ceil looked up at the towering, gilded statue of the first High Elf."
0,He held a sickle at his side and a bundle of grain across his chest.
0,"The inscription at the base of the statue in Amel read “Nelhah-vlensi,” to lead the nations, but this statue bore the inscription “Nelhah-mein-ceil,” to nourish the nations."
1,"“Her Highness, Empress Ceil, has come to speak with the generals,” Salim announced to the four soldiers standing guard in front of a large double door."
0,"Almost forgetting proper form, they scrambled to open the door and bowed their heads as Ceil passed."
0,"A small, circular inner sanctum sat at the end of a long, sun-lit corridor which felt strange considering there were no windows, and the sun holes did not appear to reach outside."
0,Some strange architecture was at work to transfer the sunlight into the corridor and inner sanctum.
0,"The voices of those seated around the circular table echoed perfectly off the stone, each as clear as if they were standing beside Ceil."
0,"“Now that Nalain has fallen, we must begin preparations for battle.”"
0,"“You need not worry, Thorn General."
0,Your age has made you fearful.
0,I have turned this city into the greatest fortress in the Empire.”
0,"“A fortress does nothing unless properly defended, Lord Olvor,” replied a young, bearded fairy directly across the table from the corridor."
0,“We lost five thousand valiant soldiers in Nalain.
0,That only leaves us ten thousand soldiers against the unknown many of Tolmyur.
0,We must begin training the citizens of the city and the refugees.
0,The enemy is already on our doorstep.”
0,"“Leave matters of war to the Thorn General,” Lord Olvor rebuked."
0,“You should be focusing on the worsening refugee situation.”
0,"“We would still have those five thousand soldiers, and the five thousand innocent civilians would have survived if you listened to me and evacuated Nalain,” the bearded fairy replied, pounding his fist on the table."
0,Ceil saw a black scar on the bearded fairy’s wrist.
0,Memories of the Gallanvale flooded her mind.
0,The decision of what cities she would hide in.
0,"The destruction of Yeai, Ofaeth, and Hor."
0,The appearance of Jethro’s army.
0,The slaughter.
0,And the marshal who sold her to Jethro because her death would save the fairies.
0,"A black wave rose in the abyssal depths of Ceil’s heart, climbing ever higher and threatening to consume her."
0,"The deathly skeletal specter reached around her and embraced her from behind, standing firm and breaking the force of the wave to prevent her from being swept away."
0,"It laughed into her ear, a laugh that escaped Ceil’s lips as a whisper."
0,Ceil sprinted for the table.
0,"The rigid wood of her red cedar staff cracked, and the tip grew two long, jagged spines."
0,The marshal only managed to glance at Ceil before she dove onto the table and impaled him in the chest.
0,"Her momentum carried him over his chair, toppling it to the ground, and she pinned him to the wall."
0,The sanctum was in an uproar.
0,“What is the meaning of this!?”
0,“Lady Ceil?” 
0,The voice of Chief Advisor Kiri that Ceil had nearly forgotten fell deaf on her ears.
0,"“Why did you live,” Ceil whispered through her teeth."
0,"“To save what your existence has doomed,” the marshal replied through bloodied gargles."
0,"Ceil gripped her staff tight, the splinters from its cracks cutting into her hands."
0,All the ven she could give flowed through the staff.
0,Black splotches grew on the marshal’s skin and quickly grew into seething blisters.
0,The blood draining from his mouth grew dark and putrid.
0,His skin sagged until all at once it rotted off his body as his wailing cries echoed through the stone sanctum.
0,"His tissue softened and his flesh melted, seeping through his clothes onto the floor at Ceil’s feet."
0,No one approached.
0,"Sammy, Chloe, and Lemi watched in horror from the corridor."
0,An ominous silence filled the room where the cries had grown silent.
0,"Life magic could be used for both help and harm, but none in the room had witnessed true death magic until now."
0,“Ceil…” 
0,A small hand rested on Ceil’s shoulder.
0,She turned and saw pure terror in Kiri’s eyes.
0,Ceil looked at the moist skeleton at the end of the staff and the blackened puddle of gore at her feet.
0,"She dropped the staff and corpse and stepped back, nearly tripping over the toppled chair, until her back hit the table."
0,"“Has the girl gone mad,” one of the fairies cried."
0,"“No,” the eldest fairy in the room replied."
0,“Ceil would not act in such hatred without a cause.” 
0,"His slender face was affixed into stern chastisement of the council member who spoke, the glare accentuating the deep creases of his eyes."
0,"His hairline receded halfway over his head, but his white hair was long and looped many times into a low ponytail with a dark green ribbon."
0,"The robe he wore was faded, but the ample colors and intricate embroidery showed that it had once been quite exquisite in its time."
0,“What reason could Lady Ceil have to kill the Rose General in such a horrendous manner?!”
0,“…Rose General…?” Ceil looked across the table at the most recent voice.
0,“He was the Rose General?
0,"You made him, of all the fairies, the highest welfare authority in Vallen?”"
0,“He singlehandedly evacuated a dozen of the smallest villages before the armies of Tolmyur arrived.
0,He always kept two steps ahead of them.”
0,"“What crime could he possibly have committed that deserved such punishment,” another fairy shouted."
0,"“Ceil, tell us,” Kiri pleaded."
0,"Ceil looked across all the angry and terrified faces, stopping on the eldest fairy who only smiled lovingly back."
0,“Do you truly not know?
0,He was the one who informed Jethro that I was in Vallen.
0,"Because of him, all of Vallen--”"
0,Angry shouts and accusations against the legitimacy of Ceil’s claim assaulted her from all around the table.
0,Ceil could not stop herself from shaking.
0,Sammy ran around the table and held Ceil to shield her from the voices raised against her.
0,"“Is that a human?” Lord Olvor hollered, standing from his chair."
0,“She has brought a human into my city?
0,The Rose General would never betray us!
0,That girl is a traitor!”
0,"The eldest fairy swung his fist, knocking Lord Olvor beside him unconscious with strength unseemly for one of his years."
0,“I will not allow anyone here to speak treason against our empress!”
0,The voices died around the table.
0,"Ceil looked up from Sammy’s shoulder at the fairy, questioning why he alone would take her side."
0,"“If we doubt our empress now, all hope in the future of our empire will fall."
0,"Ceil is not one to make such fabrications,” he asserted."
0,“Then what of that human?”
0,"“I am not from Tolmyur,” Sammy shouted in the Gallanvale tongue of the fairies."
0,“Jethro is my enemy as much as he is yours.
0,Shame on all of you for questioning Ceil’s loyalty.
0,You have no idea how much this conflict has tormented her or how much she blames herself for it!”
0,Tears flowed down Sammy’s face enough for both Ceil and her.
0,“She has even wanted to take her own life out of hope that her death will end your people’s suffering.
0,And now you throw that loyalty back in her face and accuse her of treason?”
0,Everyone but the eldest fairy was stunned silent.
0,"“Sammy, that is enough,” Ceil said, clinging to what felt like her only friend in a world that despised her."
0,"“Ceil is the first empress in history with fairy blood,” the eldest fairy announced."
0,“And you question her commitment to this conflict?
0,"By my right as Thorn General, I should have you all executed.”"
0,"No one in the sanctum could speak, and Ceil looked back at the Thorn General in disbelief."
0,The Thorn General left his chair and walked to Sammy and Ceil.
0,"He grasped Sammy’s hand and bowed, pressing the back of her hand to his forehead."
0,“Thank you for being there for my granddaughter in her greatest time of trial.”
0,"Chapter 9
“Ceil”
Ceil"
1,The Thorn General dismissed the council.
0,"Only Ceil and her companions, the Thorn General, and Chief Advisor Kiri remained."
0,"Three life mages were called in, one to carry out Lord Olvor for treatment and two to clean the remains of the Rose General in case contact with the body was hazardous."
0,Lemi would not even approach it and appeared more terrified of it than anyone else had been.
0,"Ceil felt bad for scaring Lemi--she scared herself after realizing what horrid magic she just used, magic she never learned--but she felt justified in what she did."
0,"She may have been the purpose of the genocide, but he was the cause."
0,"“Let us go somewhere more comfortable to speak,” the Thorn General said, leaving the two High Elves to their traumatizing cleanup."
1,The Thorn General led them off the temple grounds and around to the other side of the noble district to an estate far smaller than most of the others.
0,"The two-story ancient manor had a well-kept yard and garden, but the plants on the structure were allowed to grow freely, giving it a sylvan beauty different than the other manors."
0,"Lemi was pleased with the forested appearance and pranced across the garden to admire the long fern-like fronds draping down one of the windows, her dava clacking lightly all the while."
0,"“Lemi, we are going inside,” Sammy called."
0,“Let her be.
0,She can enter whenever she pleases.
0,"Cities of stone are often unnerving for dryads, especially the young ones,” the Thorn General said."
0,“Coming!
0,"I want to be part of the talking, too.” "
0,"Lemi ran, gathered her dava, and hopped the small gate instead of opening it."
0,She followed Sammy inside while the Thorn General held open the intricately carved floral door.
1,"Although the outside of the structure was stone, the inside was warm and welcoming."
0,"Polished wood panels covered the walls, floors, and ceiling to hide the stone."
0,Large rugs decorated with nature patterns covered most of the floor.
0,"The furniture was finely crafted, but most was small and meant for the short stature of the fairies."
0,"The ceiling was high enough for a fully grown High Elf to stand comfortably, hinting that the original inhabitants of the ancient city were not small like the fairies."
0,Even the rooms were lavishly decorated with indoor plants to match the lush green exterior.
0,"“I do not have enough chairs for taller guests, but I do have plentiful cushions to sit on,” the Thorn General said."
0,He led them to a lounge with a low table in the center and bookshelves lining the walls.
0,A large portrait of a much younger general in regal armor hung from the wall opposite the outward-facing window.
0,"“Kiri, I have cushions in the storage room upstairs."
0,Do you mind retrieving them while I prepare food and drink?”
0,“Gladly.” Kiri disappeared up the tight spiral steps beside the central hallway.
0,"“We cannot impose on you like this,” Sammy said, speaking for Ceil who remained silent since the accusations against her in the inner sanctum."
0,“Do you not have servants like the other nobles?”
0,"“While most retired persons of status would prefer to spend their time lazing about as others pampered them, such a lifestyle would drive me mad."
0,"As the former Thorn General, I feel I must keep active."
0,"If such a time comes when I can no longer care for myself, I will accept my end peacefully."
0,I never thought that I would be pulled out of retirement by a war that killed my successor in the first battle.”
0,“Then even the yard and garden?”
0,"“Gardening is quite cathartic, it turns out,” the Thorn General chuckled."
0,Sammy grew a lonely smile.
0,“My mother said the same thing.
0,"We hire groundskeepers to take care of our property, but my mother always had her own personal garden they were not allowed to touch.”"
0,"“Your language ability is astonishing, Lady Sammy."
0,You speak as if you were raised in the Gallanvale.
0,Might I assume that you have had dealings with the Sprite Arkhon?”
0,"“How did you know?” Sammy asked, wide-eyed."
0,“That will be part of our discussion.”
0,"Kiri returned carrying six floor cushions, and the Thorn General helped place them around the low table."
0,They were flat but surprisingly soft and supported weight well without feeling the hard floor underneath.
0,Coby alone opted to perch on the short settee against the window.
0,"“Sorry, Kiri, but our conversation held me up and I was unable to bring out refreshments."
0,Could you help me?”
0,“Can I help too?” Lemi asked.
0,“Of course.”
1,The three left the room leaving Ceil alone with Sammy and Chloe beside her at the table.
0,"“Are you okay?” Sammy asked, rubbing Ceil’s shoulder."
0,Ceil did not answer.
0,"The events in the inner sanctum were what she expected to happen when the fairies learned her identity, that she would be labeled a traitor for bringing this destruction upon Vallen, but she did not expect their ire to come from her execution of one who was just as guilty."
0,That conflict tormented her.
0,Was she in the right to kill him?
0,"She did not regret it, but thinking on what the both of them had accomplished since the assassination, perhaps the council was right to be furious."
0,Ceil had spent every day being cared for by the sprites in Fiorrae while the former marshal was working hard to save lives ahead of the Tolmyur army.
0,"Once she left Fiorrae, it was one mistake after another."
0,"Her identity was discovered, she gave someone important to the war--someone dear to Sammy--into the hands of the enemy, and she pulled Dhuillir into the conflict when they would have otherwise been safe."
0,"“Ceil, look at me,” Chloe said, placing her hand gently on Ceil’s other shoulder."
0,“Nobody expects you to be perfect or make the right decision all the time.
0,"I don’t know what happened back there or if what you did was right or wrong, but I trust you.”"
0,“Would you trust me… even if you might die because of me?” 
0,"Chloe’s brush with death was still fresh on Ceil’s mind, and now they were in a city that the Tolmyur army would inevitably assault, placing them in further danger."
0,"“The Sprite Arkhon said I was important to this war, right?"
0,I think that means I won’t die so easily.
0,I hope.
0,"But my magic is strong for some reason, so I’m more than happy to use it to help you."
0,"Jethro is evil, and you are trying to help people."
0,That is good enough reason for me.
0,You don’t need to be perfect.
0,Just keep doing what you think is right.”
0,"Chloe’s words lifted a small weight from Ceil’s heart, helping her breathe a little easier, but it did not remove the guilt."
0,"Ceil considered Sammy a dear friend, but she had only viewed Chloe as one of Sammy’s companions, simply an addition to their party."
0,If Chloe is willing to risk her life following me… 
0,"No, she already almost died following my orders… "
0,Ceil remembered her own fearful cry when she saw Chloe injured in her fight against the soldiers in Melia.
0,"I knew, but I never treated Chloe as a friend."
0,"“Sorry,” Ceil said, bowing her head and trying to hold back her tears."
0,Sammy and Chloe embraced Ceil from both sides.
0,"“Sorry,” Ceil repeated."
1,"“Snacks!” Lemi exclaimed, entering the lounge with a tray in hand."
0,She looked at the scene and paused.
0,“Is Ceil alright?”
0,“I am fine.” 
0,Ceil nudged Sammy and Chloe to return to their cushions.
0,“Thank you.”
0,Lemi set down her tray on the table.
0,"It was topped with circular, frilled biscuits, cheese, and fruit."
0,"The Thorn General entered next carrying a platter of carved, salt-cured meat."
0,Kiri followed right behind him with a tray of brass goblets and a large silver carafe with steam wafting from the top.
0,She set the tray down and filled everyone’s goblets while Sammy selected some fruit and meat to give Coby to keep him occupied.
0,"“This is more of a meal than a snack,” Chloe said as she picked through the fruit."
0,"“Lemi, one of your petals got in my drink,” Sammy chuckled."
0,"“A petal falling in your glass is a sign of good luck,” Kiri explained."
0,“Perhaps more so because it is from an anthousai.” 
0,Sammy took a sip from her goblet and blinked quickly a few times.
0,“Is this wine?”
0,“It is not strong.
0,"One of the best lessons my superior taught me long ago was that wine loosens the lips and supports the heart when discussing heavy topics,” the Thorn General said."
0,Ceil took a light sip and felt the comforting warmth flow down her throat.
0,"“Tell me,” she swirled the faint red liquid in her goblet, “are you really my grandfather?”"
0,The Thorn General closed his eyes and nodded.
0,“I suppose we should start from there.” 
0,He took a swig of his wine and breathed deep.
0,"“My name is Dharin, twin brother of the late Fairy High King Dhurin, and I am your great grandfather.”"
0,“How can that be?
0,My entire family was High Elves.
0,We never had any fairies in our lineage.
0,"And if we did, the emperor would have never taken me to wife."
0,Would that not go against the royal family’s pure heritage?”
0,"“One thing at a time,” Kiri said."
0,Ceil stared at the Chief Advisor.
0,“Did you know?
0,Did you know all the way back then?”
0,"“Both Dharin and King Dhurin are my grandfathers, Dharin from my mother’s side and King Dhurin from my father’s."
0,I am your first cousin once removed.
0,"The maid that served so bravely as your Namie… Vera was my daughter, your second cousin."
0,"We did not know who of our household your family discussed openly, so she was under my orders to never divulge her name out of fear that you or others might discover your lineage now that you would be wife to Emperor Yuro and involved with High Elf nobility and other racial purists."
0,"You were born in the Gallanvale, not on the plains of Filinceil."
0,Your family moved to Heivleil shortly after your birth.”
0,"“Your grandfather was not a legitimate child,” Dharin explained."
0,"“I regret to say it was a passing fancy of my youth that I intended to forget, but your great grandmother raised him together with her other High Elf children with such love and devotion that I felt obligated to stay involved."
0,I am glad that I did.
0,"His son, your father, was tall despite his fairy blood, so the truth of his ancestry remained a family secret."
0,"I only met you once when you were an infant during your naming, right after I retired and Kiri’s husband became Thorn General.”"
0,“Was that not bad?
0,My parents hid the fact that I was part fairy from the emperor when they sold me to him.”
0,“Yuro knew about you and your ancestry before your father spread news of your tails among the nobles.
0,"The original plan was for the empire to watch over you in secret, but because of your father’s foolish actions to make quick money during the famine, when he revealed your existence to lesser nobles, Yuro claimed you first so that you could be better protected.”"
0,“That does not make any sense.
0,Why would the emperor know about me?
0,I never became important until I was his wife.”
0,"Dharin took another swig of his wine, and Kiri topped off his goblet."
0,“This is where the discussion grows heavy.
0,"There is only one other High Elf in all the empire who has two tails, and she is very old, a hundred and twelve now if I am correct, or perhaps she has already passed."
0,The sprites have a powerful foresight.
0,"In their predictions, a High Elf girl would be born with two tails, and her birth was to be the sign of the greatest catastrophe since the destruction of the ancient civilization in whose ruins we now reside."
0,"The empress of the time, Denever, prepared to defend the Amelian Empire from whatever calamity might befall it, but nothing happened."
0,"Many resources were wasted, and the fear created undue civil unrest."
0,"She and the next two Emperors lost faith in the foresight of the sprites, so the fairy kings inherited the mantle of the sprites’ prophesies."
0,"The sprites only communicate with one who will listen, and they always communicate with someone."
0,"“My father was the Fairy High King at the time, so I knew Yuro from when he was a child."
0,"The Sprite Arkhon was always in conversation with my family, so I was able to convince Yuro to trust the sprites as his ancestors once had."
0,"It was fortuitous that the sign not only reappeared during the reign of an emperor who would believe in it, but it appeared as one of my descendants.”"
0,"“If he knew this was going to happen, why did he not stop it?” Sammy asked."
0,"“That is because it has not started yet, Lady Sammy."
0,"As terrible as this war is, it is only the precursor of far worse events to come."
0,"In gratitude to Yuro for restoring faith in the sprites, the sprites informed him of his fate, that he would not live to see the fulfillment of their prophesy, so he chose instead to raise his heir with as much knowledge as he could so that she would be able to prepare the empire against the coming storm.”"
0,“My birth was just the sign?
0,Then why did I need to be protected?
0,"And if I only needed to be protected, why did he make me his wife?” "
0,Ceil’s eyes darkened as she peered into the dark red of her goblet.
0,"“I mean… I would have accepted it if he had showed me affection, if he had tried to get to know me… if he truly wanted to love me…”"
0,"“I do not doubt that Yuro had no love for you, as sad as it may sound."
0,He was fundamentally a traditionalist who believed strongly in the pure bloodline of the royal family.
0,He never could have imagined that you would become the empress.
0,"I do not know the full reason for his decision, but my guess is that your role in this tale was not limited to the sign of your birth."
0,You may be vital in ending the calamity or leading the people through it.
0,We do not know.
0,"All we knew was to protect you until your time, an order given us directly by the Sprite Arkhon."
0,What better protection could there be for you than as a wife to the Emperor of the Amelian Empire?”
0,“So I was to be doomed to a life without love…” 
0,Ceil fell silent and looked at the goblet in her hands.
0,"The wine was growing cold, so Chloe retrieved it to warm it for her."
0,“Do you know why your mother named you Ceil?” Dharin asked after handing his goblet to Chloe to request the same service.
0,Soon everyone was passing their goblets to Chloe.
0,“She wanted me to live my life as a modest farm girl.”
0,Dharin shook his head.
0,“Ceil is one of the oldest roots in the High Elf language.
0,"Yes, it means grain, but it also can be interpreted as life."
0,Are you aware of the ancient name of the High Elves?”
0,“Grassland Elves.” 
0,"“Those monikers were adopted shortly before the creation of the Amelian Empire as a means of unifying the races under a single name, only distinguishing them by their location, hence Forest Elf for spriggans, Mountain Elf for trolls, or Sea Elf for sirens."
0,"The Grassland Elves are the only true elves, and they had another name, the Celadrian, or ‘Ceil-adri-han’.”"
0,“Givers of grain?” 
0,"“Providers of life,” Sammy replied."
0,Dharin smiled warmly at Sammy.
0,“It appears your gift of translation has revealed to us the proper meaning.
0,They may have received their name from their agricultural prowess or due to their natural affinity to life magic that made them renowned as healers.
0,"In either case, your name is the origin of the High Elves."
0,"Your mother named you Ceil with the blessing that you would become a shining beacon to provide hope to the High Elves, and by extension the whole empire, in the coming trials."
0,"Your father protested the name at first, but he lacked the same heart for poetry as your mother."
0,He only saw it as an ear of grain in the literal sense.”
0,"The conversation fell silent, either to give Ceil time to process what was said or because no more needed to be discussed on the topic."
0,"Ceil vaguely remembered Kiri saying something similar to her long ago, that what the empire needed most was a beacon."
0,She did not know how to respond or if she even should.
0,Again she felt as if the wrong person was sitting here.
0,"Emperor Yuro raised Eydis to lead the people, not her."
0,"Ceil was only raised with the most basic knowledge of politics and rule, because her caretakers believed Ceil’s duty was in the bed of the emperor, not standing before the people."
0,"“I…” Before Ceil could voice her apprehensions, Lemi’s head fell forward into the table, sitting motionless with sleepy breaths."
0,"“It seems the wine was a bit much for her,” Kiri said, moving to lay her on the floor with her cushion as a pillow."
0,"“I was wondering if wine was okay for someone as young as her to drink,” Sammy mused."
0,“Nonsense.
0,Wine of this potency would be safe for even children.
0,"Dryads only lack the means to process alcohol,” Dharin explained."
0,“Are you sure?
0,"I started feeling it after only half a glass,” Sammy said."
0,"“A dryad stomach, eh?"
0,You do look a bit red in the face.
0,"The young miss here seems to be fine, though.”"
0,"“Of course Chloe would,” Sammy sighed."
0,"“Chloe, is the wine strong to you?"
0,"You’ve never drank before, right?”"
0,"Chloe was visibly surprised by the question, unable to follow the conversation."
0,“I don’t really know.
0,I think my body is just burning off the alcohol.”
0,"“I should have guessed,” Sammy said, exasperated."
0,“Is this what you’ve been talking about?
0,I thought the conversation would have been more serious.”
0,“No.
0,I’ll explain everything to you afterwards.
0,Maybe I can convince the Arkhon to make you understand languages too next time I see him.
0,The lingering headache for a few days is definitely worth it.”
0,"“My guess is that Lady Chloe has a fire belly,” Dharin replied."
0,“Am I correct?”
0,“That’s more or less what she said.
0,"At least I’m not as bad as Lemi,” Sammy smiled."
0,“Young Lemi’s not drunk in the same sense as we would be.
0,Alcohol only numbs dryads and makes them sleepy.
0,"If you want to inebriate a dryad, offer them sugar."
0,"The sweeter the better,” Dharin said with a wide smile."
0,“Does that mean that those berries the epimeliad gave me were like the highest-grade alcohol to them?!”
0,“You were presented fruit by an epimeliad?
0,"You are special,” Dharin said."
0,"“If you are to be one of such renown, you should try to build your alcohol tolerance."
0,Those in power will think less of you if you pass out after only a goblet or two.”
0,“Maybe.
0,"Eydis never seemed to get drunk, so that makes sense.”"
0,“As I suspected.
0,You are acquainted with the missing princess.
0,I am most interested in hearing about your story and how you got involved in all this.”
0,“We were more than acquainted.
0,She was my best friend.”
0,Sammy explained her history with Eydis and Jethro’s attack on Gullivan.
0,Her story felt practiced like she was reading from a script because of how often she had given it.
0,She included how she arrived with Chloe and Justin in Fiorrae and the events in Melia.
0,"Because Dharin knew of the sprites’ prophesies, she included that Chloe and Justin were also important to the war according to them."
0,Ceil tensed when Sammy explained the deal made with the Tolmyur commander that brought them to Vallen.
0,"She was terrified to see how Dharin or Kiri would react to hearing that she did not return to fight with them, only to seek Justin’s return."
0,"She felt worse now that she came with such a goal, and the first thing she did in front of the leaders of the resistance was kill someone working to protect the people."
0,"Ceil buried her face in her arms on the table, lacking the courage to look Dharin and Kiri in the eyes."
0,"“Ceil, once you regain your companion, I feel it best that you flee the city,” Dharin said."
0,Ceil’s head shot up from her arms.
0,She looked at the loving gaze of her great grandfather with bewilderment.
0,She was fully prepared to fight in this battle and lose her life if that was her fate.
0,"“If what Lady Sammy says is true, the enemy will be at our gates when Sir Justin is returned."
0,"If he and Lady Chloe are also vital to the approaching conflict, we cannot have them or you die in some inconsequential battle.”"
0,"“You do not know if this battle is inconsequential,” Ceil shouted, rising to her knees."
0,“I am tired of running.”
0,"“No, Ceil."
0,You are tired of living.”
0,Ceil sat back into her cushion.
0,Dharin’s words stole her breath and stopped her heart.
0,"His words rang true, painfully true, and she could not deny them no matter how much she wanted to."
0,"“But, you cannot throw your life away."
0,"I will not lie to you and say the future will be bright or that things will miraculously get better, but what I can tell you is what I have witnessed, that you have friends who love you dearly and who will support you through your darkest moments.”"
0,"Sammy reached her arm around Ceil and pulled her close, resting her head against hers."
0,"“I will not force you to leave,” Dharin continued."
0,“The decision is yours.
0,We may yet survive this battle.
0,"Tolmyur’s campaign has been long, and their soldiers are tired."
0,"Their progress has slowed much in the past days, and they lost many in Nalain."
0,We lack in soldiers but not in numbers.
0,"As much of a fool as Lord Olvor is, he has done well in fortifying his city."
0,"You have until Sir Justin arrives to make your decision, because afterwards, battle will be upon us.”"
0,"“I will think about it,” Ceil said begrudgingly, “but… thank you for telling me all this."
0,I just wish someone would have told me a long time ago.”
0,"Dharin drained his goblet and set it on the table, refusing Kiri’s offer to refill it by placing his hand over the top."
0,“I have enough rooms upstairs for you all to stay.
0,Please treat this old ruin as your home until the time comes when you leave or we do battle.”
0,"“I will call for bed mats,” Kiri said as she headed for the door."
0,“I am sure you would prefer to have some your size.”
0,"Chapter 10
“The Largest Regret”
Sammy"
1,Dharin’s manor had seven rooms on the long hallway of the second floor.
0,The largest room at the back end of the hall belonged to the master of the house.
0,"The others were all similar in size, about 200 square feet."
0,"Kiri was using the room to the left of Dharin’s, and the room to the right was for storage."
0,"The remaining four were decorated and stocked with basic furniture, but none of them had beds."
0,"The bed mats in the storage were only long enough for fairies, but Kiri arrived shortly after dinner was finished with nearly a dozen fairies in toe carrying larger bed mats."
0,"Lemi was laid on one in her own room to sleep off the alcohol, and almost the moment Chloe laid on hers to test it out, she was fast asleep as well."
0,Sammy claimed the room at the front end of the hall across from Lemi’s with a wide window looking out over the garden.
0,"It provided its own fireplace to keep it warm, but Sammy still felt it rather cold, not because the walls and floor were stone but because Ceil decided that everyone would have their own room."
0,"Ceil was in slightly better spirits after the long discussion, having gained a better understanding of her past, but she was still troubled."
0,Her desire for some solitude led to the decision.
0,"Sammy had almost forgotten what it was like to not have someone in her arms or next to her while she slept, so she was not looking forward to the arrangement."
0,"Coby would be there, but he only sat near her head."
0,"She could hold him while she slept, but he wouldn’t be able to sleep like that."
0,Sammy thanked the fairies who laid out her bed mat.
0,"When she sat down on it, she immediately understood why Chloe fell asleep so quickly."
0,The mat was the same material as the small cushions they sat on during dinner but about three times as thick.
0,"Feeling it at this thickness, it was almost the same as contour foam, perhaps even better because no matter how much weight she tried to apply in the heavy gravity, she could not feel the hard floor beneath."
0,"Perhaps they were so comfortable because of the high gravity, and on Earth they would be too firm."
0,The mat was dangerous.
0,"After sleeping on moss and other groundcover for so long, the bed was heaven."
0,"Sammy was excited that for once she might wake up without a bruise on her back, arms, or legs from prolonged contact with the ground in high gravity over the long nights."
0,"The sun was only just setting, painting the overcast sky in red and purple."
0,"Chloe had this incomprehensible ability to sleep as long as she wanted, but Sammy knew that if she went to bed now, she would wake up in the early morning alone and with nothing to do."
0,There were no herbs to gather or campfire embers to rekindle and play with.
0,She could not walk out into the city for fear of someone seeing her without the knowledge that she was with Ceil and attacking her.
0,"Her eyelids were heavy, her head was light, and her body was warm from the alcohol, so it yearned to sleep, but Sammy could not let it."
1,She walked out of her room with uneven steps to the balcony at the front end of the hall.
0,"The stone balustrade was covered with a thick, felt-like moss with a few drooping ferns interspersed along it."
0,"A wooden bench sat along the base of the balustrade, perhaps for the fairies to stand on and look out over the garden."
0,"Sammy giggled imagining frustrated fairies wanting to see into their yard, but the coping sat at eye level blocking their view."
0,"She knelt on the bench and leaned into the balustrade, resting her chin on her folded arms."
0,"“Damn, I’m drunk, aren’t I… "
0,"But, if I can say I’m drunk, does that mean I’m not that drunk?” "
0,Sammy spotted a fairy noble in the distance walking along the wide cobblestone road outside the property.
0,“Hey!
0,Am I drunk!?”
0,"“Yes, you are,” Ceil replied, pushing Sammy’s head back down onto her arms."
0,She then draped a blanket over Sammy’s shoulders.
0,“You really do have a dryad stomach.
0,It is not healthy to be out in the cold after you drink.” 
0,Ceil sat down on the bench.
0,She leaned her head back over the coping and patted Sammy on the back.
0,"Sammy turned on her knees and sat down onto the bench, pulling the blanket around her."
0,"“If I get sick, Lemi will cure me."
0,"And I’ll have you know, alcohol tolerance is determined by your body size and your genetics and your alcohol dehydrogenases in your liver.”"
0,“I do not know what that means.” 
0,“Your stomach has nothing to do with it.
0,That’s what it means.
0,Except Chloe.
0,She’s a fire breathing dragon or something.”
0,“Is she really?” Ceil’s eyes grew wide.
0,"“No, but she could probably breathe fire if she wanted.”"
0,Ceil breathed a sigh of relief.
0,“I would have no way of knowing if there were people on your world who could turn into dragons.
0,That would at least explain Chloe’s power.
0,What is your world like?”
0,Sammy pulled the blanket tight around her.
0,“It’s busy and boring and mean.
0,Everyone is selfish and only thinks about themselves.
0,"You have to work so hard to survive, but the only people who can live rich, carefree lives are those born into it."
0,I would know!
0,I was one of them.”
0,“Were you royalty?
0,Is that why Eydis was with you?”
0,“Maybe as close to royalty as you can get in my country.
0,"My dad owns this huge trade company, so we have more money than we know what to do with."
0,We don’t have kings or queens or empresses or anything like that.
0,And I told you many times.
0,"Eydis lived with Justin, and I met her because I knew him.”"
0,“Was Justin royalty?” 
0,Sammy laughed.
0,“Nope.
0,He is a poor nobody.
0,I’m sure his net worth is twenty thousand or more in debt!”
0,Ceil’s eyes grew wider than they had when she thought Chloe could actually become a dragon.
0,“What?!
0,He’s not royalty or an important political or military figure?
0,Then why was the Tolmyur commander afraid of him?!
0,Why is he important to the war?
0,Why are we going through all this?”
0,“I’m here because I want him back!
0,Not because he is important to whatever the hell is going to happen.” 
0,Tears fell from Sammy’s eyes.
0,"“Sorry,” Ceil backpedaled."
0,“I did not mean it like that.
0,"I just would have thought that… because you said he was Eydis’s lover, he would be royalty or nobility.”"
0,Sammy wiped her tears and looked longingly at the floor of the balcony.
0,“He is rich in ways you can’t buy with money.
0,"Doesn’t change that he’s a dumbass, though.”"
0,"“If your family was so wealthy and he poor, how did you know him?"
0,Why is he everything to you?”
0,“Why are you asking such sobering questions?” 
0,"“You do not look sober,” Ceil said with a flat stare."
0,“Shut up!
0,"I’ve had a lot of shitty relationships, okay?"
0,"Justin’s too, but he was different."
0,"I had just gotten out of an abusive situation, but I didn’t realize it was abusive until the end."
0,"He never attacked me or yelled at me, but he always made me feel guilty for wanting anything."
0,He would ask my opinions but would guilt-trip me if it was anything different than what he wanted.
0,"We always ate what he wanted, went where he wanted, had sex when he wanted."
0,"It got so bad that I felt like I didn’t have a right to have an opinion when it came to us, and I bought into it because I had so much growing up and others had so little, so I had no right to complain."
0,"“When the bastard began telling me that I couldn’t go out with my friends, it was actually Chloe who got mad at me and told me that this was abuse."
0,"I confronted him about it, and he began shouting at me saying that I only wanted everything to be my way, so I decked the fucker and left him."
0,It was only then that I realized how bad off I was.
0,"I felt like shit, evil, like I had wronged him and that all this was my fault."
0,I couldn’t eat.
0,"I skipped work, skipped my university classes."
0,I didn’t sleep.”
0,“And this was Justin?” Ceil looked at Sammy like she was prepared to melt Justin as she had the Rose General.
0,“What?
0,"God, no!"
0,I met Justin two days later.”
0,“Then what was that whole explanation for?” 
0,“Perspective!” 
0,“Your face is too close…” 
0,Ceil sat Sammy back on the bench and urged her to continue.
0,"“I was tired of Chloe asking if I was okay, so I avoided going back to my dorm as much as possible."
0,There is this tiny foyer outside the upper balcony of a seldom used lecture hall in the oldest building on campus.
0,No one goes there.
0,Nobody.
0,"You wouldn’t even know about it unless you had a class in that room large enough to use the upper balcony, and I only ever heard of that happening once, and I was in that class!”"
0,Ceil sighed.
0,“I understand.
0,What about this foyer?”
0,"“I went there to be alone, but someone was there!"
0,Guess who it was.”
0,“Justin?” 
0,“Yes!
0,"I didn’t want to go and find somewhere else to sit alone, so I sat down on the far end of the sofa from him."
0,Do you know the first thing he said to me?”
0,“How could I possibly know that?” Ceil sighed.
0,"“He said, ‘You look terrible.’ "
0,Can you believe that?
0,"Even if it was true, you should never say that to a girl!"
0,I’ll have you know he looked pretty damned depressed himself.”
0,“Why was that?”
0,“I don’t know.
0,"The moment I sat down, everything became about me."
0,He wouldn’t shut up asking what was wrong or if he could help.
0,I went there to be alone because Chloe kept on trying to give me advice.
0,I wasn’t about to ask some stranger for any.
0,"When he asked if there was anything I wanted, I just said the first thing that came to mind."
0,Chocolate.”
0,“What is chocolate?” 
0,“Is this translation thing working?” 
0,Sammy poked her head.
0,“Maybe if I try in Elven.”
0,“You have been speaking Elven this whole time.
0,I do not think it can translate something that there is no equivalent for.”
0,“Whatever.
0,It’s a sweet.
0,Candy.
0,"You have those at least, right?"
0,Please tell me you know what candy is.”
0,"“I understand that much,” Ceil sighed again, exasperated."
0,"“Anyway, I asked for chocolate."
0,He grabs his backpack and removes an unopened variety pack with Hershey’s and Snickers and Milky Ways and whatnot and goes and sets the entire bag in my lap.
0,Who does that?
0,And why the hell was he carrying it anyway?
0,"I mean, he was a little chubby back then, so maybe this was normal for him, but I never saw him randomly carrying around chocolate after that."
0,He wrote his name and number on a piece of paper and handed it to me and said that I could talk with him whenever I needed and then left.
0,Just like that.
0,"“No matter how horrible I felt before, I forgot all of it."
0,I was confused!
0,It didn’t make any sense!
0,I just sat there staring at the hallway like an idiot.
0,So you know what I did?
0,I called him that evening to say I wanted to meet him the next day at his place to talk about what happened.
0,"I returned to my dorm, took a shower, ate, and made sure I was all prettied up to meet him.”"
0,“You wanted to appeal to him just because of confections?” 
0,"“Fuck no!” Sammy shouted, leaning her face into Ceil’s and forcing Ceil to lean back."
0,Ceil pushed Sammy lightly back so she could sit upright.
0,“You are rather vulgar when you are drunk.”
0,"“I’m surprised profanity translates,” Sammy laughed with little care."
0,“Every language has foul words and expressions.
0,It seems yours focuses heavily on feces and intercourse.
0,"It sounds bizarre in Elven, so do not use them in normal conversation.”"
0,Sammy grabbed Ceil’s hand and stared at her with eager eyes.
0,“Teach me elven profanity!”
0,"“No,” Ceil replied with a blank stare."
0,"“Knowing you, you would get yourself into trouble."
0,Continue your story.
0,You beautified yourself before going to meet him.”
0,“Yah!” Sammy returned to her explanation as if the conversation about profanity never happened.
0,"“After what I went through, I was tired of relationships."
0,I was expecting Justin to try and seduce me or ask me out or something because I was depressed or say something like ‘I will treat you better’ or some shit like that.
0,"I made myself as pretty as possible to make it easier for him to do that or make him want to do that, and I was ready to punch him as hard as I could if he did.”"
0,“Did he?” 
0,“No!
0,He acted like I was the same depressed slob I was the day before!
0,Do you know how insulting it feels to go out of your way to look good and have someone not even acknowledge it?”
0,“I am confused.
0,Did you want him to try and seduce you or did you not want him to?”
0,“I don’t know.
0,"I was so used to good looking, confident guys with a fetish for short girls that I didn’t even know what to do at that point."
0,"I pulled out the bag of chocolates, broke it open, and told him what happened like I said I would over the phone.”"
0,"Sammy’s expression softened to the warm longing of a woman in love, and her face flushed redder than the alcohol."
0,Her rapid speech slowed as if she was reminiscing at every syllable.
0,“We talked the entire evening.
0,"He got angry together with me and sad with me, and not once did he try to spin the discussion to his favor to get something out of me."
0,"To him, I was a troubled girl in pain that he wanted to help solely for the purpose of helping me."
0,I was crying by the end and all he did was hold me.
0,"I was so vulnerable in front of him and probably would not have resisted if he tried to force himself on me, but he didn’t."
0,He just held me.
0,That’s all.
0,"I fell so hard for him right there, harder than I had fallen for anyone."
0,"Or maybe, this was the first time I had ever actually fallen in love.”"
0,Sammy wiped a tear from her cheek and chuckled wryly.
0,"“Saying it like that makes me sound like an easy girl, falling in love after a bit of chocolate and kindness.”"
0,“Did you suspect that he was being kind just to make you love him?” 
0,Sammy slowly shook her head.
0,"“I kept in contact with him and tried my best to be as close to him as I could, but he never showed any interest in a relationship."
0,"He never made a move, so one day I asked him instead, but he turned me down immediately."
0,"Can you believe that,” Sammy asked with a self-depreciating smile."
0,“I couldn’t.
0,That had never happened to me before.
0,"I asked if he was already with someone, but he wasn’t."
0,"I asked if he liked me, and he said he did."
0,"I asked if he found me attractive, and he said he did."
0,"But no matter how much I tried to pry the reason out of him, he wouldn’t tell me.”"
0,“So you two were never in a relationship?
0,An unrequited love?”
0,Sammy flashed a confident grin.
0,"“No, I pestered him about it for a month until he caved in."
0,"Once Justin gave the okay, he was all in."
0,Being with Justin was the happiest I had ever been.
0,He went out of his way to make sure I was loved and cared for.
0,"He still had his own life and responsibilities, but he made an effort to spend all his free time with me."
0,"He listened to my opinions and desires, and when we disagreed, he was willing to compromise."
0,"We argued from time to time, but that’s normal."
0,"The only thing our relationship lacked was sex, but I was okay with that."
0,At first.
0,"I mean, I want it as much as any guy would, and I really wanted it from him.”"
0,“I would rather not hear about your bed stories.” 
0,“Don’t worry… Because there are none!
0,Not one.
0,Ever!
0,Every attempt at trying to get intimate he brushed off.
0,Eventually I was upfront about it instead of trying to entice him into sex and he refused me flatly.
0,"I even convinced Sean to leave so that we could be alone, but still nothing would ever happen."
0,"I asked if he was celibate, and that was not the reason."
0,"I asked if he was just abstaining until marriage, and that wasn’t it."
0,"I asked if he was self-conscious about his penis size, but that wasn’t it."
0,"I asked him if he was asexual, but nope."
0,"I even asked if he was actually gay and was just with me because I loved him, but that wasn’t it either."
0,"“He never told me why, so I thought it would be like the month I pestered him about a relationship, but the more I pushed, the harder he resisted until one night I got too forceful and he got mad and left."
0,I was left sitting naked on his couch wondering what was wrong.
0,"When he returned, I apologized and didn’t bring it up again."
0,"I went back to trying to simply be intimate in the hope that he would eventually change his mind, but I felt that a rift formed between us."
0,He became troubled about something and wouldn’t tell me what was wrong.
0,"He started working more, so we spent less time together."
0,"I felt that I had done something terribly wrong, and when I asked, he said I didn’t."
0,“I began questioning what was wrong with me and why he no longer trusted me.
0,"I can be abrasive and unintentionally mean sometimes, so maybe it was too much for him."
0,Maybe he didn’t think I was attractive.
0,Maybe he didn’t like short girls.
0,Maybe he didn’t actually like me but was too nice to say it because he knew I loved him.
0,I started doubting myself and picking myself apart piece by piece.
0,"I wasn’t happy anymore, but I couldn’t tell him that."
0,The rift between us was filling with everything we wouldn’t say to each other.
0,"“He was still doing his best for me and treated me well, even better than before, which made me feel worse, like his kindness was pity."
0,"I started doubting I had any self-worth, and that was when I realized I was beginning to feel the same as I did in my last relationship, but this time I knew it was my fault because it all started when I tried to sleep with him.”"
0,Sammy leaned back against the balustrade and groaned.
0,"“God, I could use another drink."
0,I’m starting to understand why people drink when they’re depressed.
0,Talking about this sobered me up real quick.”
0,"Ceil remained quiet to give Sammy time to collect her thoughts, because her story was clearly not finished."
0,Sammy leaned over and rested her head on Ceil’s shoulder.
0,"“I broke up with him, and it killed me because I saw how much it hurt him, but I couldn’t stand being unhappy anymore."
0,"He never blamed me or questioned my decision, almost accepting it too readily like he knew it was going to happen."
0,"He quit his jobs and became reclusive for a while, but I couldn’t let that get to me."
0,"I forced myself to hate him, to focus on every fault he had to justify my decision."
0,I treated him terribly every time I saw him…”
0,Sammy began to cry from the pain of her guilt.
0,It gripped her heart until her body physically ached.
0,She clung to Ceil’s bind and pressed her face into her chest.
0,"Ceil wrapped her arm around Sammy’s back and stroked her head, unsure how else to comfort her."
0,“Even after all of that… even after I treated Justin worse than shit… he didn’t stop caring about me.
0,He took a bullet for me.
0,He saved my life.
0,I want him back.
0,I want to undo everything.
0,"Tell me,” Sammy looked up into Ceil’s distressed eyes."
0,“Is there something wrong with me?
0,Is there something that you think Justin would hate?”
0,“I feel that any man would be lucky to call you his woman.
0,"Justin is at fault, not you.”"
0,“But Justin did nothing wrong.” 
0,“You still think that after everything you told me?
0,"You truly love him, and that love has blinded you, but…” Ceil rested her cheek on top of Sammy’s head, “Everyone has the right to be blindly in love."
0,"Justin is not perfect, but he does not seem like a bad male."
0,"When you see him, make him tell you the truth and stop hiding things from you.”"
0,“Okay…” 
0,Ceil lifted Sammy off her and looked her in the eyes.
0,“I also have to apologize.
0,I chose this time to talk to you because I felt that you would be more honest when drunk.
0,I wanted to see how you felt about Justin before making my decision.”
0,“About staying for the battle?” 
0,“About you staying for the battle.
0,I have already made up my mind.
0,I will not run.
0,"However, when Justin arrives, I want you to take him, Chloe, and Lemi and escape the city before the fighting starts.”"
0,“What? No!”
0,“Have you even been listening to yourself?
0,"If you truly love Justin, how would you feel if he died in battle?"
0,"If he cared for you enough to take an attack for you that nearly killed him, how would he feel if you died in battle?”"
0,“That’s not fair!” 
0,“Of course it is not fair!
0,Nothing about war is fair.
0,Lemi is an anthousai.
0,She should not even be a part of this.
0,"You, Justin, and Chloe are from another world."
0,You should not be a part of our war.
0,Chloe is right.
0,"If I am so important in what is to come, then I will survive this fight whether the city is saved or lost."
0,I should not die so easily.
0,"But you, you are not important according to the sprites."
0,You could die in this battle like any other soldier or civilian.
0,Do not so easily throw away the life that Justin tried to save.”
0,Sammy’s mouth hung in shock.
0,"She could not form a rebuttal, but she could not accept Ceil’s words either."
0,“I’ll show you too.
0,I will prove that I am important!”
0,"“Then do it by surviving, and the best way to survive is for you to flee."
0,"I have made my decision to stay, so I will offer you the same conditions Dharin offered me."
0,"You have until Justin arrives to choose, but I want you to take that time to give serious thought into your future with Justin in this world.”"
0,“Lady Ceil!” 
0,Kiri appeared from the spiral staircase in the center of the hall and ran towards the balcony.
0,“There is a group of dryads held up at the gatehouse demanding to see you.
0,The refugees are in an uproar.
0,The dryads are protecting a human.”
0,“Is it the minum commander?
0,Have you spotted their army?
0,It is far too soon for them to arrive.” 
0,Ceil stood in panic.
0,"“No, it is a general human."
0,They said his name is Justin and that you would know him.”
0,Sammy sprinted to the stairs and nearly tumbled down them.
0,She raced with unbalanced steps out the door.
0,“Sammy! Wait!” 
0,"Ceil called from the balcony, but Sammy could not hear her over the pounding of her own heart."
1,She sprinted over the cobblestone steps in the ever-darkening twilight.
0,Twice she fell before even reaching the gate of the curtain wall.
0,"Her mind felt clear, but the effects of the wine still had a strong hold on her body."
0,She ran past the guards and down the steps to the lower tiers of the city.
0,Cries rang out from the citizens who spotted a human in their city.
0,They fled and hid in panic or called for the guards.
0,Sammy reached the bridge crossing the lowest tier.
0,"Her mental map was foggy, and she did not know if this was the same bridge she had crossed before, but so long as she crossed and climbed the tiers to the inner wall, she should reach the steps to the courtyard and make it to the gatehouse."
0,She did not care about the fear of the people or the guards quickly rallying to capture her.
0,Justin alone occupied her mind and fueled her adrenaline.
0,“Capture her!
0,Signal the wall!
0,Block the gate!”
0,An orange flare rose into the sky when Sammy reached the second tier.
0,"She could hear boots behind her, but that only fueled her adrenaline."
0,She rose to the first tier and saw five guards blocking the steps up through the inner wall passage to the courtyard and refugee camp.
0,"She had no plan, but her feet would not stop."
0,"If they did, she felt she would collapse from exhaustion."
0,“Let Lady Sammy pass!”
0,A single fairy soared through the air on transparent feathered wings with his long white ponytail fluttering behind him.
0,“Let her pass!” he called again.
0,"The soldiers parted, and Sammy ran up the steps."
0,Dharin flew over the wall and called for the path through the refugee camp to clear.
0,He landed beside Sammy and followed her through the gatehouse.
1,The angry shouts of the refugees outside the wall echoed through the tunnel.
0,A ring of Melians stood their ground against the throng with staves in hand blocking the guards.
0,“Justin!” Sammy’s hoarse voice left the tunnel but was drowned in the cacophony of noise.
0,The Melians saw her approach and brandished their staves.
0,“Let me through!” Sammy screamed in Melian as she approached.
0,“Justin!”
0,“Sammy!” 
0,The healthy voice that called back was Justin’s.
0,"Tears streamed from Sammy’s eyes, and she felt her heart would burst."
0,The Melians heard Justin call back and parted to let Sammy pass.
0,She stopped just outside the ring.
0,"Her hoarse and wheezing gasps tore her lungs and throat, but there stood Justin."
0,He was shirtless and wearing nothing but a coarse green skirt that only revealed his ankles and feet.
0,"His ribs were visible, and his stomach was slightly sunken."
0,"His blond hair was disheveled, and his chin was covered in meager, uneven scruff."
0,"Seeing him standing, he felt to Sammy like a completely different person than the one she helped carry all over Fiorrae and Melia, but the sunburst mark of the bullet wound on his abdomen was the proof of his identity."
0,Sammy’s hand balled into a fist.
0,"With a deep and painful breath, she charged him and swung the strongest haymaker she could, but he didn’t dodge it."
0,She caught herself and tried to pull her arm back before it struck his face.
0,"Her drunken feet tripped over themselves, and she collided into him, knocking them both to the ground."
0,“I said…” Sammy began with tears pouring from her eyes.
0,“I promised I would punch you once you were better.
0,Why didn’t you dodge it?”
0,Justin looked with gentle eyes back at Sammy who knelt on top of him.
0,"Ignoring the red mark on his cheek, he reached up and wiped the tears from Sammy’s."
0,"“With how tired you looked, I didn’t think it would hurt, but you do hit pretty hard."
0,Sorry for worrying you.”
0,Justin sat up and held Sammy as she cried into his chest until Ceil and Kiri arrived.
0,"Interlude
“Earth’s Oracle”
Miriam"
0,Sparse white clouds dotted the clear blue expanse.
0,The air was warm but not too hot.
0,"Beautiful late-summer days like this were perfect for sitting among nature taking in the sights and smells, reflecting on Earth and its beauty, and thinking deeply about one’s place in it."
0,"Nature had a rejuvenating power within it that so few understood, but every individual was connected with that power."
0,"It flowed into them as thoughtlessly and easily as an unconscious breath, and it provided life and health to their minds and bodies."
0,"Even if someone had never heard of or believed in this natural energy, the belief in a “nature recharge” where one can feel reenergized by spending time in the outdoors was not uncommon."
0,"When Justin first taught Eydis the English word for this energy, he used mana."
0,"The term originated in Polynesian and other Pacific Islander religions and was a sacred power earned by or inherent in locations and people, providing them with power and authority and enabling the use of supernatural feats."
0,"Although there were parallels in its definition, the freely abundant nature of the energy was not fully expressed in traditional mana."
0,"The Chinese qi was closer in its claim to be a life force present in every living individual whether plant or animal, but it often lacked the belief in the manifestation of supernatural power that mana professed."
0,"Almost every culture in the world had some belief in the mind, spirit, nature, or faith that could attribute in part to this ever-present natural force, but none understood its true and complete nature."
0,Elves had a term for it: ven.
0,"By literal definition, it meant “flow.” "
0,"Although Miriam did not understand the history or reason for why it was given this name, she felt a detachment with the energy when referring to it by any of the cultural terminology of Earth."
0,"Her grandmother simply referred to it as nature and the elements, and although her grandmother could recognize the energy and had a strong personal connection with it, she could not use it."
0,"Miriam could manipulate the energy because of Eydis’s instruction, and she felt it strongest when she understood it as ven and nothing else, but she lacked the personal connection."
0,"Ever since the disaster at Gullivan, Miriam questioned her connection to this natural energy that she knew was the source of her grandmother’s predictions."
0,"After learning to feel and control her ven, she began hearing faint voices, but they were rare, brief, and none could be considered a prophecy."
0,They were only simple and vague directions.
0,An underlying feeling of guilt burdened her heart.
0,"She felt that if she had a better connection, she could have predicted the attack or perhaps could have known the best course of action to take, and maybe--just maybe--Sammy, Chloe, and Justin would still be alive."
0,"She spent every free day meditating, but this proved difficult in the city."
0,"Both Eydis and Symra said that ven was present even in cities, but Miriam could not feel it."
0,"It was there, because the ven in her body replenished while she slept in her apartment or worked with Eydis and Sean at the Pentagon, but it was elusive."
0,"Ambient ven was easiest to feel in nature, but living in such a dense city, nature was difficult to find, especially where it was peaceful enough to meditate uninterrupted by the noise of Washington D.C. tourists and workers."
0,The hectic summer influx made this even more difficult.
0,"Thankfully there was a memorial park within walking distance from the Pentagon, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove."
0,"It was less visited than the more famous capital landmarks or memorials and was partially forested, making it ideal."
1,Miriam knelt beneath a dogwood with her eyes closed and hands clasped lightly in her lap.
0,She zoned out her sense of sound and focused on the smells of nature and the gentle warm breeze.
0,"At first, all she saw was darkness or the faint glow of the sun as it scattered through the trees and hit her closed eyelids, but soon she could recognize the presence of the ground around her and the trees beside her."
0,"The plants did not have a definitive shape, but there was an essence with an undefinable color that could only be viewed with the mind’s eye."
0,The energy of the trees and grass had a pulse that reverberated through the air and resonated with the pulse of other lives.
0,"Even the ground had shape and form in the darkness, and the energy was firm."
0,"It tremored with the movement of people and vehicles, and Miriam could feel where they were as if their footsteps were the heartbeat of the soil."
0,"If she focused, she could almost count the number of visitors who walked the forested paths."
0,"Miriam found the most strength in the energy of the earth, attributed by her affinity to it, but even though the energy resided in the earth, it was no different than that of the plants or the energy of the wind that flowed like particles of dust in the breeze."
0,It was all the same ven and part of the same connected flow.
0,Or so she thought.
0,Miriam felt a dense gathering of the particles that flowed with the breeze around her.
0,"They were not so much particles of energy but a cloud; or perhaps if the ven she normally felt while meditating was vapor, this strange ven was water, condensed into a completely different form."
0,"It circled her once, then twice, and stopped in front of her at eye level."
0,It took almost a human shape and waved what may have been an arm.
0,She opened her eyes and shrieked.
0,A translucent teal woman hovered naked in the air in front of her face.
0,Her hair flowed freely in the breeze almost as if submerged in a slow-moving current.
0,She smiled sweetly at Miriam with the proud face of a mother admiring her child.
0,“You can see me.
0,"You probably could have seen me for a few weeks now, but I was tied up elsewhere with my responsibilities to Kalya."
0,"If you want to meditate, might I suggest moving to the field?"
0,"It was designed specifically for the rejuvenation of spirit, and I must admit that they knew what they were doing when they created this park."
0,"You will find meditation much easier there,”"
0,“That voice.
0,You were the one speaking in my mind.
0,Are you what my grandmother called the wind?”
0,The woman smiled wider.
0,"“Mabel was such a dear soul, and she always regretted being unable to instruct you properly, so I must express my gratitude to Eydis FeAmel for fulfilling the role as your teacher.”"
0,“What are you?” 
0,“Mabel spoke true.
0,I am the north wind.
0,"Her mother and her mother’s mother, all throughout your maternal ancestry, have acted as my oracles."
0,"We always speak to one who listens, and no matter the change in time and culture, your ancestors have always lent us an ear.”"
0,“Then there are more of you?” 
0,"“There are four of the wind, fifteen of the earth, two of fire, and seven of water."
0,"We are the elements tasked with maintaining the balance of this world, although I do feel sorry for the two of fire."
0,They are overworked trying to keep your planet from overheating.
0,Kalya’s obsession with the rapid advancement of your species does come with some ill side effects.”
0,Miriam remembered the personification of the elements taught her by her grandmother.
0,“Are you a Sylph?”
0,“Theophrastus--or is he better known as Paracelsus?
0,"He did give us that name, but again I feel sorry for fire."
0,Salamanders have always been viewed as monsters or animals despite looking no different than you or I.”
0,“Do they each have an oracle they communicate with?” 
0,“No. Only one is given this duty.
0,"I am the speaker, and you are my oracle."
0,"You may refuse the role if you so desire, and I will be forced to find another.”"
0,Miriam shook her head.
0,Her heart welled with relief that she could not contain.
0,A tear curved around her wide smile as it ran down her cheek.
0,She had never felt happier.
0,“I’ve been trying so hard to follow in my grandmother’s footsteps.
0,I kept doubting myself.
0,I didn’t think I was good enough.” 
0,She nodded enthusiastically.
0,"“Yes. Yes, I will be your oracle."
0,I only wish that I could have been worthy before the attack on Gullivan.”
0,"“Even though your mind was closed off to me and made it hard for me to speak to you, the event happened as it should.” "
0,"“Then Sammy, Chloe, and Justin… I couldn’t have done anything for them?” "
0,“Nothing will come from worrying about them now.
0,There are far more pressing matters.
0,"As my oracle, I must give you a warning."
0,Eydis FeAmel is following a dark path that will see to her ruin and the loss of many lives.
0,She must return to how she once was if we are to survive the coming calamity.”
0,“Before she was captured by the doppelganger?
0,How am I supposed to do that?
0,Justin and Sammy were a major part of her life back then.”
0,“That is for you to discover.
0,I have already interfered too much in these events.
0,"The more we interfere, the less accurate our predictions become, the more blind to the future we grow, and Kalya would be angry if she knew we were overstepping our responsibilities.”"
0,“Who is Kalya?” 
0,"“I apologize, but I cannot answer that question."
0,I have high hopes for you.
0,You are the first oracle in a millennium who can use magic.”
0,The Sylph flitted to Miriam’s forehead and kissed her lightly before vanishing.
0,Miriam stared blankly in front of her almost wondering if what she saw and heard was a dream.
0,"Her heart bubbled with excitement, and when her adrenaline peaked to bursting, she stood and sprinted back to the Pentagon, bounding with each stride."
0,"Chapter 11
“The Itian Struggle”"
1,The six days were up.
0,General Bregon ordered the closure of the conscription camp for the second time in grave disappointment.
0,The food cost for the six days had been equivalent to the food gathered by Captain Kolbur in Simydia.
0,"The amount was small compared to the haul of other conscription forces, but it was a terrible waste nonetheless."
0,"He lost the gamble on the possibility that the Kissiae would join their cause, at least for now."
0,"Traveling to and from the proposed location of Elos should have taken only four days from the camp’s location, especially for a platoon as small as the one Kolbur requested."
0,"If Kolbur fell in battle with hostile dryads, nothing could be done, but there was still the possibility of delay."
0,"With the speed of his small platoon, they would catch up depending on how mobile the kissiae were."
0,"“Move out!” Bregon hollered, and the deafening thunder of boots roared across the forest."
0,His soldiers kept to the thin road in fifteen men or three handcart spans.
0,"Fire mages lined the edges, spaced out evenly where possible."
0,"The nearly 90 thousand conscripted dryads followed the march on both sides of the road, walking uninhibited through the forest underbrush."
0,"The evenly spaced fire mages were a warning to those who might think of rebelling, and the dryad-pulled handcarts piled high with preserved dryad were a constant reminder of what would happen to them if they rebelled."
0,This did not relieve the constant fear pricking the back of each soldier’s mind.
0,"The soldiers may have fire, but many felt that the dryads could eliminate their entire army if they collectively rebelled, although at the loss of many of their own."
0,The hostile Fenda province was next on their path.
0,"The Fendamai already killed a thousand soldiers, so Bregon was prepared for immediate confrontation."
0,Five-thousand dryads led the march as a shield against ambush.
0,Another 5000 took up the rear to prevent an ambush from behind.
0,"Dryads were silent killers, but only against other races."
0,A dryad skilled in life magic would be able to detect the stealthy approach of another dryad.
0,Bregon preferred to avoid conflict if possible so that they could expedite their march and save all able bodies for the vital battle in Vallen.
0,"He hoped the protective cage of dryads around his four-mile train of soldiers would be a powerful deterrent, and it was, at least through the Fenda province."
1,"The march halted on the border between Fenda and Itia where the dense red maples suddenly changed to lush, drooping willows."
0,"Bregon, who stood at the head of his soldiers, demanded from the protective shield of dryads to know why they had stopped."
0,"A pale-skinned dryad, a Simydian, weaved through the dryad barrier for Bregon."
0,"“General Bregon, forgive us."
0,A large number of Itians have blocked the road.
0,They refuse us passage.”
0,“Define large.”
0,“Multiple thousand.” 
0,A few thousand would not threaten his army.
0,He could easily overpower the Itians with his dryads alone.
0,“Are they armed?”
0,“No.” 
0,Lack of weapons did not mean they were harmless.
0,"Although elemental magic was impossible for dryads, they still excelled in life magic."
0,"“Push through, but do not attack unless they do, and do not let any through your perimeter."
0,We will force them to part from the road.”
0,The Simydian reluctantly returned to the forward perimeter to relay the message.
0,"Bregon waited, and eventually the forward dryads advanced at quarter pace or slower."
0,He grumbled to himself.
0,"If this was to be the rate going through Itia, his army would take ten days to reach Melia."
0,"Melia was the largest of the Dhuillir provinces, and although it was much wider than it was long, at quarter march, traversing it would take fifteen days."
0,"Perhaps eliminating them would be quicker, but then he might have to fight his way through Itia, potentially costing more time and resources, and their aggression would give reason for the dryads under the hamadryad’s influence to rally against him."
0,"Traveling through hostile territory was a precarious situation, so erring on the side of caution was the best choice."
0,For now.
0,"Bregon decided to tolerate the quarter march, hoping that once the Itians were diverted to the side, the march would speed up if only a little."
0,"* * *
“We are stalling them as much as possible, but the estimates from the Fendamai were grossly miscalculated.”"
0,“What are their numbers?” the hamadryad asked.
0,"“Twice or more, 120 to 150 thousand.”"
0,"The hamadryad’s smooth brow furrowed, creating the first creases in her newly youthful skin."
0,"If Tolmyur was sending 150 thousand, or even if only 120 thousand, once combined with the forces currently in Vallen, Tolmyur’s total army may outnumber all the fairies remaining in Vallen, including untrained civilians and children."
0,"Ceil ordered her to prevent conflict to save the dryads from the war, so she was focusing on stalling the army with minimal aggression, but with such a large army, she could not let them pass."
0,"Such would be a death sentence for Vallen, Ceil, and Ceil’s companions."
0,“Jenae. Seiva.”
0,"“What do you require,” Jenae asked, standing between the thick roots beside the entrance to the hollow."
0,"She and Seiva, the former village matriarch’s aid, had taken the roll of the hamadryad’s attendants."
0,“We will make preparations for war.”
0,"Seiva’s eyes grew wide, and Jenae knelt to the ground, bowing deeply."
0,“I cannot communicate with Melians outside my influence.
0,"Send messengers to seek them out and exile them to the east, out of the path of the approaching army."
0,I will inform the other villages to do likewise.
0,We cannot let them join the enemy’s forces.
0,"Expect some resistance, but they fear Tolmyur more than they support them."
0,They should cooperate.
0,Also… exile all anthousai and younger with them.”
0,"Seiva was confused about the second order, but Jenae looked up at the hamadryad from her subservient posture with terror in her eyes."
0,“Then it has come to this?”
0,"“With the exiled, some Melians will survive."
0,I apologize for using your people to this end.
0,We will fertilize Melian soil with the bodies of Tolmyur and our kin.
0,Lady Ceil and her companions must survive.”
0,"The hamadryad relayed the message to all matriarchs of Melia under her influence and received similar shocked responses, but she did not have time to elaborate or justify her order."
0,"As the eldest of the dryads within her influence, her word was absolute to those who followed her, but that did not remove the free will of others."
0,"She felt a slight decrease in the hearts connected to her in Melia, but the number was not enough to hinder the exile."
0,The Melians would know who of their kin were connected and who were not.
0,"Those who rejected her would survive, so she could not fault them."
0,Such extreme measures were needed because the army would travel through Melia.
0,"In the other provinces under her influence, her orders were more lenient."
0,She contacted every matriarch through her connection to them and requested any dryads who were willing and able to travel to Melia with haste and prepare for war.
0,"Dryads could travel far faster than a human army due to their incredible stamina, so she hoped a large number would arrive in time."
0,"Although Melia was the largest territory in Dhuillir, their villages were few and spread far, making their population one of the lowest."
0,"Melia had no hope of stopping the army on their own, and if none answered her call, they would at least reduce the number of soldiers arriving in Vallen at the cost of the lives of the Melians who remained."
0,It was fortuitous that the Tolmyur commander had swayed many Melians against her.
0,"Indeed, no matter the outcome, some Melians would survive."
0,"“Grandmatriarch, Itia will aid in your struggle, but some of us will not be joining you in Melia."
0,We will fight them here.”
0,“You have no hope of defeating them on your own.” 
0,"“If we leave, you will not have time to gather the tribes.” "
0,"“Those of us closest to Melia will join you there,” replied another Itian matriarch."
0,“The rest of us along the road will stall as long as possible.
0,We are stronger in our own lands.”
0,“May you be blessed with victory.” 
0,"“Shouldn’t you be saying something like, ‘May your sacrifice not be in vain?’” spoke a far younger voice, a matriarch of a new village."
0,“It’s not like those of us holding them back will come out of this alive.”
0,"“Thank you for your sacrifice,” the hamadryad said, rephrasing her previous statement."
0,Pride welled in the hamadryad’s bosom.
0,"The youth did not fear death, and their courage would be the fiber strengthening the will of the resistance."
0,"In these perilous times, it was the youth who were building the future."
0,"Even Ceil, the young empress, was shouldering the fate of the Amelian Empire."
0,"The hamadryad was unable to communicate with her, but the staff in Ceil’s hands cut from her own branch relayed the message that Ceil was still alive."
0,"However, the powerful malice she recently felt flow through the staff was worrisome."
0,I pray that you stand tall against the storm’s wind.
1,"* * *
Meera looked into the worried eyes of her thirty-three young sisters."
0,"They were unable to hear the hamadryad’s voice, but they heard Meera’s reply, that they would be sacrifices in this war."
0,She rubbed the long willow boughs that sprouted from her head and hung down to her ankles.
0,“That about explains the situation.
0,"The army will be upon us by evening, and our lot has fallen on holding them back.”"
0,"“Meera, you should flee.” "
0,“We cannot make you fight.”
0,Meera shook her head.
0,“What matriarch leaves her sisters to die in her place?”
0,“But your daughter!” 
0,Meera placed her hand on her lightly bulging stomach and smiled.
0,“Are you not all daughters to your mothers?
0,Whether I am with child or not makes no difference.
0,How many fairies have lost their children?
0,"How many mothers with child have been slaughtered by Tolmyur in Vallen, in Amel?"
0,"I have a purpose here, and my daughter shares with me in that purpose."
0,I will at least take two soldiers with me.
0,"One for me, and one for her.”"
0,"The girls exchanged pained glances in silence, unable to say more."
0,"“But, what can the few of us do?” asked the youngest, a girl just beginning to blossom into an anthousai."
0,“It’s Tolmyur’s fault that they extended the road through our village.
0,They have no right to be angry if we remove it.” Meera scratched her head and looked around at her sisters.
0,"“I’m not a shaman, so I cannot be sure, but how many trees can we uproot with the total ven of our village.”"
0,"“One acre. Two if we meditate intermittently,” replied the village shaman."
0,"“That few… Hele, you are the fastest."
0,Other villages should be heading to the road to prepare their own defenses.
0,Send them here.
0,Our village will be the battleground.”
1,"* * *
The quarter march sped up to a third march, easing some of Bregon’s worries."
0,Twice an Itian tried hiding among the branches of the willows but was discovered by the dryad shield and promptly eliminated.
0,There were never any attacks.
0,There was never any aggression.
0,The Itians solely held their ground and pushed back against his advance.
0,"Normally this would be no cause for worry, but Bregon’s military instinct told him something nefarious was at work."
0,"If the Itians were solely against Bregon entering their lands, then his army had long passed that point."
0,The most reasonable choice then would be to grant passage so they could leave Itia as quickly as possible.
0,"Instead, they kept their resistance."
0,"The only explanation was that they were stalling, but stalling to what end?"
0,"The overcast sky dimmed with the sun that had long set over the horizon, casting deep shadows over the willow forest, and the road almost disappeared in the distant dark."
0,"At Bregon’s height, he could just barely see over the barrier of dryads to the Itian resistance, and soon the resistance was swallowed into the dark."
0,The vanishing road was no illusion.
0,"“Halt the march!” he bellowed, and the thunder of boots ceased in a cascading echo down the four-mile train."
0,"His dryad wall stopped, and the few remaining Itians at the front disappeared into the darkened forest where the road should have been."
0,This was a trap.
0,“Where is the road?” 
0,"Bregon called to the Simydians at the front, and the same former messenger weaved through the throng to answer, or at least he thought it was the same."
0,They all looked alike to him.
0,"“Sir, the road is still there, but trees have been transplanted on it."
0,"They are densely packed together in a long wall wider than our advance, including the dryads on the perimeter."
0,"Your soldiers will have difficulty maneuvering through them, and your carts will be unable to pass.”"
0,“Any sign of movement from the Itians?” 
0,“None. They wait behind the tree wall.”
0,"“If they were able to transplant the trees, you should be able to remove them, correct?” "
0,The Simydian nervously plucked a heart-shaped leaf from the long boughs of her hair.
0,"“We could, but I feel there would be no end."
0,"As we clear them, they could be setting more in our path, although we cannot hear such work currently.”"
0,Waiting for the dryads to clear the trees would reduce his march to a standstill.
0,"This was no longer a territorial dispute; it was supply chain obstruction, a form of hostility no different than an organized attack."
0,Bregon sent the Simydian back to the front to inform the forward dryads to pull away from the tree wall.
0,He then raised his hand to give the signal to draw weapons.
0,"The dryads surrounding the road were not knowledgeable about Tolmyur hand signals, but once they saw the soldiers preparing for combat, they placed their hands on the trees and fashioned their own bows, spears, and staves."
0,"“One hundred fire mages to the front,” Bregon ordered to one of his captains who then ran back along the road to flag the fire mages forward, totaling nearly half of the fire mages remaining under his command."
0,"As the fire mages gathered, the other soldiers shifted back to make room on the narrow road."
0,"“Ready hailfire,” he ordered quietly."
0,The one hundred mages raised their hands to the sky facing forward but without any prepared flame.
0,He then approached one of the forward dryads.
0,“Are the Itians still there?”
0,"She ran to the front, confirmed, and returned to report."
0,They were.
0,Marching through a burnt forest would be faster.
0,“Fire!”
0,"Thousands of small fireballs shot from the mages’ fingertips in a wide and scattered arch, raining devastation upon the forest."
0,The tactic was meant to lay waste to villages and draw enemies out of their fortifications.
0,"It was less effective on armored infantry, stone fortifications, and forests where much of the flora was wet and green, but of the sheer number of projectiles some were sure to catch, and any dryads caught in the hailfire would be dealt incurable damage from the flame."
0,The first volley was followed by a second and then a third without the slightest break between.
0,The conscripted dryads watched in fear and awe at a form of magic they felt was specifically designed for their ruin.
0,Many secretly felt that they had made the correct choice in joining Tolmyur instead of opposing them.
1,"A wide grin spread across Bregon’s face as the orange and red glow of flame spread in the dense forest, but his grin quickly faded as an unforeseeable rain fell upon him and his army next."
0,Bregon thrust his spear into the air and caught a falling body.
0,The Itian impaled herself half-way down the haft and gripped it tight as her life sap ran onto his gauntlets.
0,"She tried to use life magic through the wood, but there was no life remaining in it to act as a conduit."
0,"Bregon flung the Itian to the side into the forest where the waiting dryads would finish her, taking caution to avoid her long hair."
0,“Cowls up!
0,Do not expose your skin!” he ordered.
0,His men acted with haste to pull the cowls at their necks up over their noses as dozens of Itian’s rained down on them from above.
0,"Their bodies were barely visible in the dark sky, only being lit by the fire spreading through the forest behind them and what little sunlight filtered up from below the horizon."
0,"The Itians collided with the soldiers and the trees with a jarring crunch as their arms and legs broke from impact, but this damage was minimal to a dryad."
0,"They sprung up and clawed at the soldiers with their hands or attacked with their spears, attempting to reach the soldiers’ faces or pry open any gap in their armor where life magic could fatally wound through contact with the skin."
0,The Itians who landed without injury spun in wild dances using their long hair as whips.
0,Even the slightest contact with the long and slender leaves on the boughs of their hair caused flesh to rupture.
0,The unarmored dryads were most susceptible to the caustic dances of the Itians.
0,"Lacking bladed weapons, they could only block the hair with their staves and spears and impale the Itians to the ground."
0,"Those skilled with life magic then ended the Itian’s life, and when one Itian excelled in life magic, two or three dryads were needed to overpower the difference in ability."
0,"The swordsmen on the path scrambled to protect the lightly armored mages from the raining Itians, cutting the long willow boughs and dismembering their arms to remove any ability to attack."
0,"The mages, when able, continued their hailfire into the forest beyond, their innumerable miniature fireballs colliding with the Itians who appeared to fly over the burning forest."
0,"Bregon swung his spear with masterfully practiced motion, knocking the falling Itians aside or cutting through them with his long, broad-leafed spearhead, showering those around him in the thick and bitter sap."
0,"Bregon’s anger built, but he refrained from showing it."
0,His composure was the composure of his army.
0,"If he faltered, so would they."
0,The source of his anger was the unfathomable tactic employed by the Itians.
0,His protective wall of dryads was meaningless against attacks from above.
0,"He expected a rain of dryad arrows, but Itians did not appear to employ such weaponry."
0,"Instead, they used their own bodies, but how?"
0,"What sorcery are they employing, Bregon grumbled in his mind as he eviscerated a withered old Itian before she could land on the minum fire mage beside him."
0,“Earth mages to the front!”
1,"* * *
Meera grabbed a handful of soil and smeared it on the burning cinders that ate deep into her sister’s back and shoulder."
0,"They had transplanted most of the willows starting from her village and continuing down the road to create a seven-acre wide, thick tree wall, but that left the gathering of the thousands of dryads exposed in the open dirt field and susceptible to the countless fireballs raining down on them."
0,"The first few volleys were so thick that few remained uninjured, including her, and those who could not smother their flames curled up on the ground to burn so that their death would not spread to others."
0,"The tree wall was burning, and the thick smoke wafted downwind to them."
0,"Dryads could survive without breathing for long periods of time, but they would weaken, and being night, they were already weaker than they would be under the sunlight."
0,"“You should fall back,” Meera suggested to the young girl, but she shook her head."
0,"“If I am injured, I should be next to go.”"
0,Meera’s heart sank.
0,"The pink blossoms of the girl’s hair were just beginning to bloom full down the long boughs, but many were now singed and blackened from the fire and smoke."
0,"The young anthousai looked up at her with tearful eyes full of determination, and Meera could not deny the girl."
0,"They were the sacrifices so that the dryads could gather against Tolmyur, sacrifices so that their young empress would not be overwhelmed."
1,Meera lifted the girl and led her through the sparse hailfire to one of the willow trees they kept in the field.
0,Three shamans knelt with their hands on the trunk.
0,"The willow bent back in an unnatural arc, and six Itians clung to the long boughs, pulling them taught."
0,The anthousai gripped a handful of boughs with one arm and was handed a spear for her other hand.
0,"Being so young, she was unable to make use of life magic for combat."
0,"Seeing that no others gathered, the shamans snapped the willow forward, flinging the seven Itian’s through the smoke over the burning tree wall and into the unseen army."
0,The shamans quickly worked to repair the damage to the trunk from the quick snap and  bent it back again for more Itians to gather at the boughs.
0,There was no way to know through the smoke and fire just how many of the soldiers and dryads had been defeated.
0,Already half of their thousands of Itians had succumbed to the hailfire and multiple hundred had been thrown over the wall into the enemy.
0,"“Fall back to the second line,” an elderly matriarch of another village called out."
0,The second tree wall was finished.
0,"This devastation would repeat again, and if possible, a third time."
0,"Meera looked around for the sisters of her small village, five already laid charred on the ground and an unknown more had thrown themselves into the enemy."
0,She saw no faces that she knew in the fiery chaos.
0,"“Fall back,” the matriarch called again."
0,"A fireball impacted the matriarch’s chest, blooming into flame."
0,"Meera ran towards the matriarch, scooping up a handful of loose soil from the uprooted trees, but before she could reach her, the ground rumbled, and the snapping of wood cried above the crackling of the fire."
1,Meera turned towards the tree wall to see large mounds of rock and earth upheaving the burning trees and forcing them aside.
0,"Multiple gaps in the wall opened, and all at once, dryads and soldiers flooded in."
0,The shamans tasked with throwing the Itians over the wall quickly climbed their willows.
0,"Those unable to skillfully use life magic picked up the prepared spears, making room for the shamans on the ground who readied their dances."
0,The life magic that ate away flesh would affect both friend and foe alike.
0,"Meera picked up a spear in each hand, holding them mid-haft with the back of the haft cradled in her armpits."
0,"The traditions of the Itians were rooted in dance, and that included combat."
0,"Itian spears were shorter than most but would still be unwieldy and inhibit combat for other races when dual wielded; however, for an Itian, they became an extension of an Itian’s body that followed with every graceful movement."
0,"Two staves were used in most traditional dances, but when replaced with spears, they became lethal talons that both extended beyond their hair and could direct their hair where the motions of their head could not."
0,"A Simydian approached with a long spear in hand, and using her forward hand as a support and fulcrum, her back grip thrust the spear forward in many quick jabs."
0,Meera paid little attention to the few jabs that punctured her chest and shoulders.
0,"She spun her arm, locking the long spear between her shorter spears, and whipped her hair forward to block visibility."
0,"With a step and twist, she wrenched the spear upwards, but the Simydian retracted her spear and thrust it again."
0,All it hit was hair.
0,"Meera was beside her, and using the Simydian’s spear as a lever, she flipped her over her back and impaled her on her own spear."
0,"Meera grabbed the haft and thrust it into the ground, pinning the Simydian."
0,"That alone was not enough to kill her, but the spear was deep into the soil and would hold her for a while."
0,Meera had no interest in dryads.
0,She was after the humans.
1,She spotted a lone fire mage near the tree wall that stood back throwing lethal flames over the melee.
0,Quick feet carried her over the loose soil.
0,She slid beneath the wide fan of an Itian shaman’s boughs and weaved through the preoccupied dryads with graceful motion.
0,The minum spotted her and threw a fireball which she swatted away with the butt of her spear.
0,"It exploded, but the heat only singed her."
0,She broke through the flames and bounded in an aerial cartwheel over the minum.
0,The minum ducked below the following swing of her spear with a fireball ready.
0,"Meera knocked his arm aside with the next twist of her body, sending the explosive flame into the dryads flooding through the wall."
0,"The accompanying spear in her other hand finished the dance with a thrust through his heart, uninhibited by the light leather armor."
0,"“One,” Meera sneered."
0,A searing pain spread through her lower back to her stomach.
0,She looked down and saw a broad-leafed spearhead wider than her arm.
0,She dropped her spear and grabbed the haft protruding from her back and glared at the one who held it.
0,It was a giant in crude plate armor that only one of his strength could wear in battle.
0,The giant lifted her on the spear head and swung her forward.
0,The blade cut out through her side and sent her soaring over the melee into a crumpled heap against the trunk of a willow.
0,Her lower body tore out at a right angle with the sap and fluids of her stomach muddying the soil.
1,"The dryads pursuing the Itians who fled to the second wall ignored her for dead, but a lone swordsman caught the seething whites of her eyes."
0,He approached to execute what the giant’s spear failed to kill instantly.
0,"The steel blade reeled back to remove her head, but the boughs of the willow ensnared his arms and eroded his skin."
0,A lone shaman remained on the branches.
0,"The boughs lifted him by his ankles as a fireball impacted the willow’s canopy, engulfing the shaman in flames."
0,"Before the boughs could release the soldier, Meera thrust her spear through his eye."
0,"“And that one is for my daughter,” she sneered as the loose boughs dropped him to the ground."
0,Meera leaned her head back against the trunk of the willow and watched the burning leaves and branches fall around her.
0,"Her wound was too severe to heal, and she would burn down with the willow, but a smile spread across her face."
0,She had accomplished her goal.
0,“Long live the Amelian Empire.
0,Long live our young Empress.”
1,"* * *
Bregon looked at the devastation in the dirt field beyond the fourth tree wall."
0,"There were only about two hundred Itians remaining, but like any cornered animal, they were the fiercest of them all."
0,"The long night of combat was over, and the light of the morning sun was creeping over the horizon, although the sun itself had yet to show its face."
0,"He estimated about five to six thousand Itians in total had gathered to hinder his advance through Dhuillir, and due to the bizarre tactics that allowed the Itians to fly over their defenses, tactics that he still could not figure out, nearly two thousand of his own soldiers were slain."
0,"For his overwhelming difference in strength and number, this was a humiliating loss that enraged him."
0,"“We rest until noon,” Bregon ordered."
0,"“Dryads, heal the wounded, gather the bodies for provisions, and retrieve the handcarts abandoned behind the first tree wall."
0,"Once that is done, feel free to sunbathe and recover your strength.”"
0,"The number of conscripted dryads that had fallen was unknown, but he expected it to be few."
0,"Without bladed weapons or life magic, one dryad killing another was difficult, often leading to prolonged and brutal confrontations that wore away each combatant until one was left in a mutilated heap."
0,"When life magic was involved, higher skill won out, but numbers could potentially overpower skill, and his 90 thousand dryads clearly outnumbered the six thousand Itians."
0,"The last two walls were handled by the conscripted dryads alone to prevent further losses to his army, and the gruesome battles between melee combatants and the slow power struggles between shamans that drained ven until they too were forced into physical combat caused the battle to last the entire night."
0,"If anything, Bregon was amazed that dryad stamina could last so long in all out combat even without their precious sun giving them strength."
0,"Now that the battle was over, Bregon was as certain as he could be that something awaited his armies before he would leave Dhuillir."
0,The Itian resistance was a suicide struggle for time.
0,"The danger was that there was only one road, and his handcarts required him to use it."
0,"If it weren’t for that, he could take his army through the forests to the Itian border with Fiorrae and up north along the Melian border to avoid whatever awaited him."
0,Perhaps that would not be such a terrible idea.
0,Bregon sat on the trunk of a toppled willow and waved down one of the dryads.
0,She approached with haste and bowed before him.
0,“Find me a large number of dryads who are knowledgeable about the sprites.”
1,He sat and waited as the sun peaked out over the willow canopy.
0,"The dryad returned with a depressingly small number following her, eight in total and all elderly."
0,He expected as such because only Itia and Melia bordered Fiorrae.
0,The sprites avoided any conflict with Tolmyur and ignored all demands for surrender.
0,"The few platoons sent to subdue their small numbers were all chased out by the prominent bird of prey in the region, not the sprites themselves."
0,"Never once had an army the size of his approached their borders, so he was unsure how they would react."
0,The sprites were believed to be elementals that also held magical capabilities; a dangerous combination because their elemental attributes would increase their magic power further.
0,“Do any of you know why the sprites have stayed neutral in this war?”
0,The dryads looked to each other as if trying to figure out who knew best to answer.
0,"The eldest dryad with long, grass-like hair and skin the color of a dried reed, an Efkalypiad, stepped forward."
0,"“The Sprites have always avoided involvement with any political affairs, even within the former Amelian Empire."
0,I assume their desire to stay out of the war is related to that stance.”
0,“And yet I heard from a messenger from Melia that they had sheltered the widow of the emperor after she fled Vallen.” 
0,"The dryads again exchanged glances with each other, but none seemed to have an answer."
0,“Do you know how they would react to an army of this size marching along their border or potentially crossing through Fiorrae to enter western Vallen?”
0,"“You mean to avoid Melia altogether,” a Simydian asked."
0,“The battle in Vallen is far more important than the struggles of the hamadryad and her ilk.
0,"If we can avoid a repeat of last night by avoiding Melia, I would prefer to do so.” "
0,Especially if machinations of a far grander scale were being prepared.
0,The Efkalypiad shook her head.
0,"“I can only speak of rumor, but there is one among the sprites who is known as the Arkhon."
0,"All sprites are immortal, undying, but he is believed to be ageless from times long past, before the Amelian Empire was, before the dryads, possibly older than the ancient civilization."
0,You would do best not to make an enemy of such a being.”
0,"Bregon glared at the Efkalypiad for insinuating that he and his soldiers were so weak that they could be threatened by a single individual, but there had always been legends of beings with exceptional power who defy reason."
0,"There were the two titans, Bydrofe and Gyea of the wilderlands, the trow witchdoctor who abducted men who fled north out of Tolmyur through the swamplands, the golem colossus in the caverns deep below the Stollmuk range, the hydra used against his own people during the Coastal Wars, and others."
0,"Even Tolmyur had their own, their Commanding General, but Jethro was missing in action in the other world and could not aid his army."
0,"If this Arkhon was one such being, perhaps angering him would be a foolish decision."
0,"“Even if he is no stronger than you or I,” the Efkalypiad continued, “no weapon or magic can injure a sprite."
0,"If your invasion of their lands draws them into battle, your only hope is to flee from them as they kill you one by one.”"
0,“Are you certain these sprites are immortal?” 
0,"Bregon looked into the eyes of each dryad in turn, and they all answered in the affirmative without deception or guile."
0,"The sprites lived deep inside Fiorrae, so there was a chance that they would not confront his army for just passing through, but if the Efkalypiad spoke true, bringing their ire could result in the inevitable destruction of his army."
0,"Whatever awaited him in Melia could endanger his army, but he had confidence that he would win against the hamadryad’s plot."
0,The choice was between the risk of elimination and the guarantee of loss.
0,"When traveling through hostile territory, it was best to err on the side of caution, and elimination was too grave a risk to take, especially when the campaign in Vallen needed every possible soldier he could provide."
0,Bregon grumbled within himself.
0,He would take his army through Melia.

“The Children of Vallen”
Sammy"
1,Sammy’s hand reached over in her sleep and found warmth.
0,"As if drawn by its comfort, she unconsciously shifted closer to it and wrapped her arm around it."
0,"There was an herbal scent lingering in the warmth, not unlike Lemi’s, but it was faint and overpowered by a nostalgic aroma that made a tear fall from her eye."
0,She squeezed the warmth as her eyes cracked open and saw the slow rise and fall of a bare and nearly hairless chest.
0,"“Justin!” She shot up, and her left hand immediately ran to the sunburst-like scar on his abdomen."
0,"“Good morning,” said a soft voice that caused Sammy’s chest to well up with an emotion that was difficult to describe, a combination of anxiety and elation and confusion and relief."
0,Justin smiled warmly at her.
0,“Is this how you are going to wake up every morning?”
0,"“Old habits,” Sammy said, returning his smile as she wiped the tear trail from her cheek before another could trace its path."
0,She looked longingly at the man who she had cared for and carried for what would have been months on earth while he was too sick to even wake.
0,"He turned to his side and clasped her hand, making her heart beat heavy in her chest."
0,"It was a habit he did not have while they were dating and that he had picked up because of his relationship with Eydis, but Sammy did not mind how it originated."
0,She enjoyed it all the same.
0,"Justin was shirtless, and the blanket covered only his waist and below."
0,"Sammy was also topless, but Justin was not bothered or flustered by it."
0,"Anyone who saw the scene would have suspected that they slept together, and they did, but only in the literal sense."
0,"Keeping with Ceil’s declaration that the four girls should have their own room, Justin was the odd one out."
0,The obvious arrangement was for Justin to share Sammy’s.
0,"She could not deny that waking up with him each morning with them both half naked was terribly arousing, but from past experiences, she was far too scared to act on her desires."
0,"Even if Justin was willing to have sex, Sammy would be the one denying him this time."
0,The reason was that he was still not healthy.
0,"Justin’s stomach and cheeks were rather sunken, and his ribs were clearly visible, but he appeared far better than in her foggy drunken memory of colliding into him at the gatehouse."
0,"Due to Sammy forcing him to eat almost as much as Chloe, which Justin complained about each time because his stomach had shrunken drastically, the meat on his arms now matched the width of the joints in his elbows instead of looking like some old ball-jointed toy."
0,"The best shaman of the entourage of Melians that now resided in the manor’s front garden, the shaman of Lemi’s village, checked up on him twice daily to make certain that there were no issues arising in his rehabilitation and that he would regain his strength and stamina."
0,"The door to the room opened, and Lemi stepped in."
0,"Justin looked away out of respect for the girl, a reaction Sammy always found charming."
0,"Lemi saw them holding hands, and a wide toothy grin spread across her face."
0,"She was the only one who was willing to wake Sammy or Justin or enter the room to greet them first thing in the morning, and seeing them together gave her no shortage of joy."
0,"“Food is almost ready!” Lemi announced with glee before spinning and prancing back to her room to get dressed, leaving the door wide open."
0,"Sammy apologized for Lemi’s childish behavior and lack of modesty at first, but now she could only chuckle lightly to herself."
0,"Justin had spent days traveling with dryads, so he should have grown accustomed to them by now anyway."
0,At least Lemi wore her dava most of the day.
0,These events only happened in the morning right after everyone woke.
0,"Sammy removed her blanket, stood, and stretched her back and arms, not that they ached or were tense from the heavenly bed mat."
0,"With mild consideration for Justin, she turned her back to him while she swapped her night skirt for her dava and then wrapped her breasts."
0,She then helped him up and handed him his skirt.
0,"It was meant for a High Elf, so it was originally quite long for him until Chloe trimmed and hemmed it."
0,Justin did not mind changing in front of Sammy considering she had taken care of him most of the time while he was injured.
0,"She handed him his simple brown robe, which was meant for a heavy-set Fairy so that it fit him around the shoulders."
0,"When tied about his waist with the skirt extending from below, Sammy thought he looked like a monk, and he probably would have further resembled a monk if he hadn’t requested that Sammy ask Dharin for his shaving knife."
0,"Sammy still chuckled remembering how many times Justin nicked himself trying to use it the first morning, especially remembering how much Lemi giggled while she healed him."
1,"The only person absent during breakfast was Kiri who was always off performing her duties as Chief Advisor and Council Head, arguably the highest current ranking official of the fairies, higher even than Lord Olvar and Thorn General Dharin because Kiri was second in authority only to the late Fairy High King."
0,The king’s official successors all died in the fall of the Gallanvale.
0,"After the assassinations and during the subsequent campaign in Vallen, there hadn’t been an opportunity to crown a new king, and the only royal descendants that were known to still live were Dharin and Kiri anyway."
0,"And of course, Ceil."
0,"The breakfast Dharin and Lemi prepared was a modest spread of fruit, cheese, and bread with heavily watered-down wine out of consideration for Justin and Sammy."
0,It became more of a bitter fruit juice than any alcohol.
0,"Even Lemi was able to drink it without much issue, although if she drank too much, she would still take a late morning nap."
0,“Have you come to a decision yet?” Ceil asked Sammy as breakfast wound down.
0,"“Are you going to ask us this every day?” Sammy replied, slightly exasperated."
0,She finished her goblet and leaned back into Justin’s chest to relax her full stomach.
0,"“I know I gave you until Justin arrived to make the decision, but we couldn’t have expected him to arrive with Tyree that same day."
0,"Another village fell yesterday, so that only leaves two more locations until they reach Revlan."
0,You are running out of time.”
0,"Sammy leaned her head back to look up at Justin, but he only looked sorrowfully at Ceil."
0,"She was like a younger sister to Eydis, and she had already decided to stay for the siege."
0,"Justin never voiced his opinion, but Sammy knew that if she asked it of him, Justin would tell Sammy to flee while at the same time opting to stay and help where he could."
0,"But, if Sammy did decide to flee and begged Justin to come with her, she knew he would."
0,Or at least she hoped he would.
0,"The prospect of all-out war and a repeat of what she saw at Gullivan and Nelain terrified her, and that’s what made the decision so difficult for her."
0,"“We haven’t decided yet,” Sammy finally answered, much to Ceil’s annoyance."
0,"“Perhaps a tour of the city and its defenses might help you,” Dharin suggested."
0,“I feel the knowledge of your existence has diffused through the city well enough now that you should be safe to walk outside the curtain wall.
0,"You should still have a few guards with you at all times, which I can provide, and I can offer one of my commanders as a guide to take you wherever you wish to visit to help with your decision.”"
0,“We can finally see the city?” Lemi asked in excitement.
0,“Yes.” Dharin smiled back like a grandfather admiring his adorable granddaughter.
0,“But do not become too depressed when you see that it is more stone than you thought.”
0,“But it is still very green.” 
0,“Only on the upper tiers.
0,It depends on where you want to go.”
0,"“I’ll be fine,” Lemi exclaimed with confidence."
0,"“Where should we go first,” Sammy asked Justin."
0,"“Go?” Justin looked quizzically down at Sammy, and she realized that the entire conversation had been in Elven."
0,"With Dharin present, even Ceil chose Elven over English, and Sammy naturally followed, but this alienated Chloe and Justin."
0,"Sammy felt a bit bad for them, so she quickly explained Dharin’s suggestion."
0,"“I want to see the orphanage,” Chloe replied before Justin had time to think up an answer."
0,"Apparently, the children had been on her mind for a while."
0,"“I can arrange that,” Dharin said after Ceil quickly translated."
0,"“Do not inform them we are coming,” Ceil ordered."
0,“I want to see the city as it is.
0,That goes for wherever else we visit as well.”
0,"Dharin acquiesced, but Sammy noticed his countenance fall slightly."
0,It was not as if he had reason to hide anything.
0,This was a city overflowing with refugees and preparing for an inevitable siege.
0,There was no way everything would be pristine.
0,Would it not be better for their empress to see the truth?
0,Dharin promised to uphold Ceil’s conditions and left to prepare an escort and guide.
1,The remainder of the morning was free as it had been every day.
0,"Tyree came inside with the help of one of the other Melians, Tae, due to her missing leg to check up on Justin."
0,"She was worried about his stamina and whether he would be able to walk around the city, but she also felt that this would be a good opportunity to build his endurance so long as he did not overwork."
0,"From what Sammy heard the day after Justin arrived, after he woke up he was far too weak to walk, so the Melians had carried him most of the way to Revlan, even while he slept through the night."
0,"He had only just grown healthy enough to walk the day he arrived, which was why he could not stop Sammy when she collided into him."
0,He simply did not have the strength.
0,What surprised Sammy the most about the ordeal was that the Tolmyur commander had entrusted Tyree to take Justin to Revlan in his stead while he met up with the army.
0,"Both she and Ceil had assumed that there would be an exchange just before the battle, but Tyree explained that Captain Byurk was trusting Ceil to uphold her side of their agreement."
0,"Of course, by that time Ceil had already decided to stay, and that appeased Tyree."
0,"Tyree was also of the opinion that Sammy should take Justin and Chloe and flee the city before the battle, and she reminded Sammy of this every time she checked up on Justin, adding more pressure on Sammy to make her decision."
1,Dharin returned just before noon.
0,"With nothing else to do, everyone was already prepared to depart and followed Dharin outside without him needing to leave the entryway."
0,The nearly twenty Melians in the garden bowed to Ceil and waved to Justin as they passed.
0,"One of the youngest who looked about fifteen or sixteen ran to the fence and knelt, presenting a pair of green woven sandals to Justin."
0,"“For Sir Justin,” she said nervously."
0,"“Those are for you,” Sammy explained, elbowing Justin in the arm."
0,"Justin was already provided leather sandals, but he promptly removed them and retrieved the girl’s hand-crafted pair."
0,He slipped them on and tied the lace-like vines around his ankles to hold them in place.
0,“You don’t need to keep them on.
0,"Once we are out of sight, you can change back,” Ceil suggested."
0,"“No, I think I’ll wear them."
0,They are far more comfortable.
0,"If they break, then I’ll change."
0,How do you say thank you in Melian?”
0,"“Szeeta,” Sammy replied."
0,Justin knelt by the fence and smiled at the girl.
0,“Szeeta.”
0,"Her elated giggle looked to Sammy like a young girl with a crush, but the concept of romantic attraction did not exist in dryad nature."
0,"From what she heard, these Melians made a similar misunderstanding about Justin that the central Melian village had made about her."
0,"Their empress was willing to go to battle to reclaim Justin from the Tolmyur army, so he had to be a high ranking official or royalty or perhaps Ceil’s lover, which Ceil vehemently rejected."
0,"Once Ceil explained to them that Justin was Eydis’s lover, they made every effort to appeal to him."
0,"After all, if what Ceil said was true, he could become emperor consort to the new Empress Eydis once Eydis claimed the throne."
0,"This was a harsh reality check for Sammy, because even though she desperately wanted Justin to love her and to be hers, he already had Eydis, and who would turn down such a wonderful, strong, intelligent, kind, and beautiful woman who was also the future leader of an empire?"
0,"Eydis’s safety was unknown, but Sammy could never, even in the darkest reaches of her jealous heart, wish that ill fortune befell her best friend just so she could claim Justin as her own after she already had her chance with him and ruined it."
0,"Although, Eydis had expressed shortly before she was hospitalized that sharing Justin with her was a matter of course, even going so far as to state that Sammy had far more right to Justin than she ever could."
0,"Sammy laughed off the exchange back then, but perhaps that was Eydis’s way of telling Sammy to settle her and Justin’s past."
0,Eydis recognized how much Sammy still loved him.
1,Sammy hooked her arm around Justin’s and led him to the cobblestone street.
0,Four High Elf soldiers stood behind Dharin.
0,"Sammy had seen male High Elves before, but none this close where she had time to admire them."
0,They had to be over seven feet tall.
0,Beside Dharin was a female elf in loose-fitting leather armor.
0,"Sammy assumed she was an elf, but she was not like any she had seen before, at least that she could remember."
0,"This elf was about six feet tall and had a curvaceous figure that her loose leather armor could not hide, completely different than the slender High Elves and fairies."
0,"Her short brown hair stuck out straight in all directions, and her long pointed ears with fine brown fur lining the top edge drooped heavily downward."
0,"Her face was lightly freckled, something Sammy had never seen in any race from this world, and her eyes were the most brilliant shade of orange."
0,"“Your eyes are beautiful,” Sammy spoke without thinking."
0,"The corner of the elf’s full lips curled upwards, but she did not speak."
0,Dharin extended his hand beside him to the new elf.
0,"“This is Thanysa, a brier under my command."
0,She will act as your guide.”
0,Thanysa bowed to a perfect right angle.
0,"“I am most honored to accompany you, Empress Ceil, Lady Sammy, Lady Chloe, and Sir Justin.”"
0,"“What’s a brier,” Sammy asked."
0,"“A special operations unit that acts directly under the Thorn General,” Ceil explained."
0,"“They handle counter-espionage and act as executioners for defectors and traitors, but they are mostly used to escort key political figures when not at war."
0,"And she is a Mountain Elf, if you were not aware."
0,"If you remember, they originate to the southwest, south of Fiorrae.”"
0,Sammy was grateful for Ceil’s explanation.
0,"There was one more question lingering on Sammy’s mind, so she posed it to Dharin."
0,“Isn’t this a fairy city?
0,Why didn’t you choose to use fairy guards?” 
0,"Sammy was worried the question might insult the High Elves, but their expressions did not change."
0,"“Thanysa was raised in Revlan, so she is best suited for a guide."
0,"High Elves have a wider range of magical affinities compared to fairies, so they have a wider range of methods to address any would-be threats."
0,"Also, being twice the height of a Fairy, they have a better vantage point over crowds."
0,"If there is nothing else, Thanysa, please escort them to the orphanage."
0,They will inform you of other locations they wish to visit along the way.”
0,“With pleasure.” 
0,Thanysa gave a light bow to Dharin and took her position ahead of the group.
1,The High Elves stood like pillars in the four corners surrounding everyone.
0,"Even though she asked why Dharin did not select fairy guards, Sammy felt far more secure with these towering figures than she would with guards who were as short as her or more often much shorter."
0,"When Thanysa led them out the curtain wall gate, Sammy was surprised by how much the city changed in the days they had been confined to the central district."
0,"The number of people had drastically increased, and most the streets were crowded enough that no one could walk without bumping shoulders with one another."
0,"“Did they let refugees from the camp into the city,” Ceil asked."
0,Sammy was relieved she was not the only one surprised by the seemingly sudden change.
0,"“Originally we only allowed those who had relatives from Revlan who could vouch for them enter the inner wall, or artisans and craftsman and any other trade that would be of use preparing for the war and aiding the masses, but the refugee camp filled to breaking."
0,We had to make more exceptions.
0,Parents with children were permitted.
0,Youth who were willing to work a trade regardless of skill were next.
0,Adults who were combat-able were sent to the soldier camp to the northeast of the city for weapons training.
0,"Eventually, the only people remaining in the camp were elderly, injured, and those who were too psychologically damaged to be of any use, and there are a fair many of those.” "
0,Thanysa’s voice trailed off.
0,"No one could guess what was on her mind, but Sammy felt that if Thanysa was from Revlan, seeing her city in such dire circumstances must have weighed heavily on her."
0,"“If you wanted to see the refugee camp, I would advise against it."
0,"When you place so many mentally weak and unstable in such confines, madness spreads like disease."
0,It is now more of a death camp than a refuge.
0,The elderly are dying of fear and stress.
0,The manic sometimes attack indiscriminately.
0,Those with weak hearts are killing themselves.
0,Even the kindest of souls consider ending their own life to make room for others.
0,"We lose about a hundred a day, and the fighting has not even begun."
0,"At least the flow of refugees is ebbing, but that also means the enemy will be the next to approach our gates.”"
0,"“Thank you for your honesty,” Ceil said."
0,"“At present, we have no plans to return to the refugee camp."
0,"We have seen the gatehouse’s defenses already, and if I need to know more, I will ask.”"
0,“I am grateful for your consideration.” 
0,Thanysa turned and bowed before continuing onward.
1,The dense crowd started only one tier below the curtain wall.
0,The loud tapping of the High Elf guards’ spears signaled the people to part.
0,The guards did not announce Ceil’s presence per her orders.
0,"She did not want any fanfare or to cause undue commotion, but most the city now knew who she was, so calming the crowd would have been impossible."
0,Cries rang out and heated conversation spread.
0,Some praised Ceil while others blamed her for the destruction.
0,"Although word had spread that Sammy, Chloe, and Justin were allies to Vallen, the vilest of the comments Sammy heard were directed at them."
0,"Death, rape, mutilation, torture--all forms of threats were thrown at her in languages and dialects that she was unsure even Ceil could understand."
0,"Perhaps they were speaking in their own ancestral tongues solely to avoid the ire of Ceil and her guard, but Ceil’s steeled face showed that she probably understood a few of them."
0,"Sammy was thankful that Justin and Chloe were not provided the same gift by the Arkhon, and by Lemi’s lack of reaction, she couldn’t understand any of it either."
0,"Sammy understood the citizens’ ire, but that did not stop the anger bubbling up within her, and she struggled within herself to not snap back at the crowd."
0,"If she retaliated in any way, their hatred would be vindicated."
1,"Once Thanysa led them down to the second and then third tier, the crowds grew less angry."
0,Only the higher-class citizens felt justified in their accusations.
0,"The craftsman and other labor force acknowledged the guarded escort, but they did not break from their toils."
0,This was Sammy’s first view of the lowest tier.
0,"It was crowded and filthy, and there was no vegetation to be seen, much to Lemi’s dismay."
0,A stream wafting a sour odor ran through the middle of the widest street.
0,"The air near it was frigid, and Sammy eyed it with suspicion."
0,"“Be careful not to fall in,” Thanysa warned."
0,“There are a number of underground streams that feed into the city.
0,"We collect fresh water where they spring, but once it enters the city, we use it to wash away refuse."
0,The water is far more potent due to the overcrowding.
0,The ice ven normally suppresses the stench.”
0,“Ice ven?
0,This is ven enriched water like in Fiorrae?” Sammy asked.
0,"“Very perceptive, Lady Sammy."
0,"Fiorrae is to the south and southwest, and the underground streams originate there.”"
0,"Chloe looked around to all the craft-shops, woodworkers, and butchers."
0,“Is the orphanage really down here?” Sammy translated her question to Thanysa.
0,"“We originally held it between the outer and inner wall on the south side of the city, but the number of refugees grew too large."
0,We moved it to a warehouse to provide more room.
0,There are not as many orphaned children as you might think given the number of refugees.
0,It is over here.”
0,"That only meant children were killed just as much as adults, Sammy realized."
1,Thanysa turned from the stream down an alley just wide enough to transport crates.
0,A sheer rock face rose at the end with a simple rectangular entrance.
0,The whimpers and cries of children could be heard from the dark.
0,"She led them inside, and Sammy’s nose was immediately assaulted by a similar odor to that of the stream if not a little worse."
0,"Her eyes adjusted, and she saw that the warehouse was not as dark as she assumed."
0,"The back half of the large room was piled high with crates, barrels, and other wrapped and bound product."
0,Much of the hard stone floor in front of the storage was covered in coarse fabric to provide insulation to the two or three hundred children.
0,"None of them looked older than eight years old, if Sammy ignored the difference in stature between the races."
0,Those who were older were likely put to use elsewhere.
0,The first Forest Elf to notice Ceil called out to the other women.
0,"They immediately scrambled to tidy up soiled cloth, hush the crying children, and run the overflowing chamber pots out to the stream."
0,A fairy in the left corner quickly finished rinsing down three naked children with her water magic and wrapped them in a worn cloth.
0,She then ran to Ceil and bowed deeply.
0,"Being the only one to approach, she was likely the matron."
0,“My sincerest apologies for the current state of the orphanage.
0,"If we knew you were coming, we would have prepared.”"
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,"“No, this is what we wanted to see.”"
0,"There were only five women taking care of the numerous children, and each of them looked exhausted and prone to collapse, some struggling to even lift the smallest of the children."
0,“How long has it been since any of you have rested?”
0,"“One of us rests at a time, and we trade off, but that often means going two days without sleep before our turn comes around again.” "
0,“Why are you so short staffed?” 
0,“Lord Olvor does not feel the orphanage is important to the war effort.
0,The six of us had to plead to him to organize it initially.
0,"Before that, the children were neglected like all other refugees in the camp."
0,"Once the children started dying, we had to do something.”"
0,“I see…” 
0,"While Ceil and the matron conversed, Chloe located one of the children and ran to him."
0,He noticed her and a weak smile grew on his face.
0,It was the fairy boy they found outside the city.
0,She lifted the boy into her lap and talked with him and the other children around him.
0,None of them cared that they could not understand each other.
0,Their sorrowful expressions slowly changed as Chloe taught them the simple hand games she had learned from the children in Lemi’s village.
0,The scene warmed Sammy’s heart.
0,"Even though Chloe was human, none of the children cared, their innocence freeing them of any hatred or bias."
0,"They were starved for love and attention, and the moment Chloe offered it, they grasped for it with small, eager hands."
0,The Forest Elf watched in amazement as the first small cry of laughter was heard from a young fairy girl who could have been no older than three if she was human.
0,The women working in the orphanage were so busy taking care of the children that none had the time to play with them.
0,"“How many children are there,” Sammy asked."
0,"“As of this morning, 207.”"
0,Ceil’s eyes narrowed.
0,"“Thanysa, what is the largest estate in the inner city.”"
0,"“That would be Lord Olvar’s, your highness."
0,It has two manors and one servant house.”
0,“How many people are currently living there?” 
0,"“Lord Olvar, his two wives, and their five children.” "
0,“How many could live comfortably in both manors.” 
0,Thanysa grew a sly grin.
0,“Perhaps fifty if keeping to the standard of living the upper class are accustomed to.”
0,“And how many servants does he employ?” 
0,Now the matron’s eyes grew wide.
0,"“I am unsure,” Thanysa replied, “but the size of the servant house suggests that there may be at least twenty living there.”"
0,"Sammy couldn’t contain the excitement building in her chest, but she kept silent, not wanting to jump ahead of Ceil."
0,"“In the name of Empress Ceil of the Amelian Empire, I declare that Lord Olvar’s estate be repurposed into an orphanage and that his servants help care for the children."
0,"Should we win this war, the children will be the ones rebuilding the empire."
0,"There is nowhere safer in a siege than the central district, and should the children not be protected?"
0,"If Lord Olvar protests or wrongs the children in any manner, I order him to live in this warehouse."
0,How soon can you make the arrangements?”
0,“By tonight.” 
0,"Thanysa snapped her finger and a tiny fairy no taller than a foot, or maybe a few inches less, warped in out of nowhere."
0,"She recited Ceil’s decree to him verbatim, including her inflections, and then the tiny fairy vanished just as quickly as he appeared."
0,"“What was that?” Sammy asked, slightly dumbfounded."
0,"“A pixie,” Thanysa replied."
0,“They are a close relative to the fairies.
0,"A small number of them can use spatial magic as an extension of their body, but they can only use teleportation and only on themselves and whatever is directly on their person."
0,We employ them as messengers and spies.”
0,“How can I ever repay you?” 
0,The matron bowed herself before Ceil.
0,“You have done so much more than we ever could have hoped for.” 
0,The other orphanage workers who heard the decree knelt where they were and sung praises to their empress.
0,Ceil bent down and lifted the matron.
0,“All I ask is that you continue caring for these children and protect them when the siege begins.”
0,"“Of course. Of course, Your Highness.”"
0,"Content with what she saw, Ceil readied to leave the warehouse."
0,“Is it alright if I stay here?” Chloe asked with the small fairy boy in her arms and another fairy girl clinging to her skirt.
0,“All I wanted to see was the orphanage.
0,I don’t have anywhere else I want to go.”
0,“I see no issue.” 
0,Ceil granted Chloe one of the High Elf guards with Thanysa’s permission and left her at the orphanage.
1,"“Chloe is an odd one,” Ceil said as they walked back through the alleyway."
0,"“Says the one who went out of her way to oust the local Lord for those same children,” Sammy chuckled."
0,“Any idea of what you want to see next?”
0,“I would like to see how they are preparing to arm the citizens.
0,They have far too few soldiers to fight against Tolmyur’s army.”
0,"“I know the perfect location where they will not get annoyed by our presence,” Thanysa replied."
0,“Would anyone grow annoyed by their empress visiting them?” Sammy asked.
0,"“Not that they would openly express, but this smith is different."
0,He is my father.” 
0,“You were a smith?” 
0,"“Traditionally, Mountain Elf women are the warriors while the men are the workforce back in the village."
0,"Mountain Elf women can birth as many as four to twelve children at once, so we are restricted by law to one litter conception per family in order to control our rapid population growth."
0,"Extreme population and limited resources led to endless wars among Mountain Elves in the past, so the population control laws are rather strict.”"
0,"Sammy listened with confusion, not understanding how this answered her question."
0,“My mother only birthed my brother and I in her single allowed litter.
0,"Even though we no longer live in Syvad, my father refused to let me inherit his forge, since allowing me would be a breach of tradition."
0,He ordered me to enlist and is raising my brother to be his successor.
0,"My mother was employed in Amel to train the royal guard, so my father wanted me to follow her career."
0,"Now, I am the instructor of the briers here in Vallen, but only after my superior died in the Gallanvale.”"
0,"Chapter 13
“The Difficult Decision”
Sammy"
1,"Thanysa led Ceil and Sammy back the way they came down the stream road of the lowest tier, and Sammy had to immediately look away from a High Elf craftsman who pulled his blackened apron aside to relieve himself directly into the stream."
0,“You’d think they would care more when their empress is right in front of them…” Sammy sighed.
0,"“The workforce cares more for efficiency than appearance,” Thanysa explained."
0,"“The quicker he can get back to work, the more productive he will be."
0,"If you are bothered by nudity, then perhaps you should not enter the forge.”"
0,"“No, I am fine with it."
0,"Chloe would be a mess, though."
0,Lucky for her she decided to stay behind.” 
0,"The moment Sammy spoke those words, she thought of another individual."
0,She looked behind her and noticed Lemi trailing behind.
0,"Lemi’s expression was disconcerting, and she kept glancing up searching for any sign of the green on the tops of the buildings in the upper tiers."
0,"“Are you alright?” Sammy stopped walking, and so everyone else was forced to halt with her."
0,"Lemi did not answer, so Sammy put her arm around the girl."
0,She was shivering like a scared puppy.
0,Is the lack of greenery really that traumatizing for dryads?
0,Sammy hadn’t realized that Lemi was in such a state.
0,She hadn’t spoken or reacted to anything once they reached the bottom tier.
0,Sammy couldn’t even remember if Lemi had entered the warehouse orphanage.
0,“You can go back to the manor if you like.”
0,Lemi shook her head and drew closer to Sammy.
0,"“If I hold onto you, will you be okay?"
0,"If it becomes too unbearable, tell me, and we can go back.”"
0,Lemi nodded meekly.
1,Thanysa led them along the bottom tier to the south side of the city.
0,"Before Sammy could see the smiths and forges, she felt the heat."
0,"The temperature raised by no less than twenty degrees, and some of the craftsman wearing no more than their aprons sat next to the stream, which smelled slightly better now that it was closer to its fountain, to bask in its radiant chill."
0,“This way.” 
0,"Thanysa walked down another alleyway, and Sammy wondered if her family was a poorer smith in the city that could not afford a front-end shop."
0,"This idea conflicted with her perception of the family considering Thanysa was an instructor for Vallen’s special operations force and her mother was an instructor for the Amelian palace guard, both incredibly prominent careers or so she assumed."
0,"The alleyway opened to the widest, almost cavernous storefront carved deep into the tier above it."
0,The forge was completely open with thick stone pillars supporting the ceiling.
0,"Even standing outside of it, the temperature increased yet again, feeling like a sweltering summer day."
0,"The inside glowed with a deep orange, and the many men who worked within wore as little as was necessary to perform their labors, often no more than a small apron at their waist to cover their genitals from the sparks of the anvils and flames."
0,One of the largest individuals noticed the armed escort and walked out of the forge.
0,"He was a broad-shouldered beast of an elf with thick, mane-like hair running down his back dripping with sweat."
0,"His eyes were a darker orange, almost brown, and his ears were as long as Thanysa’s but hairless and pointed almost straight upwards."
0,"His exuberant muscles were toned and heat-roasted from the flames, almost dark enough to hide the freckles on his chest, shoulders, and arms."
0,"He approached Thanysa with a wide, fanged smile and embraced her, spinning her once in the air."
0,"“Thanysa, you never visit, but I assume you are on official business?” "
0,"He set her back on the ground, her leather armor now darkened with his sweat."
0,“Escorting…” He looked down at Ceil and immediately knelt.
0,"“Your Highness, it is a great honor to have you visit my humble forge.”"
0,"“You must be a smith of high renown to have the largest forge in the city,” Ceil said."
0,“You honor me.” 
0,"He bowed deeper, and his grin widened further to become almost haughty."
0,Either he was greatly proud of his standing or adored praise.
0,“Sarodyn is one of the few smiths in the Empire who can forge resfahil.
0,"Such skill would warrant no less,” Thanysa explained."
0,Ceil’s eyes widened.
0,“Resfahil weaponry could give us an immense advantage in this battle.”
0,"“Alas, Your Highness, the ore to smelt the alloy is in terribly short supply."
0,All we possess has been claimed by a single order requested by the Thorn General.” 
0,Sarodyn stood and rested his hands on his hip.
0,“What brings the young empress to my forge?
0,Here to make a request of your own?”
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“I wish to see how you are arming the civilians for the siege to make up for the lack of soldiers.”
0,Sarodyn nodded and promptly walked off.
0,"“This way,” he called with a wave of his massive hand."
1,He led them to the far-left side of the forge-front where many large wooden crates sat in a row along the wall.
0,"“While every fairy and elf in the city can use magic, most average citizens only learn what helps them in daily life, not combat."
0,"We cannot expect them to learn offensive magic quickly, let alone safely, so instead we provide these.” "
0,"He dipped his hand in and raised it slowly, letting countless finger-sized pieces of metal sift through."
0,"To Sammy, they almost looked like large silver bullets, but they were sharpened to a point."
0,“What are those?” Sammy asked.
0,"“Spearheads, young lass."
0,Spears and pikes are the most versatile weapon for almost any form of mass warfare if you have room to wield it.
0,"They can be used with minimal training, and the reach keeps you safe so long as your opponent lacks magic or a longer spear,” Sarodyn guffawed."
0,"“Humans lack in magic compared to elfkind, no offense to you, which makes these weapons ever more vital."
0,"If we can hold out against their magic until their ven depletes, we will have the advantage.”"
0,Sarodyn reached behind the crate and lifted three different spears in a single grip.
0,He handed a short spear about two meters long to Ceil and the mid length spear about four meters long to Justin who struggled to hold it steady.
0,"Sarodyn looked at him depressingly, and then took it from him to hand to Thanysa."
0,"He held the longest and thinnest of the spears, an astonishing 8 meters."
0,They were each tipped with the same small spearhead.
0,“The spears are for the citizens who will not be defending the walls in the case of a breach.
0,The pikes are for our soldiers.
0,"And this,” Sarodyn raised the spear by the base of the haft, almost making it reach halfway up to the next tier of the city, “is for the airborne fairies."
0,"These spears are too flimsy for regular combat, but in the hands of a flyer, they can be quite lethal."
0,Word has it that we killed the Tolmyur captain in charge of the Vallen campaign with one.
0,"Flyers are few among fairies, so we need to protect them."
0,Better to have their spear break after one or two uses and replace it than force them to approach their enemy and get killed.”
0,"“Why not use bows,” Sammy asked."
0,Sarodyn walked over to another crate and dug out a handful of even smaller tips than the spearheads.
0,"Like the spearheads, they were all perfectly identical."
0,Military mass production was on full display.
0,“I showed you the spearheads first because you asked how we armed the citizens.
0,"Bows require far more skill, so we cannot let just anyone draw the string, especially in the city."
0,"We have no shortage of wood, but we lack in iron, so we cannot make too much expendable ammunition.”"
0,"“Every soldier is given a shortbow and a small quiver of arrows,” Thanysa explained."
0,“Standard equipment.
0,This goes for winged fairies as well.
0,The carpenters are currently fletching a large number of wood-tipped arrows that will be kept in barrels along the wall walk.”
0,"“In your opinion, what are our chances of surviving the siege?” Ceil asked."
0,"“Oh, you ask difficult questions, Your Highness.” "
0,Sarodyn retrieved the spears and returned them to their piles behind the crates.
0,"“If I am to be completely honest, I would say we have a two in three chance of surviving so long as they do not choose the prolonged route and starve us."
0,"With how many refugees we have taken in, once our supply of food is cut, we will not last."
0,"In the worst case, we could turn some of the refugees into food provisions."
0,"Mountain Elves have a history of eating their own, but I doubt the other races would be so willing even in the worst of situations.”"
0,Sammy shuddered at the gruesome prospect.
0,She would rather starve.
0,“I see.
0,"Thank you,” Ceil said."
0,“Do you wish to see anything else?
0,I could show you around the forge.”
0,Ceil looked into the glowing orange building and then over to Lemi who was already wilting from stress.
0,“That will not be necessary.
0,I am grateful we have such skilled craftsman here in Revlan.
0,Keep up the hard work.”
0,"“Of course, Your Highness.” "
0,"Sarodyn bowed again, but he did appear slightly depressed that Ceil declined his invitation to show off his forge."
0,"“Then we shall take our leave,” Thanysa announced, nodding to her father."
0,"“I hope you would spare some time to visit when not on official business,” Sarodyn said as Thanysa led them down the alley."
1,“Do you not get along with your father?” Sammy asked.
0,"“I harbor no ill will, but…” Thanysa shook her head."
0,“I was always fascinated by my father’s work.
0,My brother is incompetent and has been unable to grasp even the most basic concepts of resfahil alloys.
0,"Resfahil resists and disperses magic, so smelting, forging, and smithing the metal requires precise control of a natural flame, unlike all other metals that can be forged with the assistance of magic."
0,"While I cannot vouch for my own skill having never apprenticed the trade, I feel I could have done better if my father only gave me the opportunity."
0,But there is nothing to be gained in dwelling on what could have been.
0,"I take pride in my current position, and I am sure that pleases my father."
0,Where would you like to go next?”
0,Ceil looked back again at Lemi.
0,“I think we have spent long enough down here.
0,"After what Sarodyn said, I wanted to ask about your food stores, but if they are also on the bottom tier, I will pass.”"
0,"“The majority of the warehouses are similar to what you saw at the orphanage, but there is somewhere I can take you that should help the young dryad feel better and hopefully answer your question.” "
1,Thanysa brought them up to the first tier on the east side of the city and then to the wall walk of the inner wall.
0,Almost immediately Lemi had a full resurrection from the anxiety of the bottom tier after viewing the lush greenery of the city from high upon the wall and the expansive fields on the outer side.
0,Lemi released Sammy’s arm and pushed her to Justin who was struggling to walk after having climbed all those steps.
0,"Justin refused to stop and rest, citing that he needed to push himself or he would not recover, so Sammy hung his arm over her shoulder and carried him forward with an exasperated grin."
0,Chloe could not handle heights or anywhere with male nudity.
0,Lemi could not handle locations without vegetation.
0,"Justin could not endure anywhere that required even the lightest athleticism to access, at least for now."
0,"Her friends had a strange set of weaknesses, all of which they had encountered on their tour of the city."
1,"When they reached the west side of the city, Thanysa stopped so they could view the ongoing harvest."
0,"Sammy watched the tiny workers, mostly older children, in amazement."
0,“Crops even grow during the winter here?”
0,"“Winters in the Amelian Empire are often mild, so we can have multiple yields before summer arrives, but the yields are smaller, and the vegetables are not as healthy,” Ceil explained."
0,“Crops grown during winter are often kept for village stores whereas the summer crops are exported for profit.
0,"Oh, this excludes seasonal crops that cannot be stored for long periods of time without spoiling."
0,"Only preservables like grains, lentils, and root vegetables are handled this way, but those make up the bulk of most crops."
0,Fresh fruits are often only a seasonal luxury unless you are of high status.”
0,Ceil’s rigid expression melted when she talked about agriculture and pointed out the crops growing in each of the fields beyond the wall.
0,Seeing this warmed Sammy’s heart.
0,"Ceil would almost smile at times during her explanations, but her lips never managed to curl upwards as if her cheeks had long lost the ability to do so."
0,"“You are mostly growing barley from the appearance, but the ears do not look ripe.”"
0,"“We wanted to hold off on the harvest as long as possible, but with only one town and a village remaining, both mostly evacuated already, we cannot wait any longer."
0,"We began the harvest two days ago, and the yield is far lower than what we were hoping."
0,"We could speed the aging of some of the crop with life magic, but all our life mages are held up treating the refugees.”"
0,"“The Melians that arrived with Justin, if they are willing, we can send those not treating Justin to the fields to help increase the yield,” Ceil suggested and then paused to think."
0,"“If Tolmyur plans to starve us, perhaps we could use the Melians to help grow crops within the city."
0,I do not know how large a field the Melians could tend with their ven capacity.
0,"If they are willing, speak with them and allocate the appropriate size of garden space from the central district estates to be used for crops."
0,"Dryads replenish their ven quickly, so even if it is not enough to sustain the city, we can at least continue growing during the siege until the soil loses its nutrients.”"
0,"Thanysa snapped her fingers, and again the pixie appeared from nowhere."
0,"She recited Ceil’s suggestion to him, mentioning that it was not an order and that the dryads could refuse."
0,The messenger bowed to Ceil in the air and then vanished.
0,Ceil looked over the fields and then back into the city to see the numerous people moving about.
0,"“Including this yield, do you have an estimate on how many days we can last with the city’s current population?”"
0,"“I apologize, Your Highness."
0,Such estimates are outside my expertise.”
0,“Your best guess then.” 
0,“Fifty days?
0,"If Tolmyur does choose to starve us, they will also need to consume their own food stores, and hopefully it is lower than ours."
0,"Feeding an army requires more sustenance than feeding civilians, and unless they have an abundant food source, that may not be an option for them.”"
0,"“Are you employing other methods of gathering food, such as hunting or foraging?” Sammy asked."
0,"“Of course, but we have already cleaned out the nearby forests."
0,"And, your Habha has been very helpful in that regard.”"
0,"“I hope that wasn’t sarcasm,” Sammy groaned."
0,"Coby flew off the day after Justin showed up, only showing himself periodically to check up on Sammy and sleep, and each time he looked exhausted."
0,"“No, Lady Sammy."
0,I speak in all seriousness.
0,Habha are one of the fastest on wings.
0,He has been hunting far from the city and delivering his prey directly to the butchers in exchange for the fatty scraps that do not preserve well.”
0,“Coby’s been doing that?!”
0, Sammy could not believe what she heard.
0,Even Ceil was amazed.
0,She had to wonder if Coby was intelligent enough on his own to realize that the city needed more food or if he was just bartering premium fatty cuts for his kills.
0,“I would not doubt that he has doubled our meat stores in the few days he has been here.
0,Perhaps in the future we should train Habha.”
0,"“I don’t know if that is possible,” Sammy grimaced."
0,“Coby is just an odd one.”
0,"“I agree,” Ceil added."
0,“They are highly aggressive and territorial.
0,Coby is only with us because of Sammy’s absurdity.”
0,"“Saving him may have been crazy, but he has helped us in turn many times,” Sammy retorted."
1,The tour finished with a visit to the soldier camp outside the northeast wall of the city where Ceil observed the training of the combat-able citizens and refugees.
0,"Justin could barely walk by this point even with Lemi numbing the ache of his muscles and boosting his stamina, so they decided to retrieve Chloe and return to the manor."
1,"On the way back up the tiers, Chloe was pensively silent despite the light conversation in English between Sammy, Justin, and Ceil, ignoring the angry shouts of the crowd."
0,"Disregarding what was being discussed, Chloe spoke up just before they passed through the curtain wall gate."
0,“I’m staying for the siege.”
0,Everyone stopped and turned to look at Chloe.
0,"“You and Justin can decide to leave if you want, but I’m staying.”"
0,Ceil did not look please with Chloe’s decision.
0,“What led you to make that choice?”
0,“I already said I would fight for you.
0,"But… more than that, I don’t want to abandon those children."
0,"My fire magic is strong, and if the city falls, I couldn’t bear the idea that it might not have happened if I stayed.”"
0,“And nothing I can say will make you change your mind?” 
0,Chloe shook her head.
0,Ceil reached over and embraced Chloe.
0,"She spoke something in a whisper that Sammy could barely hear, “Thank you… and sorry.”"
1,"Back inside the inner city, several guards stood on the street outside Dharin’s estate."
0,A lavishly robed fairy was in a heated argument with Dharin and Kiri.
0,"When the fairy saw Ceil approach, he sent his guards to surround her."
0,The four High Elves brandished their spears and glared down at the far smaller fairies.
0,"“Lord Olvor, what is the problem,” Ceil asked."
0,“This is what happens when a peasant is sat on a throne.
0,The briers removed me from my estate because of your decree.
0,"First you falsely accuse the Rose General of treason after all he has done to save fairy lives, and now you remove me from my position as Lord after all I have done to prepare this city for the siege.”"
0,Ceil’s eyebrows narrowed.
0,“I did no such thing.
0,You can keep your position as Lord.
0,"If you were removed from your estate, then you must have openly opposed offering your spare rooms to children in need.”"
0,“We already offered my city to those children when we gain nothing from doing so.
0,We could have turned them away.”
0,"“Had you done so and I learned of it, I would have revoked your status as Lord."
0,"I am grateful you are accepting refugees, and I am proud of what I have seen in your city in preparation for the battle."
0,I did not target you specifically.
0,I asked who in the inner city had the largest estate and then next confirmed that there were plentiful vacancies to house the children and servants to care for them.
0,"If your estate lacked in any of these areas, I would not have made the decree and would have chosen another."
0,You are free to return to your estate if you are willing to accept those children.”
0,Ceil walked forward while Thanysa and the four guards shielded her.
0,Olvor’s guards parted nervously.
0,“Your empire is no more.
0,"This is the Vallen Kingdom, and I refuse to acknowledge your authority,” Olvor said as Ceil passed."
0,“So be it.
0,"Until Eydis FeAmel reclaims it, the Amel Dynasty has ended."
0,"I, as the new empress, claim all territories of the former empire."
0,You can accept my rule or live in that dark warehouse alone.”
0,"Ceil turned onto Dharin’s small estate and walked briskly for the manor without another word, her pace increasing to a run as she neared it."
0,She then flung open the door and slammed it behind her.
0,Thanysa and the guards stood before the property to block Lord Olvor and his guards.
0,"Sammy wanted to chase after Ceil, but she was still supporting Justin."
0,Chloe and Lemi hurried to the manor in her stead.
0,"“The rise of the Cielian Empire, the Empire of Life,” Dharin mused."
0,He turned to Lord Olvor and donned the authoritative presence of the Thorn General.
0,"“The armies of Vallen are in full support of Her Highness, Empress Ceil.”"
0,"“The people of Vallen also pledge their loyalty to Her Highness, Empress Ceil,” Kiri followed."
0,"“Lord Olvor, out of respect for your position as Lord of Revlan and the neighboring towns and villages, I ask that you submit yourself to Empress Ceil."
0,"Should you refuse, by my authority as head of the royal council, I will revoke your title of lord and find another to replace you."
0,I am sure there will be many who are willing.”
0,"Lord Olvor’s face grew red with anger, but when he saw the iron expressions of Dharin and Kiri, his countenance fell in defeat."
0,"Even if he wanted to claim Vallen independent, either Dharin or Kiri would be crowned monarch, and they both expressed support for Ceil."
0,"“Take me back to my estate,” he ordered his guards, walking off with his slender tail literally tucked between his legs."
1,Chloe spent the evening with Ceil to help her through the anxiety caused by her declaration and to thank her for what she did for the orphans.
0,"Sammy was helping as well, but there was an important discussion she needed to have with Justin."
0,She helped Justin to their room and found Coby asleep by the window with his two jagged yellow plumes jutting forward once again like bizarre moth antennae.
0,"“I still can’t get use to that,” Justin said while Sammy helped him sit down on their bed mats."
0,"After the exhausting tour all over the city, Justin could not stand without his legs shaking uncontrollably and buckling."
0,“We pushed you too hard.
0,"Tyree said today was more damaging than helpful, but it’s times like this that make me glad we have life magic freely available."
0,It’ll only set your rehabilitation back a few days.
0,It’d be quicker if gravity wasn’t so strong here.”
0,Sammy sat behind Justin and rested her head on the back of his shoulder.
0,She wrapped her arms around him and felt his ribs in her embrace.
0,"With a deep breath, she spoke the words she had been holding in for the past few days."
0,“You are far too weak to take part in the siege.
0,I want you to leave the city as soon as you can walk on your own.
0,"If that takes too long, I will beg the Melians to take you.”"
0,"Justin grabbed Sammy’s wrist, pulled it off his chest, and then intertwined their fingers."
0,“What about you?”
0,Sammy was glad that Justin did not outright reject her request.
0,Even he should realize how much of a liability he would be when the fighting begins.
0,"But, when he directed the question back at her, her willfully suppressed emotions broke through, and she gripped his hand tighter."
0,“I’m scared.
0,I keep having nightmares about Gullivan.
0,What I saw in Nalain keeps flashing in my mind when I think about the siege.
0,It makes the nightmares worse.
0,"Chloe is trying to help me with them, and Ceil says that I will get over them, but I’m not strong like they are.”"
0,“You are plenty strong.
0,Someone weak would have never been able to carry me all over the world and take care of me long enough to find help.
0,I am alive because of you.”
0,"“If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have gotten hurt."
0,You would have received help sooner.”
0,Justin turned to face Sammy.
0,“This is unlike you.
0,What happened to the headstrong girl that never gave a damn what others thought and would power through any trial with sheer willpower and no shortage of stubbornness?”
0,“You happened.” 
0,Sammy clung to Justin’s robe with a fallen gaze.
0,“Eydis happened.
0,The war happened.
0,I didn’t know if you would survive.
0,I don’t know if Eydis is alive.
0,"If it was just me, I would be fine, but I have things I care about more than myself."
0,I want Ceil to run.
0,I want Chloe to run.
0,Lemi too.
0,"I act stubborn in front of Ceil, but I’m scared."
0,"Because Ceil decided to stay, I want to stay, especially now that Chloe is staying."
0,I don’t want to leave them.
0,"I want to fight too, but I can’t."
0,"I don’t know how, and I will be in their way."
0,I’m just as useless as you are.”
0,"“That’s harsh,” Justin quipped."
0,“I’m being serious here!” 
0,"Sammy glared angrily at Justin, but he only looked back with a soft, understanding smile."
0,“Sounds to me like you already made your decision.”
0,“I have… I have but…” 
0,“Then stay and don’t question it.
0,That’s what you would normally do.
0,"No one will say you are useless, and it’s not like being in the city will make Ceil any less of a leader or Chloe any less powerful."
0,"If anything, you being here will give them reason to fight harder."
0,They care for you as much as you care for them.
0,"If they didn’t, they wouldn’t have wanted you to run."
0,"So, are you going to stay?”"
0,"“If I can’t convince them to run, then yah, I want to stay.”"
0,“Good.
0,"Then I am staying too.”
"
0,“What?
0,No!
0,Justin!
0,Haven’t you been listening to anything I said?”
0,"“I’ve said this before, but I kind of feel responsible for everything that’s happened."
0,"I know I didn’t have much control over it, but it all started when I took Eydis in."
0,"I haven’t told you this, but after you met Eydis and took us to the mall, when you learned the truth, that evening Eydis and I talked."
0,You made a good impression on her.
0,"She liked you, but she told me to ask you to stay away, for your safety."
0,"She practically begged me to, but I refused."
0,"I told Eydis to try and become good friends with you because I thought that having another girl she could talk with would help her, although I did not tell her my reasoning."
0,"“Because of me, you ended up getting involved just as much as I did."
0,"I don’t regret it, but I would still feel terrible if something happened to you because of all this."
0,I’m not going to run.
0,I’ll help where I can.
0,I am probably useless in a fight.
0,You said it yourself.
0,"But even so, I can at least make a good meat shield.”"
0,“That’s not funny!” 
0,"Sammy pushed Justin in the shoulder, and he almost fell to his back, catching himself with his arm."
0,“God… Think about other’s feelings before you speak.” 
0,"Tears dripped from Sammy’s chin onto the bed mat, and she clutched her fists in her lap."
0,"She wanted to punch him for that comment, but she felt she had caused him enough pain already, not only from prolonging his suffering by telling the Arkhon she would find him help, but also from all the times she abused him both physically and emotionally after she broke up with him."
0,And yet he never stopped caring for her.
0,“Sorry.
0,"Bad joke,” Justin apologized."
0,Sammy grabbed Justin and pulled him down onto the mat so that she could hold him and cry silently into his chest.
0,“Promise me… promise me you will survive the battle.”
0,“I will.” 
0,He rested one hand behind Sammy’s head and held her close.
0,"“I am good a dodging, remember?”"
0,"A sound rose from Sammy’s throat that she did not know whether it was a hiccup, a laugh, or a cry."
0,She clung tighter to the warmth of Justin’s chest.
0,“Smart ass…”
0,"Chapter 14
“A School of Combat”
Sammy"
1,"“So, you decided to stay.” "
0,Ceil nervously rolled the torn piece of bread into a ball with her fingers.
0,"Sammy did not receive the same gratitude and apology that Ceil had given Chloe, so Sammy had to assure herself that this was because Ceil truly wanted her to flee for her safety, not because Ceil thought she would be unable to contribute to the battle."
0,“Neither of us wanted to abandon you and Chloe.
0,"We won’t be much use fighting up front like maybe Chloe would, but we’ll help where we can,” Sammy tried to explain."
0,"“It was never about whether or not you could help,” Ceil said, much to Sammy’s relief."
0,“I am worried about your ability to protect yourself.
0,A lot can happen in a war.
0,There is no telling what you might encounter.”
0,"“There is little time until the siege, but perhaps I can help,” Dharin spoke up."
0,"“Thanysa is an instructor for the briers, and that includes the use of martial weaponry and hand-to-hand combat."
0,Learning the basics with a sword or spear could save your life.”
0,"“Eydis taught us the basics of her family’s martial arts, but only the parts useful for self-defense,” Sammy explained."
0,“Did she truly?
0,There is little difference in skills used for defense and those use for offense.
0,"If you know the basics, Thanysa may be able to help you more than I originally thought."
0,I will arrange a location for her to instruct you somewhere here in the central district so that Sir Justin will not need to travel far.”
0,“Will Justin even be able to participate?” Ceil asked.
0,“He couldn’t even hold a spear yesterday.”
0,“That was a pike.
0,You had the spear.
0,"Maybe if it was something smaller, he would be fine.” "
0,Sammy fought desperately for Justin’s inclusion.
0,"Because the self-defense class back in Gullivan was only for women, he was unable to actively participate aside from demonstrations, and although he had some knowledge about what Eydis taught, he never practiced."
0,His inability to use any offensive magic also worried her.
0,“Justin needs a way to protect himself.”
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“Sorry.
0,I did not mean to say that I was against him participating.”
0,“Then I will make the arrangements.” 
0,“Thank you.” 
0,Sammy bowed to Dharin over the table.
1,The morning proceeded like the previous day except it was Thanysa who came to the door instead of Dharin.
0,Everyone was present except for Chloe.
0,"“Do you know where she went,” Sammy asked Ceil."
0,“She is helping set up the orphanage at Lord Olvor’s estate.
0,I doubt she requires combat training anyway.”
0,"“She was one of the better students in Eydis’s class,” Sammy sighed, realizing once more just how absurd her friend was."
0,"Then again, she almost died in Melia, so Sammy wanted her to participate anyway."
0,“It’s not like these lessons will go all day.
0,We should make her participate.
0,She can spend time at the orphanage after.”
0,"As they passed Dharin’s gardens, now looking far lusher and more vibrant than when they first arrived, Sammy noticed something missing, the Melians."
0,Only Tyree and Tae remained.
0,"“They left early this morning from what I hear,” Thanysa explained."
0,“They are helping with the harvest while space is being allocated here in the inner city for their crops.
0,They were quite ecstatic to be of use instead of acting as living ornaments of the Thorn General’s gardens.”
0,Sammy was amazed how quickly Ceil’s suggestions were being put into practice.
0,The people trusted Ceil as their empress.
0,"Lord Olvor opposed at first, but none of the other nobles had come to protest the use of their lands."
0,"Sammy felt that each of Ceil’s suggestions was brilliant, and anyone would be a fool to reject them."
0,"If the empire comes out victorious in the war, Sammy knew Ceil would make a wonderful ruler."
1,"Thanysa led them to the eastern sector of the central district to a large stone building almost as overgrown as Dharin’s except the vegetation on top was perfectly placed for aesthetics, and the entrance and garden was beautifully cultured."
0,Stone benches lined ponds decorated with skillfully crafted statues of nude fairies and elves.
0,Winter flowers of white and red bloomed all around.
0,Lemi ran through the gardens spinning and dancing with such abandon that some of her white petals fell loose from her hair.
0,Sammy smiled.
0,Lemi had to be happy that they went to a location that was lush and vibrant instead of the cold hard stone of the lower tiers.
0,"“What is this building,” Sammy inquired."
0,“A dance hall for formal engagements.
0,"It is large enough to hold combat practice, and the noble who owns it readily gave me permission to use it after I informed her it was for Her Highness.”"
0,"“The noble only wants to curry favor with me,” Ceil retorted."
0,Sammy nudged Ceil with her shoulder.
0,“Don’t be so pessimistic.”
1,"As opposed to the beautifully artistic garden, the inside was more grandiose."
0,The original stone structure had been carved over by intricate patterns with accents overlaid by possibly silver.
0,"Unlike the wood-shuttered windows of the manors, foggy glass panes were set into tall pointed arch windows with delicate green curtains pulled to the side."
0,"Large, polished stone pots between each window held tall plants that reminded Sammy of bamboo but with long, runcinate leaves."
0,Lemi circled one of the large pots to admire the plant she had never seen before.
0,"“Is it really okay to fight in here,” Sammy asked, worried about being unable to pay for any damages."
0,"“Unless you have incredibly powerful magic, there should be no problem."
0,"The owner knew full well our plans for her hall,” Thanysa said."
0,"“There should be no problems in Chloe’s absence,” Ceil added."
0,"“I think Chloe would be too afraid to use her magic even if she was here,” Sammy retorted."
0,"Thanysa walked over to the small, elevated, oval stage at the front where a few bags were placed."
0,"She removed simple leather training armor and passed it out to Sammy, Ceil, Lemi, and Justin."
0,One by one she helped them don the armor.
0,Trousers were also provided to replace everyone’s skirts so that they could don the leg armor.
0,Ceil made Sammy force Justin to look away while she changed despite Sammy’s assurance that Justin would not look.
0,"Lemi appeared uncomfortable in the armor, which was understandable considering she usually only wore her dava."
0,Ceil likewise was uncomfortable but for another reason.
0,“I hate trousers.
0,"My tails are so long I must run them down the pant legs, so they keep rubbing.” Ceil cringed with every bowlegged step."
0,“The trousers are unisex.
0,"If you are that sensitive, you can use the tail hole in the back,” Thanysa said."
0,Ceil fingered the tail hole as if seriously considering its use but then looked over at Justin.
0,“I decline.
0,I will endure it.”
0,"Thanysa removed a number of weapons including two types of swords, staves, spears, and a long, thin shield."
0,"“Your Highness, having lived in the palace, I assume you were trained in combat?”"
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,"“They cared more about purging my commoner upbringing and teaching bed manners over any form of combat, but I was taught a little.”"
0,“Any arts you are practiced in?” 
0,"“Staves, unarmed, and rapiers.” "
0,Thanysa tossed a pair of gloves to Ceil.
0,“Show me.” 
0,"She took a peculiar, unarmed stance with one fist raised."
0,Sammy immediately recognized it from Eydis’s lessons.
0,"Ceil matched the stance, and without a signal, the duel began."
0,"Thanysa refrained from attacking at first, letting Ceil show the maneuvers ingrained in her, but Sammy could tell they were sloppy at best, like Ceil knew the form and what they should look like but had never put in the required practice time to perfect them."
0,"Slowly, Thanysa added in strikes until Ceil was eventually overwhelmed."
0,And then it ended as abruptly as it began.
0,"“Less than even a single season’s worth of practice,” Thanysa critiqued."
0,"“As I said,” Ceil replied."
0,They changed to staves where Ceil showed far more proficiency.
0,"Thanysa moved to offense rather quickly after only three strikes from Ceil, but like the first match, Ceil was eventually overpowered and was on her back after only a few minutes."
0,"“They do not teach staves at the palace, at least not to the royal family."
0,This is self-taught.”
0,"“Out of necessity in Fiorrae,” Ciel said."
0,"“Your time there was short, but necessity breeds competence."
0,Your skill with the staff is far better.”
0,"Rapiers followed, and Ceil’s performance was worse than unarmed."
0,"In a real fight, Ceil would have died in the first few seconds."
0,"Thanysa asked about magic, but Ceil could only use life magic, limiting her combat options."
0,"In the end, Thanysa determined that improving Ceil’s competence with staves would best serve her abilities, especially when she could use her staff as a conduit for life magic."
0,Ceil was heavily flushed in the face after the assessment and sat down adjusting her tails inside her pant legs.
1,"Lemi followed Ceil, but she could only use a bow."
0,"According to her, Melians were not trained for war like the Kedros, Pefkos, or Elatos, the three warrior tribes of Dhuillir."
0,"They only practiced archery by imperial mandate in preparation should they be called to battle, but even then, few actually practiced."
0,Melians were far more laid back than their other dryad counterparts.
0,"Most other tribes had means of combat unique to them, but the Melians did not."
0,"“You are really powerful with the bow, though,” Sammy said, expressing confidence in Lemi’s ability."
0,"“You took off that cedar dryad’s arm with an arrow, and you blew up that one soldier’s chest."
0,I don’t think anyone else can do that with just an arrow.”
0,"“It’s not the arrow,” Lemi replied."
0,“It’s life magic.
0,"I put magic on the arrow, and it works when the arrow hits something living.”"
0,"“That is brilliant,” Ceil said with wide eyes."
0,“Do all Melians do this?”
0,Lemi nodded.
0,"“Most of them, if they are good at life magic.”"
0,“Can you give me a demonstration?” Thanysa requested.
0,"Lemi nodded excitedly and placed her hand on one of the bamboo-like plants, ignoring the bow Thanysa removed from the bag for her."
0,The plant grew a new branch that curved into the recognizable shape of a bow and then sprouted a long root-like fiber from the top.
0,"Lemi snapped the branch off at the base, and after bracing the base of the bow with her foot, she bent it to attach the root to the other tip."
0,"After a practice draw, Lemi’s eyes widened."
0,“This is good wood!”
0,"“The wood is thin and hollow, so we cannot use it for bows,” Thanysa said."
0,"“If you grow it as a bow, it is really good!” "
0,Lemi grew an arrow from the same stalk and snapped it off.
0,"She knocked it into the string and drew the bow, releasing the arrow at one of the plants across the large hall without taking any time to aim."
0,"Once the arrow struck the stalk, it ruptured with a loud crack, sending the tall plant careening onto the floor."
0,“Lemi!
0,Don’t destroy the place!”
0,Lemi looked back at Sammy confused.
0,“But she wanted a demonstration.” 
0,She quickly ran over to the plant and hoisted it back onto the pot with some effort.
0,"Ignoring Thanysa’s assurance that it was not a problem, Lemi used life magic to fuse the plant back to the base growing from the pot."
0,All that remained of Lemi’s damage was a small knot in the stalk and that the plant was shorter by about a foot.
1,"Thanysa was confident in Lemi’s ability, so she turned to Sammy for the next assessment."
0,"“Eydis taught me the same hand-to-hand that Ceil used, but I am worse than Ceil, and I only know self-defense.”"
0,Thanysa tossed the pair of gloves to Sammy and took her fighting stance.
0,"Sammy knew she expected an engagement, but she was embarrassed."
0,There was no way she could show anything of worth.
0,"As if reading Sammy’s thoughts, Thanysa spoke up."
0,“Do not worry about your skill.
0,"If I do not know what level you are at, I will not know what to teach.”"
0,Sammy breathed deep and raised one fist with her other arm bent at her side.
0,"She expected Thanysa to hold back and defend as she had with Ceil, but this time Thanysa started on offense."
0,Eydis’s instructions returned to Sammy one by one as she dodged and feinted for several minutes.
0,"Sammy saw an opening, and with a swift strike to Thanysa’s side, Thanysa fell to one knee."
0,"In this position, there was a takedown Sammy learned shortly before Eydis’s disappearance."
0,She grabbed Thanysa’s wrist and swept her foot at her anchor leg.
0,"With a quick twist of Thanysa’s arm, Sammy was on her back looking up at the ceiling."
0,She had no idea what happened.
0,"“You did well to find the opening I gave you, but the takedown just now was sloppy."
0,At least I knew what you were trying to do.
0,"I know precisely where the First Princess left off on your training, and it appears she did skip most the offensive skills, or you would have caught the earlier openings and how to utilize them."
0,She followed the same training regimen my mother taught the palace guards.
0,Perhaps my mother was the First Princess’s instructor as well.”
0,Thanysa extended her hand to Sammy.
0,“Can you use any weaponry?”
0,Sammy shook her head.
0,“Combat magic?”
0,Again Sammy shook her head but then stopped.
0,"“I do have one thing I can do, but it’s not really an attack.”"
0,“Show me.” 
0,Thanysa removed a small bluish-silver ring from her pocket and slipped it over her glove.
0,She then stood a few yards away from Sammy.
0,“You want me to attack you?”
0,“This ring is resfahil.
0,It will dispel whatever you attack me with.”
0,Sammy took a deep breath.
0,"When she attacked Ceil out of anger, it only cracked her lip, so she doubted that it would hurt Thanysa."
0,"A ball of water formed in Sammy’s hand, and she threw it at Thanysa."
0,The ball vaporized into mist when it impacted her glove instead of bursting.
0,Thanysa’s eyes narrowed.
0,She removed the ring and grabbed her staff.
0,“Again.”
0,Sammy created another ball of water and threw it.
0,"Thanysa moved the top of the staff into the ball’s path, and the moment it burst against the staff, the staff swung back and nearly hit Thanysa in the face."
0,"It was far more forceful than Thanysa expected, wrenching her wrist, but when she inspected the staff, there was no damage."
0,“I see.”
0,She returned the staff and folded her arms.
0,"“I am not a magic instructor, especially not for the water element, so I cannot help you turn that non-lethal attack into something lethal."
0,"As it is, it is well suited for defense."
0,"For weapons, I will focus on teaching you the spear."
0,"As my father explained it, spears can be used with minimal training and are safer with their longer reach."
0,I can also fill in the holes in your hand-to-hand instruction.”
1,Thanysa looked over at Justin who would be next for assessment.
0,"Not only was there a language barrier, but he also still looked far too weak to even perform an assessment."
0,Her disparaging expression was disconcerting.
0,What could Justin do when he wasn’t even able to walk up steps or hold a slightly longer spear?
0,"“It’s going to be the usual again, isn’t it,” Justin sighed with a self-depreciating grin."
0,Sammy felt terrible.
0,"Justin always had to sit out of Eydis’s instructions, both with normal magic lessons and once she began the combat magic classes, left to meditate with the hope that he would somehow recognize and control his ven."
0,Sammy’s heart raced as she thought of something to say.
0,"“Justin can use time magic,” she announced in a hurry."
0,"Ceil shook her head exasperated, and Thanysa looked wide eyed at the atrophied man."
0,“Is this true?” Thanysa asked.
0,"“Yes, but he can’t do anything but--” Sammy almost recited her usual belittling remark on Justin’s ability, and it cut at her heart with every word she spoke."
0,"Old habits…, Sammy thought to herself."
0,"Even after everything Justin had done and the love and care he had shown her, she still defaulted to insulting him as if nothing had changed from the weeks after she broke up with him."
0,A sinking feeling hung on her heart and threatened to choke out tears of self-reproach.
0,Justin was not useless.
0,Far from it.
0,“Justin saved my life multiple times using it.
0,His reaction time is incredible.
0,He probably can’t hold a weapon well enough to use it for now.
0,Maybe by the time the battle starts he could.
0,But…” 
0,“May I ask what he can do with his magic?” 
0,Sammy stood next to Justin.
0,“Do you have anything you can throw?”
0,Thanysa walked over to the bag and removed what looked like a few bean bags.
0,“Throw one of them as hard as you can at me.
0,Lemi can heal me if it hits.”
0,“Shouldn’t you tell Sir Justin?” 
0,“No need.
0,Watch.”
0,Thanysa stood only about four yards away.
0,"At this distance, Sammy knew that avoiding the small bean bag would be impossible for her."
0,"Sammy trusted in Justin to protect her, and she knew that no one but Justin would be able to do it."
0,"Without warning, Thanysa threw the bag with all her strength."
0,Sammy didn’t even have time to think before something appeared in front of her face.
0,"She winced back, and then Justin stumbled into her."
0,She barely managed to catch him before he fell.
0,In his hand was the bean bag that nearly hit her face.
0,“I thought you were up to something when you stood next to me.” 
0,Justin stabled himself on his knees and then stood with Sammy’s aid.
0,“A little warning would have been nice.”
0,“That would have ruined the demonstration.” 
0,Sammy held Justin close at her side and smiled at Thanysa with confidence.
0,Thanysa’s mouth hung partially agape.
0,"“I felt his magic, but there was no channeling time."
0,Is that even possible?” 
0,"“He’s awesome, right?!” "
0,"In direct contrast to the guilt Sammy felt for almost letting slip her earlier depreciating comment, her heart swelled with joy from being able to brag about how amazing Justin truly was."
0,Sammy looked over to Ceil.
0,"“If there is a job I think he would be perfect for, it would be protecting Ceil.”"
0,Ceil opened her mouth to speak in protest but fell silent in consternation.
0,"“I certainly see the merit in your suggestion,” Thanysa answered readily."
0,“I will bring it personally to the Thorn General.”
0,Sammy hugged Justin with a wide smile.
0,“You aren’t useless at all.”
1,"* * *
The combat lessons continued for a few hours every day at the hall."
0,Chloe joined beginning with the third lesson once the orphanage was established.
0,Ceil vouched for Chloe’s magic ability so she would not need to demonstrate its destructive power inside the pristine hall.
0,"Chloe showed greater aptitude for hand-to-hand combat than even Ceil, and Sammy knew that once her flames were added, she would become even more lethal."
0,"Thanysa even gave Chloe the rank of yeth, the second rank of the nameless martial art, after a brutal match that appeared as if Thanysa was trying to kill her."
0,"Day by day, Sammy improved in the spear, Ceil with her staff, and Chloe with unarmed combat."
0,"As Justin’s strength improved, he also picked up the spear, but his stamina never held for the full lesson."
0,"Because of Justin’s new role as Ceil’s protector, Thanysa also trained him as a shield bearer using a long, tapered shield."
0,Most of his time was spent in strength training so that he could move it quickly.
1,"Many of the estates were converted to farmland, and the Melians began growing their crops in preparation for the siege."
0,"In time, word came that the last town had fallen quickly due to the level of evacuation."
0,"Only one small village stood between the army of Tolmyur and Revlan, and that village had already been evacuated."
0,Tension rose in Revlan on a scale incomparable to their frantic preparations.
0,The enemy would be at their gates in a few short days.
0,"Chapter 15
“The Kissiae”"
1,“We have a thousand of our sisters ready to support you and our young empress.” An elderly yet still youthful-appearing dryad said with a bow.
0,A single large leaf grew from her forehead.
0,It extended over her head and down her back with slender yet full fronds sprouting along the spine to give the appearance of thick and verdant hair.
0,"She was a Foinikade, a palm dryad."
0,"The Hamadryad thanked the matriarch, and the Foinikade left the hollow."
0,She furrowed her brow in worry.
0,"The Itians were proficient in combat, but the Melians, who made up the bulk of her army, were pacifists by nature."
0,"Like the Melians, the Foinikades were also a pacifist tribe, which explained why they could only field so few and were the smallest reinforcements of the three tribes who had shown so far, even less than the Itians, who left many to delay the approach of the Tolmyur army, and the Fendamai, who were even further from Melia than the Itians."
0,The Hamadryad’s worry came from the lack of balance in her current forces.
0,"The Melians could use bows, but due to their pacifist nature, only the most eager or eccentric of them practiced the art."
0,"She could use their sheer numbers to overwhelm the army with arrows, but such a tactic could be fatal to her other forces who needed close proximity to deal damage, especially considering the life magic with which the Melians enhanced each arrow."
0,"On top of this, Melian arrows were wood-tipped, so any metal armor and some hardened leather could prevent the arrow from penetrating to the flesh were their magic could take effect."
0,"The Itians were more proficient with combat and well-practiced with their dances, but to make the most use of their abilities, they could not be in close proximity with any ally that could be hit by their incredibly long hair."
0,This was in direct conflict to the hot-headed Fendamai who used large numbers to overwhelm their opponents.
0,"They lacked any martial skills, but they raised some of the best shamans in all of Dhuillir, kissiae aside, and instead use their numbers to get close enough to make use of their magic."
0,"Luckily, being from Kedra, her incomplete pilgrimage took her through the three warrior tribes of Dhuillir, so they were under her influence; however, being at the beginning of her pilgrimage, they were the furthest from Melia and in the mountainous regions of eastern Dhuillir which was slow to travel, even for a dryad."
0,She was unsure if they would make it in time.
0,"Tolmyur’s armies had entered Melia traveling at a quickened pace, so she needed to intercept them within the next day or two."
0,"“What is on your mind,” Jenae asked standing in attention beside the entrance of the hollow."
0,"“Can we even do this,” the hamadryad asked, not to Jenae, herself, or anyone in particular."
0,She realized this was the first time in many years that she had outwardly shown any sign of weakness.
0,"“If you doubt yourself, your unease will spread to us all from our connection to you."
0,You mustn’t think of this battle as one which we could win or lose.
0,We are prepared to lay down our lives if only to provide Lady Ceil a moment of time and to weaken the army that would surely crush the remaining resistance in Vallen.”
0,"“In a battle without victory as an option, we most certainly cannot lose,” spoke a male voice from the entrance of the hollow."
0,"Debin arrived with his son, Benab, climbing over the roots behind him."
0,“Every minute we stall them and every life we take is a triumph.
0,You have no need to worry about victory or loss.”
0,"The hamadryad smiled, not expecting to be comforted by one who was not a dryad."
0,"“Debin, how progresses the training?”"
0,"“My time with the palace guard was short, so I could only teach what I know from hunting, but I must express my surprise in Melian archery."
0,They have such keen eyesight that they could spot a nut in the elbow of a tree at a hundred yards further than both my son and I and hit it with half as many attempts.
0,I can see now the wisdom of the past emperors and empresses who ordered the Melians to practice the bow.
0,If only they had more work ethic.
0,They could easily become the most lethal snipers on the continent.
0,"Regrettably, we do not have a full season or two to train them.”"
0,“How many would you say are proficient?” 
0,“Only a couple hundred.
0,"The rest can still use their bows, but I advised against applying their life magic to their arrows."
0,"Their fellow dryads will not slow from being struck by a simple arrow, but the Tolmyur soldiers will.”"
0,“Thank you for helping us in this battle.
0,I know that you wanted to avoid fighting if you could.”
0,Debin shook his head.
0,“I felt terrible leaving Lady Ceil to go to war on her own.
0,"We fled south from Vallen to avoid it, and now war has risen from the south to meet us again."
0,Involvement was unavoidable it seems.
0,Fate can be cruel.”
0,“What of your wife?” 
0,“She supports our involvement and will be in the care of the nymph couple in our absence.” 
0,"“The message,” Benab reminded his father."
0,“Of course.
0,The reason we came here was not to discuss the Melian’s archery training.
0,A messenger arrived where we were practicing and stated that a large group of dryads is approaching from the east.”
0,The Hamadryad searched her influence eastward out of fear that they were not her own.
0,What returned was the radiating warmth of support and eagerness that showed no fear of the coming battle.
0,It felt nostalgic.
0,"“You could have informed me that you were close, Jekeet."
0,I was about to send our forces into position without you.”
0,"“We wanted to make a dramatic entrance, but it seems a messenger slipped away from us.”"
0,“This is no time for games.” 
0,“What is war but a game with survival as the prize?” 
0,“Enduring your Kedran war games is bad enough.
0,I would hope that you are more professional on a true battlefield.
0,"Hamadryad, I am Takitan."
0,"We Pefkos and the Elatos are also here, numbering one hundred and thirty thousand, including your sister Kedros.”"
0,The hamadryad was stunned silent.
0,She never expected such a showing.
0,"Being a Kedros, she expected a large number from Kedra, but she never expected all three war tribes to send their full armies."
0,"Including the Melians, they now far outnumbered the estimated Tolmyur forces."
0,"“I am Namasee, the War Chieftain of the Elatos."
0,We were excited when we learned that our Grandmatriarch was from a warrior tribe.
0,"Our soldiers agreed unanimously to aid in the battle to see what terror could be wrought upon Tolmyur with a Kedros hamadryad in command, the first war Hamadryad since the unification of Dhuillir under the Amelian banner, but Jekeet informed us that you have no military or tactical education."
0,Is this true?”
0,“It is.
0,"Having mothered many children, my body aged quickly and so I was exempt from combat practice and training.”"
0,“Then on behalf of the Elatos I must express my concern in your leadership.
0,"As the senior War Chieftain, I request all command be given to me."
0,That is the requirement for our aid.”
0,Neither Jakeet nor Takitan spoke up after Namasee’s announcement.
0,They had agreed upon the arrangement beforehand.
0,The Hamadryad did not have so much pride that she would rather risk making foolish decisions on the battlefield than give up her command.
0,“I assume these conditions are agreeable?”
0,“They are better than I could have wished for.
0,Your support could mean the difference between stalling the Tolmyur army and defeating it.
0,Time is short.
0,I will explain the tribes we have and their numbers and can communicate your orders to our forces.
0,"If possible, we must strike within two days.”"
1,"* * *
The longer Bregon’s army traveled through Melia without encountering resistance, the more suspicious he became."
0,The three villages that his army passed were emptied.
0,"Given that there were never any structures and that dryads never worked the land, he only knew they were villages because the pairs of dryads he sent out as scouts to look out for any signs of hostility had informed him as such."
0,"He would simply laugh off his caution if nothing happened, and that was preferable compared to delays and further losses, but he knew the Melians were plotting something."
0,"The Symidian who always acted as the mouthpiece for the dryads when speaking to Bregon or relaying other messages, who he could now recognize after seeing her so often, suggested that the Melians fled."
0,"According to her, they were a pacifist tribe."
0,Bregon did not trust this explanation.
0,"After all, the Hamadryad was in Melia, and they would not leave her unguarded."
0,“Halt the march!”
0,The silencing of boots cascaded down the long train of soldiers and carts.
0,"The dryads shielding his army on all sides also stopped, but he could barely hear their footsteps despite their numbers and especially over the thundering of his own troops."
0,“Thees!” 
0,The Symidian from the forward dryad barrier weaved her way through the throng to approach Bregon.
0,"“What do you need, General Bregon?”"
0,The woman saluted in the manner she had seen his soldiers.
0,"It was a bit sloppy, but Bregon recognized that she was making an attempt to be formal given her unofficial position as spokesperson."
0,“A handful of scouts are too small a net.
0,I want the dryad barriers to spread out further.
0,"Keep the highest density near my soldiers, but send out half… no, a quarter of the dryads in all directions."
0,"Make certain that they stay within sight of no less than ten other dryads at all times, and disperse as far as that permits."
0,"Something is not right in Melia, and I want to know about it long before it happens."
0,"I want any threat, no matter how small, signaled back to me through the net.”"
0,“I will relay your orders immediately.” 
0,Thees ran back to her fellow dryads.
0,"After a few minutes of explanation, multiple dryads hurried to spread the message."
0,"Dryad networks were intriguing, and Bregon watched with an intellectual eye the messengers he could see from the road."
0,They spread like roots or perhaps the branches of a tree.
0,One dryad would relay her message to another group and then return.
0,The new group would then send out any number of dryads to propagate the information in the same manner.
0,"Instead of the Tolmyur method of sending a single messenger to relay the orders to all relevant parties, dryad messages spread at a staggering pace."
0,"The more the message spread, the faster and wider it spread until after only a brief span of time all the dryads were informed, and those on the outer perimeter of the protective dryad barrier began dispersing as per his instruction."
0,"Bregon could find issue with displacing large numbers of his soldiers when using this method of information transfer, and there was a risk of the message changing as it alternated messengers, but perhaps it could be used within the Tolmyur army after a few modifications."
0,Using simple messages like military hand signals might prevent alterations in the message as it spread.
0,Bregon expected his larger net to extend an extra mile on all sides.
0,"There were risks to thinning the defense if the Melians came after him in force using a single spear formation to penetrate through to reach the road, but the dryads did not appear to use traditional military formations, especially after witnessing the bizarre machinations of the Itians, and with the wide net, he hoped he would have enough forewarning to gather the dryads at the tip of the spear to blunt its edge should such a tactic be used."
0,Any other formation would force his dryads back to their position as a barrier for his men on the road.
0,His only worry was another unforeseeable tactic like that employed by the Itians.
0,He could not rule out the possibility that they could somehow still reach the road.
1,"The remainder of the afternoon and evening passed without event, and Bregon spent a restless night thinking about the following day."
0,"He pushed his army to keep a double pace, taking advantage of the dryad’s tireless stamina to pull the carts."
0,He would be rid of Melia and enter Vallen in two days.
0,The Mailan Hills of northern Melia were visible in the distance when setting up camp.
0,"If something was to happen, it would be then when his army reached the hills or after they were deep within."
1,"The road followed the path of easiest travel, forcing it to meander through the ravines and valleys around the numerous tors and other rocky outcroppings."
0,Even his net would be inhibited by such terrain.
0,He ordered his men to march with weapons drawn at normal pace to give time for any message of attack to reach him.
0,"Fire mages readied hailfire, each with three shieldmen for protection."
0,His wind mages were spread evenly along the road to deflect incoming arrows.
0,"He took every precaution, but nothing happened that day."
0,"If his army reached Vallen safely, he would laugh off his caution, but until then, his alert was as high as when he could hear the siren songs before the battle that destroyed his home village of Jurmorr during the Coastal Wars."
1,“I want dryads scouting the tops of every hill from here till the flatlands of Vallen.
0,"Spread the net further, half of the dryads keeping within sight of no less than five others."
0,We reach Vallen by sunset.
0,The Melians will attack before then.”
0,“They may not.
0,"They are pacifists,” Thees replied."
0,"“They will,” Bregon answered with a calm bluntness that forced the Symidian’s silence."
0,She saluted and left to relay the message.
0,"Bregon’s orders spread through the network, but it collided half-way with another message that overwhelmed his."
0,“Arrows from the south.
0,"Melian archers,” one of his men called from further down the train."
0,"The first sign of aggression, and from the rear."
0,Did he pass their offense due to his increased pace?
0,They may have thought he would continue at the rate he passed through Itia.
0,Bregon was not alarmed.
0,"On the contrary, he was overcome with relief as all his anxiety over the threat of attack left him all at once."
0,His wide net trailing his army would prevent the initial arrows from reaching his soldiers.
0,"There would be no losses among his men, but surely this would not be their only attempt."
0,"“Dryads along the borders, keep position."
0,"Those near the end, gather at the tail to prevent the Melian archers from approaching."
0,Wind mages ready updrafts to deflect arrows from the road.
0,We continue the march!”
0,"There was no word on numbers, only that there were arrows."
0,He expected more from another direction.
0,"“From the east,” a dryad called out."
0,“Numerous Fendamai.
0,The fringes are being overwhelmed.”
0,“Draw back to the defensive perimeter and hold them back in force.
0,"No matter their numbers, we should have more.”"
0,Bregon finally understood the reason for stalling.
0,The hamadryad was gathering forces.
0,The Melians attacking the south were attempting to pull away his forces and enable the Fendamai access to his soldiers.
1,He looked up through the dense trees to the rocky hills bordering the road on the east.
0,His dryads were pulling back to the downward slopes.
0,"Once he saw the first red-leafed Fendamai stand atop a tor, he realized the error in his orders."
0,“Dryads!
0,Take the hilltops!
0,Do not abandon them!”
0,"While the Fendamai appeared unarmed, a second form of dryad appeared behind them, Melians."
0,"The Fendamai jumped down the slope, and immediately the trees twisted and knotted together."
0,New and thick brush grew so rapidly that it immediately died from lack of nutrients as did the ground around it.
0,"A thick wall of foliage that prevented his dryads from retaking the nearby tor formed, and due to the loss of life in the plants and soil, his dryads could not make use of their own life magic to remove it."
0,“Fire mages!
0,Hailfire at will!
0,Wind mages!
0,Updra--” Bregon quickly turned his head as the first arrow bounced off the side of his barbute.
0,"Had he been a moment later in noticing, it would have perfectly entered the slit in the front."
0,"It was an incredibly lucky arrow for the distance from the top of the hill, or so he thought before a second, third, and fourth arrow hit his barbute, pauldron, and chestplate."
0,“Updraft!
0,Updraft!” Bregon hollered while he raised his shield with haste.
0,"The two wind mages near him billowed wind upward, sending approaching arrows over their mark to land on the far side of the road, but the protection was imperfect."
0,"Arrows that would hit the east side would not catch the draft, so those on the vulnerable side, including the wind mages creating the draft, could be hit."
0,“Shields to the east!”
0,"Fire mages launched their volleys of hailfire, but the tors atop the hills held little vegetation that could catch and provided ample cover for the archers."
0,"Occasionally, an arrow would slip through the draft."
0,"When Bregon saw the first soldier take an arrow in the hand, he realized the lethality of these wood-tipped projectiles."
0,"The man’s hand ruptured like a giant festering blister, removing it at the wrist."
0,"A second arrow hit a soldier in the neck, and gore shot up through his helmet."
0,None of the dryads on either side of the road were being harmed.
0,Each and every arrow was aimed perfectly for the road.
0,“Take back the hill!” 
0,Bregon chanced a glance at the hill from under his shield and found it quickly being covered by a smokescreen.
0,The dead tree wall caught from the hailfire and was burning rapidly.
0,"His dryads could no longer take the hill, but as the black smoke grew, his soldiers also received cover from the keen eyes of the archers."
0,"Arrows still fell, but the number aimed directly at him lessened."
0,“Move under the smoke cover!
0,"Fire mages, keep up hailfire!”"
0,"If his soldiers could follow the road around the next bend, the hill he lost in his folly would no longer be a threat, but there was still about four miles worth of his soldiers that needed to pass that bend."
0,“Triple march!
0,"Dryads, take the hills down the road and hold them!”"
0,The dryads at the forward barrier rushed ahead.
0,There were few of them compared to the number that traveled beside the road.
0,"With the offense on the east side, he could spare some of the west."
0,He made the order and watched the left flank thin as more dryads rushed ahead.
0,"He still had his net cast to the west, and no warnings had come."
1,No sooner had Bregon reached the bend than a message from the forward dryads returned warning of more Fendamai to the east swarming to take the hilltops on the other side of the bend.
0,"If he lost those hills, his army would be under fire the entire road."
0,"“West barrier, half of who remain rush ahead and assist!"
0,We must keep the hills!”
1,The scene atop the rocky hills that met Bregon around the bend was unlike any form of civilized warfare.
0,A swarm-like flood of red leaves fought like animals grasping at the bodies and wooden weapons of his dryads.
0,Any one of his dryads who was grappled by a Fendamai fell dead while two or three of his dryads were needed to overpower a single enemy.
0,"Those approaching the slaughter were being felled by the inhuman precision of arrows cast from an even further location, the bodies of his dryads bursting with each hit."
0,"Even without trees and brush to serve as a wall, the Fendamai alone were powerful enough a force at close combat to prevent anyone from reaching the archers."
0,The only saving grace was that the dryads were taking the brunt of those impossibly lethal arrows instead of his men.
0,Bregon looked back over his soldiers circling the bend and saw that several of them had been picked off by the arrows of the hill he lost.
0,His mistake may cost him hundreds of his men by the time the four-mile train finished rounding the bend.
0,“General Bregon!” Thees approached from ahead of his army with a terrified expression.
0,“Emergency!
0,Pefkos from the west!”
0,This was the first time any of the warnings had come as an emergency.
0,The Melian archers with their incredible precision were not labeled as an emergency by his dryads.
0,The Fendamai who appeared to overpower any of his dryads with life magic were not such a threat.
0,Who then were the Pefkos?
0,“What emergency?
0,What are the Pefkos?
0,Speak!”
0,"“One of the three warrior tribes,” Thees answered promptly."
0,“Do you know of their skills or tactics?”
0,“They are the only tribe that uses bladed weaponry provided by the empire.
0,They are physically weaker than most other dryads but are incredibly flexible and agile and train in combat as a profession.
0,"Of all the dryads in Dhuillir, they are the most proficient in weapons combat.”"
0,"“Bladed weaponry, as in swords?” Thees nodded."
0,"“Yes, sir.”"
0,"“If you can create shields from the trees, do so quickly."
0,"Front line shields followed by three rows of spears, each subsequent row of spears longer than the one before."
0,Use your life magic through your spear’s reach to stop them from breaking through.
0,"If they are weak, then your life magic should be effective.”"
0,"Thees immediately ran ahead down the road, now facing west, to relay Bregon’s formation orders."
0,A benefit of the dryads was their ability to fashion new weaponry at whim from nearby trees.
0,Such a rapid change in tactics would be impossible for his men.
0,"Spears were often superior to swords in open conflict, so he held confidence in the order, but unlike the ongoing struggle between his dryads and the Fendamai, he could not see the advance of the Pefkos or the progress of his dryads’ defense against them over the shallow hill."
0,The Pefkos attacked the moment he sent reinforcements from the west flank to support the struggle atop the hills against the Fendamai.
0,"This was precisely planned, drawing his forces to the east to thin his defense on the west."
0,"The hamadryad waited until his most vulnerable moment to send their trump card, the warrior tribe."
0,The hills and snaking road were disadvantageous to his troops.
0,"If they kept the triple pace, they would reach the flatlands of Vallen by midafternoon so long as his ever-thinning dryad barrier held."
0,"Once there, he would be able to make full use of his men and formations."
0,"He was confident that there in the open he could hold out against any number of dryads, especially with fire magic at his disposal."
0,He only needed to avoid direct confrontation on the road that would slow his advance.
1,The road curved once more and returned facing north.
0,Bregon glanced back at the visible two miles of his train and noticed in the distance that the red-leafed Fendamai topped the hill.
0,"His dryads lost, but unlike the first hill, there were no archers raining arrows down on his men."
0,"After eliminating a countless number of his dryads, they stood like sentinels and watched him flee."
0,What was their purpose in taking the hill if they were not going to use it like the first?
0,"Unless, it was to draw away and thin his dryads."
0,That thought was a revelation.
0,"If they wanted to pick off his army on the road, they could have employed far more archers, including the Fendamai who were content solely occupying his dryads."
0,"The Pefkos were a cause for fear in his dryads, and yet they had not overpowered his west flank and come to the road to attack."
0,"If his suspicions were correct, they were culling his west flank."
0,"When word came of a fourth type of dryad, the Foinikades, joining in the attack on the south and drawing even more of his dryad barrier into conflict, Bregon knew he fell into a trap."
0,His soldiers were never their target.
0,His dryads were.
0,"Each attack was designed to draw them away, either on their own or by his order, and whittle them down while simultaneously pushing his soldiers into a quicker march."
0,But to what end?
0,Where would the trap spring?
0,Only a few thousand dryads now led his march and fewer there were on the flanks.
0,There was no more net due to the bend.
0,His warning system was gone.
0,"“Fire mages, set the forest ablaze as we pass!"
0,We are nearing Vallen!
0,We must keep the enemy from the road!”
0,"Hailfire rained on the forest, but was slow to catch, sending up no more than a large smoke screen until the length of his train passed."
0,Only then did flames stretch to the canopies.
0,"He could not waste too much of his fire mage’s ven in the event that a controlled dryad attack on the road did happen, but hailfire used very little ven."
0,"Once the fires began to burn to cover their trail, they would fuel themselves."
0,He was close.
1,"Down the road in the distance, the hills stopped growing."
0,"In the coming hour, he would reach Vallen and the open fields."
0,He counted the remaining hills as he passed while word arrived of more of his dryad barrier at the rear being eliminated.
0,"If he did not hurry, the enemy would reach his soldiers before they reached less vulnerable terrain."
0,One more hill and one more bend.
0,"“General Bregon, we must stop!” Thees ran directly to Bregon, but he ignored her."
0,He could not halt the march.
0,She continued pleading to him.
0,“Our forward scouts have not returned to say the way is clear.
0,"I sent out more, but they have not returned either.”"
0,The Nuanae Range of the southern wilderlands was now visible past the ravine far on the horizon.
0,“We must clear the hills.
0,We will confront whatever awaits us on the fields of Vallen.”
1,All at once the forested ravine cleared into an open field.
0,"A forest bordered it on the far side, and the road bent around it to the east, but from here, he would travel west to catch up with the Vallen conquest."
0,No enemies were visible.
0,He moved his soldiers onto the open field with his dryad barrier surrounding them.
0,Only once out in the open did he notice just how few of his dryads remained.
0,"By sight, they numbered only a quarter of his army."
0,So many had been lost.
0,"“Sir, they are pushing harder from the rear!"
0,The dryads cannot hold them!” 
0,One of Bregon’s own soldiers ran to him with ill news of the dryad resistance’s desperate attempts to catch up and prevent as many of his soldiers as possible from reaching open terrain.
0,“Form ranks facing the ravine!
0,Shields and spears in front.
0,Fire mages at the rear to ready hailfire.
0,Dryads cover the flanks and move the carts to the back.
0,"Those holding the rear, slow the enemy as much as possible!"
0,We burn them to the ground here!”
0,The ranks formed quickly as his soldiers continued pouring out of the valley.
1,"Once the final group of soldiers and handcarts entered the field followed by a couple thousand dryads, Bregon swelled with confidence."
0,Now he could fight them as equals.
0,The beating of hollow wood thundered over the flatlands.
0,Bregon turned behind him to see tens of thousands of needle-haired dryads walking in ranks from the forest on the far side of the field.
0,They carried shields as tall as they with thick and stone-tipped spears in hand.
0,"From where the road curved east, a second army of familiar, long-haired dryads approached dragging trees behind them, Itians."
0,From the forest to the west approached a third and final army of dryads with dark green fans of scale-like needle hair.
0,"Once the trickle of his own dryads finished fleeing out of the ravine, far fewer than Bregon had hoped, a slow procession of singed and blackened dryads with longer needle-like hair exited the valley and formed their own ranks with tarnished swords in hand."
0,"“Bregon,” Thees spoke in fear, disregarding the formality of titles."
0,"“The Pefkos, Elatos, and Kedros are the strongest warrior tribes of Dhuillir.”"
0,“Perimeter formation!” Bregon called.
0,His army reacted immediately.
0,The flanks bent around in a circle with shields and spears on the outside.
0,Swords stood behind to eliminate those who broke through in the tight confines of close combat.
0,Mages and rangers held their positions in the center.
0,The earth mages quickly erected walls ten yards outside the perimeter with choke point openings for the mages and rangers to focus.
0,"He ordered the dryads to hold the walls and prevent entry if possible, but their numbers were far too few."
0,"They would be quickly overwhelmed, and every dryad positioned there knew it."
1,"“Tolmyur General,” called a voice from the forest side of the field."
0,"An elderly woman stood alone, one of the Elatos."
0,"“You may be a commander of humans, but you know nothing of the dryads."
0,You treat your conscripts as expendable foot soldiers instead of utilizing the individual strengths unique to each tribe.
0,Now you are on your own.
0,Show me now how humans do battle!”
0,Once again the hollow wood drums sounded over the field.
0,"Silent steps charged, impossible to know their number."
0,“Hailfire in all directions!” Bregon called.
0,Fire rained out from the center of the defensive circle.
0,"In return, a rain of arrows fell on his mages from the hills."
0,Bregon looked from beneath his shield to see the hilled forests moving with so many dryads that they nearly outnumbered the armies present on the field.
0,"Every Melian, Fendamai, and Foinikade had a bow almost as long as they were tall."
0,"With such a high volume of archers, not even his wind mages could stop the arrows."
0,“Hailfire to the hills!
0,Burn the archers!”
0,"His army was a still target, and even with the widespread destruction that hailfire could cause dryads, he knew the number of fire mages under his command could not stop such numbers quickly."
0,"The moment the first cudgel-bearing Kedros broke through the earthen wall, Bregon knew this was a losing battle."
1,"* * *
“Utilizing the Fendamai and Melians to eliminate most of his dryads worked brilliantly,” Namasee informed the hamadryad."
0,"“Without their numbers, this battle will be easy."
0,"In truth, I am a tad disappointed.”"
0,“Will you be victorious?” 
0,"“Eventually, but his perimeter is strong, and his fire mages are continuing to pose a problem."
0,Any single fire mage counts for a thousand of us.”
0,The hamadryad continued watching the battle through the senses of the numerous matriarchs included in the armies.
0,"She could not see the events unfold, but through thought and emotion, she knew the progress."
0,"At the beginning of the attack, there was close to a hundred thousand on Tolmyur’s side and twice that on hers."
0,Victory was assured.
0,“Urgent message!” 
0,Seiva stumbled over the roots as she entered the hollow.
0,“The kissiae are nearing the village and demand audience.”
0,“The kissiae?
0,How many?”
0,“All of them.” 
0,Seiva looked up at the hamadryad unable to hide the disbelief in her own words.
0,“What purpose would draw all kissiae out of Elos?
0,Send them here.” 
0,"The arrival of the Kissiae could either be the miracle they needed to end the war against Tolmyur, or it could be a terrible omen."
1,A procession of four hundred Eleionomai entered the village.
0,About forty kissiae were interspersed among them riding on their backs and shoulders.
0,A single kissiae unaided by one of the naiads crawled over the roots and entered the hollow.
0,"By appearance and an unmistakable aura of superiority emanating from her, the hamadryad knew this was the kissiae matriarch and a dryad ages older than her."
0,"“I am most humbled that you would see fit to seek audience with me, matriarch of the kissiae, but I must express my worry over what tidings caused you to depart from the safety of Elos.” "
0,"The hamadryad nodded her head, the sole motion of humility she could express with her body fused to the great cedar."
0,"“That cause could see the end of the Amelian Empire and all those in it,” the Kissiae warned."
0,“I speak of the Tolmyur Commanding General Jethro and the companions of young Empress Ceil.” 
0,The Kissiae matriarch placed her hand on the base of the hamadryad’s leg.
0,The hamadryad immediately felt a drain on her mind.
0,“You have gathered a large army to oppose Tolmyur in support of the empress and her companions.” The kissiae’s eyes narrowed.
0,“You are aware that her companions are not of this world.”
0,"The hamadryad knew she could hide nothing from a kissiae matriarch, so she answered in the affirmative."
0,“They have the support of the Sprite Arkhon.”
0,“Did you not know that interference between worlds is banned by the Gods?
0,You should have expended every effort to eliminate those trespassers the moment they entered this village.”
0,“The Sprite Arkhon is elder to us all.
0,"I am obligated to obey,” the hamadryad replied."
0,“The Sprite Arkhon was there at the fall of the ancient civilization at the hands of the Gods.
0,That same threat now hangs over us all once again.
0,"I do not know what the Arkhon is scheming, but we must put an end to it before we all suffer."
0,"I understand that betraying the trust the empress has in you is difficult, but it must be done."
0,"In return for your cooperation in eliminating the empress and her companions, the kissiae are prepared to transplant you in the hamadryads’ grove and spread your influence throughout all of Dhuillir to unify us against this threat.”"
0,“Is transplanting a hamadryad possible?” 
0,“It is trivial for us.” 
0,"The promise of becoming a legitimate hamadryad was indeed tempting, but the motives of the Sprite Arkhon were a worry that the Hamadryad could not ignore."
0,The sprites were tasked with the maintenance of this world and had been since the beginning of time.
0,The Arkhon had given warnings in the past to protect the peoples of the Amelian Empire.
0,She doubted he would purposely take action that would lead to its destruction.
0,This should be known to the kissiae as well.
0,"“While I am most grateful for your generous offer, I must decline."
0,I trust the Sprite Arkhon.”
0,“Then my hand is forced.” 
0,The kissiae matriarch sprung up and clung to the hamadryad.
0,Janae and Seiva immediately rushed to the hamadryad’s aid but were beheaded by the Eleionomai guard before they could reach her.
0,The kissiae placed her hand on the hamadryad’s forehead.
0,"Before the kissiae could take any action, the hamadryad broke her connection with the ongoing battle to focus all her life magic on offence against the kissiae, but her resistance was like a single tree attempting to hold back a landslide."
0,Her mind was plucked from its roots and enveloped in immense anguish.
1,"* * *
Bregon swung his heavy, broad-leafed spear to crush through an Elatos shield and then thrust it through her neck, nearly severing her head."
0,"He changed quickly to his next target, a Pefkos who brandished her sword against a nearby fire mage."
0,He impaled her exposed back and flung her over the melee into the Kedros pouring through the gap in the wall.
0,His dryads had only held for a moment.
0,His shield perimeter was broken in two locations allowing access to his few vital fire mages within.
0,The rain of arrows continued all the while with the wind mages making every effort to direct them into the oncoming dryads.
0,"Unlike the first arrows that were lethal on contact, these were unenhanced."
0,The dryads who were hit ignored them and continued their assault.
0,He and his fellow giants in their full plate were the only soldiers who could ignore the arrows and come to the aid of the more overwhelmed parties.
0,The dwarves in their half plate kept up the magic offense being too immobile to change location quickly through the melee.
0,"Over half his minums were injured by the arrows that made it through their shield cover, and his humans holding the perimeter were falling quickly to the three warrior tribes who were equal to them in combat but far superior in both stamina and vitality, being able to ignore blows that would be lethal to his men."
0,"There was one more set of dryads who were not present in the melee, the Itians."
0,Bregon cast his gaze toward the eastward road and saw that the trees they dragged had been transplanted in a line.
0,"They bent back unnaturally, and with a snap, dozens of Itians flew over the wall and past the perimeter into the mages in the center."
0,"This was a repeat of Itia, and now Bregon knew the absurd methods the Itians employed."
0,"The suicidal Itians landed on the minums and dwarves, knocking back the shields and making them vulnerable to the rain of arrows."
0,Those Itians still able to move began to claw their way to skin and flesh or made use of their long whip-like hair to strike with their caustic life magic.
0,Bregon switched from eliminating the dryads who broke through the perimeter to protecting his mages from the Itians.
0,The dryad commander criticized that he did not utilize the strengths of his conscripted dryads to his advantage.
0,"Seeing the methods of the Itians, he wondered what he could have done or what unique tactics his dryads could make use of, but now it was too late."
0,His only thought was how long he could hold.
0,"If he could protect his fire mages long enough, the enemy dryads would continue taking incurable damage."
0,That was his only hope to survive.
0,Passing through Fiorrae may have been the better option.
1,All at once the rain of arrows ceased.
0,No more Itians fell on his soldiers.
0,"The enemy dryads cried out and writhed on the ground, unable to attack."
0,"They held their heads, clawing at their scalps in anguish."
0,“Quickly!
0,Behead them all!”
0,Every soldier even if injured did not miss this miraculous opportunity.
0,Even the mages drew their swords and hurried through the chaos to sever the necks of the downed dryads.
0,"Within minutes, all enemy dryads inside the walls were disposed."
0,"His earth mages lowered the walls, and the army spread out."
0,Tens of thousands of dryads were eliminated in an instant until the fields were clear.
0,"Not wanting to waste the opportunity, Bregon turned his army towards the hills."
0,"His worn and injured soldiers pressed forward and climbed the smoldering slopes, disposing of the numerous archers they passed."
0,The army that outnumbered his by double or more was eliminated in an hour’s time.
1,“What happened?” Bregon looked back at his soldiers gathered in the field.
0,"Those of his dryads who had avoided the slaughter of the war tribes, numbering no more than a few thousand, were unaffected by this strange disease that had infested the opposition so suddenly."
0,“General Bregon!
0,Come quick!” 
0,One of the dryads approached and called him to an enemy dryad who had been cut down but was still alive.
0,She spoke through the gargles of the life sap filling her mouth.
0,“The kissiae… request Bregon’s… in… central… village.”
0,“Here as well!” 
0,One of his soldiers called him over to another living dryad.
0,“The Ki… Bregon’s presence… central… Melian…”
0,Bregon called over the nearest dryad.
0,“Where is the central Melian village?”
0,“Would it not be in central Melia?”
0,“Is there any dryad who can act as a guide?!”
0,"The few dryads who heard stared at him, but none spoke up."
0,Melia was far too large to search for a single village.
0,“Guide…” The injured dryad pointed to the road entering the valley between the hills.
0,There alone stood a Melian with her head cocked to the side walking with an unnatural gait.
0,Bregon called for some giants and uninjured minum fire mages to accompany him.
0,"“Dryads, heal my men to the best of your abilities and then tend to your own injuries.”"
0,"“Sir, what of the fallen dryads?"
0,Do we use them for food?” one of his lieutenants asked.
0,"Bregon looked over the devastation, and his eyes caught sight of one dryad."
0,"He walked over to her and saw the familiar face of a Symidian with her eyes open, frozen in a death stare."
0,“Separate the enemy from those who sided with us.
0,The enemy will become food stores for the battles ahead.
0,"As for the conscripted dryads, let their kin here decide how best you should treat their dead."
0,We would have never survived if not for their sacrifice.
0,My summon to the central village may take a few days.
0,Make camp and prepare funeral pyres for our fallen.
0,Rest until I return but keep vigilance in case more dryads arrive.”
0,He led his small band of soldiers to the awaiting Melian.
0,"She did not attack or flee, only repeating the words “guide” and “follow.” "
0,"The moment he ordered her to move, she turned her back to him and walked onward through the smoking road."
1,"* * *
Reaching the central Melian village took four days at the slow pace the guide walked."
0,"Unlike the other dryad villages devoid of structures, numerous huts surrounded a towering cedar in the center."
0,Most the residents of the village were gone save a few Melians who avoided Bregon and his men.
0,"Apparently the disease affecting the Melians had passed, being replaced by fear of him and those now occupying the village."
0,The majority of the populous were humanoids with white silken gowns and turquoise hair.
0,"At their hips, radiant silver blades were sheathed."
0,Bregon immediately recognized the resfahil blade and naiad bearers.
0,"He was on alert, but none of them drew their swords on his approach."
0,"The moment one of the naiads met him, his Melian guide fell to the earth, dead."
0,“I am General Bregon of Tolmyur.
0,"The kissiae have called me here,” Bregon announced."
0,The naiad bowed.
0,“This way.
0,"Follow me,” she spoke in an archaic human tongue."
0,She led him through the village to the cedar growing out of a stout tree in the center.
0,The closer he neared the cedar the clearer he could see that it was sickly.
0,"The boughs of fan-like needles wilted, and many broke from their branches as he watched."
1,"He stepped up over the large roots exiting the hollow and was met by the hamadryad, or what remained of her."
0,"Her body was shriveled and lifeless, her hollow eyes staring blankly at his feet."
0,Clinging to her upstretched arms was a much smaller dryad with long ivy hair that hung down to the floor of the hollow.
0,"She was elderly, but the fury in her eyes gave an overwhelming presence that made her feel immortal."
0,“Are you the kissiae who summoned me?” Bregon asked.
0,His men readied their weapons to prepare against any hostility that might follow the kissiae’s antagonizing gaze.
0,"The kissiae glared back at his men, and even the most seasoned of his giants shrunk back on instinct."
0,This was not a being to threaten.
0,“I have come to give a warning to ensure the survival of both my kind and your nation.
0,Your Commanding General has committed an egregious sin by invading another world.
0,"Likewise, the young empress whom you seek has committed that same sin by accepting the aid of the trespassers from the world you invaded."
0,The kissiae will aid in your capture and execution of the empress and her companions.
0,We will do so without need of repayment for our aid.
0,"However, should your Commanding General ever return to Whinhlem, you must execute him for breaking the laws of this world."
0,"If you do not, we will be your next enemies and rid you from Amel so that the retribution of the gods only befalls Tolmyur.”"
0,"Chapter 16
“The Arrival of Tolmyur”"
1,Byurk looked upon the walls of Revlan rising just above the forest canopy far in the distance.
0,"The city knew his army was there, yet they never left their fortifications to meet them in battle."
0,"Like the previous cities, this would be a siege."
0,"His army camped far enough from the city that magic and arrows would never reach them, but Byurk knew from personal experience the lethality of the silently flying fairies."
0,"At night, camp pyres were lit to give plentiful visibility, and the watch was tripled with both archers and mages at the ready."
0,"At least fairy wings emitted a subdued glow, making them easier to spot at night."
0,"For now, he was stalling."
0,"Due to the hastened evacuation of the previous three villages and cities, plenty of food remained abandoned, but it could only buy his army about twenty days at most."
0,"Including his current food stores, he would need to assault the city after about thirty days to give ample time for them to take the city before his food supply ran too low to last the return trip to Amel."
0,Thirty days was too short for a prolonged siege against a city.
0,"He sent a message to Amel for reinforcements, but a messenger had yet to arrive informing him whether a contingent force would be sent."
0,"He estimated the city’s forces at about fifty thousand, but if he wanted to include all civilians, the number could increase as far as two hundred thousand."
0,"If their numbers were that large, his army was too small to take the city without careful planning and strategy, but the benefit of stalling longer would increase, and perhaps their food stores would run out before his."
0,"He could starve them first and then attack the weakened city, using the extra time to wait for word of reinforcements from Amel."
0,"“We have done nothing but sit here for three days,” Lieutenant Soppet protested."
0,“We should act before they have further time to prepare.”
0,Byurk ignored his lieutenant’s complaints for a moment and continued staring at the walls.
0,"From his distance, he could just barely see the shadow of a gathering of soldiers atop it eyeing his camp in return."
0,“This will not be like the previous cities.
0,It is far more defended.
0,We cannot risk another attack like Nalain.
0,"With their numbers, we would lose."
0,You have grown too accustomed to quick massacres.
0,This siege will be different.”
0,“Then are we to sit here?” 
0,The method of leadership and warfare between Lieutenant Soppet and Byurk could not have been more different.
0,Byurk made every effort to minimize the losses of his own army throughout the campaign in Vallen due to how prolonged he knew it would be.
0,"After his injury that sent him back to Amel, Lieutenant Soppet took command and spread through Vallen like the flash flood of the first heavy rain following a prolonged drought."
0,"His losses were greater for each city taken, but in return, the fairies never had the time to prepare a solid defense."
0,"This also saved on provisions, lessening the time taken to finish the campaign."
0,"However, if they kept moving at Byurk’s pace and with his planning, they would have had more soldiers, and the enemy never would have chosen to abandon cities and gather in a single fortress, using the added manpower to further fortify it."
0,It would have been a city like all the rest.
0,Revlan was the result of Lieutenant Soppet’s haste.
0,"One could argue which method was more productive, but now that they reached the final city in Vallen, and such a fortified city of Lieutenant Soppet’s creation, Lieutenant Soppet’s methods were ill-matched to conquer it."
0,“No.
0,We will send out patrols starting tomorrow.
0,"At our distance, the siege cannot begin."
0,"They still have freedom to gather supplies, and there is always the chance that the widow of the emperor might flee the city if she is there and we delay further."
0,"Fleeing north to the wilderlands might still be beneficial for us with the large bounty Jethro placed on her head, but if she flees south to Fiorrae, we will have trouble."
0,"Once we make our presence known, I will call for a meeting with the city’s commander.”"
0,“You still wish to end this by negotiation?
0,You are wasting your time.
0,"You offered mercy to every village, town, and city you encountered, and they still fought us to the last life."
0,You can’t possibly think Revlan will be any different.”
0,Byurk shook his head.
0,“I never wanted this to be genocide.
0,The fairies are stubborn and prideful.
0,"They would rather die than be taken captive, but we should give them the option to surrender, nonetheless."
0,There are few of their kind left.
0,It would be to their benefit to comply.
0,And we must make certain the widow is in the city.”
1,"* * *
Ceil stood atop the wall walk on the east side of the city."
0,"The military camp just north of her had been evacuated into the city the day before, now looking more akin to a ghost town."
0,"The reason was the new camp that rose in the distance the day before the evacuation, one belonging to the enemy who pursued her."
0,"The city was already filled to bursting, so most of the soldiers slept atop the walls."
0,Those on the eastern walls slept little due to the ever-present feeling of the enemy breathing down their necks.
0,"At least with the continued deaths of the unstable refugees, the spaces between the walls emptied as the refugees were moved to the large courtyard, making room for the soldiers."
0,"“Do you think they will attack,” Ceil asked Dharin."
0,“Not yet.
0,"I sent some wings to scout their numbers, and they do not have enough soldiers to assault the city safely."
0,"As we feared, this will be a prolonged confrontation.”"
0,“Would it be possible to meet them on the battlefield and use our numbers to overwhelm them?” 
0,Dharin shook his head.
0,"“With our lack of trained soldiers, we would lose in open confrontation."
0,Our best tactic is to hold the city against them.”
0,"“They cannot assault us, and we cannot meet them in combat.” Ceil ground her teeth."
0,“A deadlock.”
0,“We can assume for now that the city is safe.
0,They will act in the coming days when their own investigation of our defenses finishes.
0,Their commander should have also noticed the deadlock and will scheme to circumvent it.
0,There is little we can do until we surmise their intentions or they make them clear to us.”
1,Ceil turned away from the enemy camp and weaved through the hunkered and resting soldiers.
0,"There was barely room to set each foot, but the soldiers made effort to shift as much as was possible out of her way."
0,Her guard followed close behind and matched her steps as her steps were truly the only places to set their feet.
0,"The crowded streets of the city were no better, and Ceil could barely walk without brushing shoulders with someone."
0,At least the citizens were too occupied to yell accusations at her for bringing this destruction upon them.
0,"The enemy was here, and each family and refugee had their own preparations to make."
0,"Unlike the rest of the city, the inside of the curtain wall was uncrowded, so Ceil could breathe easier."
0,"She felt it a bit unfair that the nobles refused to let anyone inside, but at the same time she enjoyed the far calmer atmosphere, so she could not judge them harshly."
0,"If she was forced to stay on the crowded streets amid sweat, body heat, and filth, she knew her emotions would break."
0,"After all, she caused this solely by existing, and that thought plagued her every time she stepped outside the tranquil central district."
1,Ceil bid farewell to her guards and walked immediately to the garden where Justin and Sammy sat with Lemi.
0,“How are you feeling?”
0,"“I keep saying I’m fine,” Lemi pouted."
0,"A few days ago, Lemi was wracked with an unbearable pain that had her clawing at her hair and face."
0,"Ceil, Sammy, and Justin were forced to restrain her while Tyree tried desperately to investigate the cause and heal her if possible."
0,"It continued late into the evening but eventually subsided, leaving Lemi exhausted and bedridden for two days."
0,Lemi requested to be moved to the garden so she could soak in the sun to speed her recovery and remained there even after she felt better.
0,“Do you have any idea what the cause could have been?
0,"Something you ate, maybe?"
0,Did you drink too much wine?”
0,"“We already asked that,” Sammy replied."
0,“And we’ve been preventing her from drinking the wine unless it was watered down.”
0,"“And if Tyree is correct and there are no Melian diseases that matched the symptoms, what could have caused it?"
0,Are you sure you do not feel anything different?” Ceil asked.
0,Lemi shook her head.
0,“And none of the other Dryads have caught it or experienced the same symptoms…”
0,"“Must have been some freak thing,” Sammy mused."
0,“Sudden pain like that doesn’t happen without reason.
0,Could the Sprite Arkhon have done something?”
0,"“I tested that too, but she can’t understand other languages, so we can at least rule out that it’s the same as what happened to me.” "
0,“That does not mean he could not have done something else.” 
0,Sammy looked up at the sky in thought.
0,“Arkhon are you here?”
0,“You cannot seriously expect the Sprite Arkhon to appear when you call him.” 
0,Sammy ignored Ceil’s rebuke and waited.
0,"She could not explain her reason, but she had a hunch."
0,"Slowly, a warm wind enveloped the area, and a wind sprite appeared in the center of the group, stunning Ceil silent."
0,"Sammy was likewise amazed, but the one who appeared was not the sprite Arkhon but a female wind sprite."
0,"“Sorry, but the Arkhon is preoccupied at the moment, so he sent me in his place."
0,I am Ephora.”
0,“Can you seriously summon a sprite on whim?!” 
0,Ceil looked at Sammy rather exasperated.
0,"“Oh, no."
0,We are not some elemental you can summon.
0,"We are simply observing Sammy here, so of course we could hear her.” "
0,"The sprite flitted around the group, and Sammy’s eyes followed her."
0,She was finally able to see them if only just a little.
0,“Observing me?
0,Why?”
0,"“Sorry, but I am not permitted to explain further."
0,Did you have a question?”
0,Sammy looked over at Lemi and noticed Justin turning his head away from the Sprite.
0,"This was the same reaction he had to Lemi and the other Melians when they were uncovered, out of respect to them as women."
0,A small suspicion rose in Sammy’s mind.
0,“Are the sprites naked?”
0,"“Is that your question,” Ephora asked with a laugh."
0,"“Our forms are remnants from when we had physical bodies, and we appear no different than you, so you could say that we are."
0,You may consider us souls who have chosen the elements as our covering instead of flesh.
0,"As the elements, we have no need for clothing.”"
0,"“Justin, can you see her?!”"
0,Justin looked back at Sammy surprised.
0,“Of course.
0,"I mean, are you unable to?”"
0,“Can you see her clearly?
0,Not as a blur or transparent silhouette or anything else?”
0,“Yah. She’s not transparent at all.”
0,Now Ceil was surprised.
0,"She could see the sprites clearly, but they were always transparent, lacking any physical appearance."
0,“That must be because his ven signature is very similar to ours.” Ephora explained.
0,"“Those who are sensitive to ven or meditate enough to increase their sensitivity can see us in a way, but because their signature is different, they cannot truly see us.”"
0,“So Justin has absolutely zero recognition of his ven but he can see you because his ven is the same?” Sammy shook her head in disbelief.
0,"All her effort to increase her own sensitivity, and Justin could see the sprites naturally."
0,"“If that is all the questions you have, I will be on my way.”"
0,"“Wait,” Ceil called."
0,“Can the sprites help us in this battle?”
0,“No.
0,We have a strong non-interference restriction instated by Gyea.
0,"We are permitted to interact with the races as one of them, but we cannot interfere.”"
0,“Gyea?
0,"One of the two titan guardians of Whinhlem?” Ceil asked, amazed."
0,“Is there anything else?” Ephora asked.
0,Sammy breathed a sigh.
0,"“Sorry for all the odd questions, but the true reason I called you was to ask if you knew why Lemi was in such pain a few days ago."
0,"The sprites are skilled with life magic, so I was hoping you might be able to discover something that the dryad’s missed.”"
0,"“Oh, I know the reason."
0,A powerful kissiae caused it.
0,"It affected many dryads throughout most of northern Dhuillir, but you have no need to worry."
0,It cannot happen again.
0,"However, in the Arkhon’s place I will give you a warning."
0,Beware the kissiae.
0,"They are acting on their own to your demise, visitors from Earth, and they have sided with the Tolmyur armies."
0,"They will join the battle against you, but do not anger them."
0,Farewell.”
0,Ephora disappeared without another word.
0,“Who are the kissiae?” Sammy asked.
0,"Instead of answering, Ceil had a question of her own."
0,“Did she just use the name of your world?
0,Did the sprites know all along you were not from Whinhlem?”
0,"“I kind of suspected the Arkhon knew, so it’s no surprise that she did as well."
0,What about the kissiae?”
0,Ceil sighed.
0,"The Arkhon must have known everything about Sammy and her friends from the beginning, leaving her to discover it on her own."
0,"“They are ivy dryads that live in Elos,” Lemi replied."
0,“They are one of the oldest species of dryad and also the strongest.
0,She said that they sided with Tolmyur.
0,Isn’t that bad?”
0,"“I will inform Dharin,” Ceil said as she ran for the manor."
1,"* * *
“Ten parties of five hundred are a bit excessive for mere scouts,” Lieutenant Soppet said as he watched the second-to-last party leave camp."
0,“Such large parties will not be very mobile.
0,"If your purpose is a preemptive attack, you should send more to show our strength.”"
0,"“Hardly the point,” Byurk replied as he finished lacing his leather armor to join the final scouting party."
0,“They already know our numbers.
0,The purpose is to create unease while we observe the fortifications and surrounding terrain as well as prevent them from leaving the city to gather provisions.
0,I expect many in the city to be troubled while our morale is high.
0,Further breaking the enemy’s spirits will improve our chances of victory.
0,The size of the parties is meant to deter them from any attempted retaliation.
0,The parties were instructed to stay outside arrow and magic range.
0,"If they send out a sizable force to defeat the scouts safely, the scouts will be more mobile and should have no problem escaping.”"
0,Byurk walked to the head of the final party composed solely of humans for increased mobility.
0,"Despite being a minum, no one doubted his ability to keep pace."
0,“Scouting rotations are four-hour shifts.
0,"When the first group returns, make certain the next is prepared."
0,I want no gaps in our pressure.”
0,“Understood.” 
0,"Byurk dug his heel into the soil, and with a swift step propelled lightly by earth magic, he led his party in a jog out of the camp."
1,The flat terrain marbled with dense forests and open plains created a unique battlefield.
0,"While mobility decreased in the forests, his soldiers could advance while the thick cover of the canopy hid both their numbers and direction."
0,The perfectly flat fields then provided quick movement for attack and retreat as well as giving ample room for use of magic and archery.
0,Much of the south side of the city was forested including a small section on the north side.
0,The northeast was open field with an abandoned military camp that his men could not enter without drawing within attack range.
0,The west side was the largest field expanding far into the distance.
0,"Crops were growing in various stages of harvest, having been abandoned when his soldiers arrived."
0,"Byurk met up with one of the nearby scouting groups and instructed them to scavenge the farmlands for abandoned provisions, gather wood for war ladders, and burn everything else."
0,The black smoke would be a perfect show for those cowering in the sunken city.
0,"If he wanted a proper assault, his best choice would be to attack from the west, but the gatehouse there was small, and from the appearance of the inner wall behind it, there was no immediate entrance to the city."
0,"There, he had three options."
0,His soldiers could move through the vulnerable gap between the two walls to reach the gate into the city.
0,They could carry in taller war ladders to climb the inner wall or bridge the gap between the walks of the two walls.
0,"Lastly, they could buy time for earth mages to tear down the walls."
0,"For such large fortifications, that would be a time-consuming task while under constant fire, and his supply of earth mages was low."
0,"This made the gatehouse on the southeast side the best location for entering the city, but the dense forests provided poor visibility of the walls from under the canopy."
0,"The trees could provide some shelter, but his soldiers would be unable to see the attacks raining down from the walls."
1,"While contemplating how to assault the main gatehouse, Byurk noticed a large blue bird flying into the city."
0,He recognized it immediately as the Habha trained by the widow of the emperor.
0,It carried some animal half its size in its talons.
0,He halted his party and waited while the soldiers on the wall stared him down in the distance.
0,"After a few minutes, the Habha rose once more and flew southwest at incredible speed."
0,It was gathering provisions for the city.
0,The beast it carried could provide a day’s meal for a hundred if rationed.
0,"Even if it could hunt twenty times in one day, that was hardly enough to feed an overcrowded city, but it would decrease the consumption of their stored provisions."
0,"Byurk had no way of knowing yet how much food was stored in the city, but just seeing the Habha made him feel that starving the city may be more difficult than originally expected."
1,"Back at the camp, Byurk listened to the reports of each initial scouting group and those who returned after each subsequent shift."
0,"“The city is heavily defended, more so than expected,” Lieutenant Mackrum, second lieutenant under Lieutenant Soppet, said after hearing the most recent report from a party that risked sending a pair of scouts under the forest canopy to gain a closer view of the wall and southeast gatehouse."
0,"“The portcullis is reinforced with iron, and the tunnel is far too long."
0,"If it has murder holes, our bodies could fill the tunnel before we manage to make it through,” Lieutenant Soppet added."
0,“We cannot ignore the possibility of Oreads hiding in the stone.
0,"There were three in Nalain, and we lost many soldiers to them alone.”"
0,Byurk remained silent while his Lieutenants discussed how best to assault the city.
0,His hand moved in quick motions as he fashioned a letter to Revlan’s commander in clean Elven.
0,"On the morrow, he would send out two messengers carrying Tolmyur’s banner to deliver it to the main gatehouse, earth mages specialized in reinforcement magic in case the enemy decided to shoot them down after the message was delivered."
1,"* * *
The front door of the manor swung open with a loud bang against the wall, interrupting breakfast."
0,“Dharin!
0,A letter from Captain Byurk of the Tolmyur army!” 
0,Kiri appeared in the lounge carrying a rolled sheet of parchment tied with a crude strip of leather.
0,“Byurk?
0,I thought we assassinated him.
0,He survived?” 
0,"The tactics of the invading army changed drastically after the assassination, a sure sign that a new commander was leading the campaign."
0,"The tactics never reverted, so they had assumed that the commander died."
0,Dharin stood and quickly retrieved the message.
0,“Is it…”
0,"“A call for a meeting of commanders on the eastward field,” Dharin interrupted Kiri."
0,“He details the troops he will bring for protection and asks that we match the numbers.
0,Both he and his Lieutenant will be present.”
0,"“There is nothing to discuss,” Ceil said, leaning back on her cushion."
0,“They did not stop their campaign once they learned I was not in Vallen.
0,They will not stop now that I am here.”
0,"“He specifically mentions his agreement with you to meet him before the battle and demands your presence,” Dharin explained after reading further."
0,“So the commander you met in Dhuillir was Captain Byurk.”
0,“Let me see.” 
0,Ceil grabbed the parchment and scanned it while Sammy looked over her shoulder.
0,“I can understand languages but can’t read them?” Sammy groaned.
0,“I can teach you later.”
0,Ceil continued reading.
0,“That makes no sense.
0,He already returned Justin.
0,We have no reason to meet.”
0,"“Probably to make sure you are here to uphold your end of the agreement,” Sammy surmised."
0,"“That is most probable,” Dharin agreed."
0,“The time is set for noon today.
0,That gives us little time to prepare.”
0,"“Are you going with,” Sammy asked Ceil."
0,"“I have nothing to discuss with him, but I will show him I have not run.”"
0,“Then we should retrieve your armor.
0,"It should be finished by now,” Dharin said."
0,“I will have Thanysa take you while I prepare our escort and discuss the meeting with the council.”
0,Dharin drained his goblet and grabbed one more strip of cured meat before following Kiri out the front door.
1,"Less than an hour later, Thanysa arrived with the usual four High Elf guards to escort Ceil to the forge."
0,"Despite Ceil’s assurance that no one else needed to follow, everyone but Lemi decided to join."
0,"Unlike their first visit to the forge, the open storefront was frantic with craftsman and soldiers moving out the completed weaponry."
0,The large crates of spear tips and arrowheads were replaced by even larger racks piled so full of spears that they rolled onto the ground whenever more were added.
0,“Thanysa!
0,"I’m glad you have decided to visit again, but as you can see, we are quite busy.”"
0,"Sarodyn carried a large barrel full of arrows on his shoulder, the fletching just visible above the rim."
0,He placed it with two similar barrels on a handcart for two fairy soldiers to haul off.
0,“We are here for Her Highness’s order.”
0,“The young empress?” 
0,Sarodyn looked down at Ceil.
0,"“Oh, the Thorn General’s order."
0,Understood.
0,Wait to the side to stay out of the way.
0,I will be but a moment.”
1,Ceil’s company moved closer to one of the pillars by the entrance to the forge.
0,"Although Sarodyn stated he would be brief, he left them waiting long enough for beads of sweat to pour down everyone’s flushed faces, everyone but Chloe, but her face was flushed for other reasons."
0,"The craftsmen inside the forge worked at twice the pace of those outside moving the finished product to the walls to arm the soldiers, and Ceil had to wonder if the haste of the smiths was due to them currently lacking enough arms should the enemy launch an immediate attack."
0,"Traveling through the city, she could see very few of the citizens armed, and the locations where weapons were to be distributed had yet to be set up."
0,This meant they had not fully armed the soldiers.
0,"The city was not yet ready for war, and this worried her."
0,“Sorry for the delay.
0,"I finished a few days back, so somebody had moved it to make room."
0,I had to beat a few skulls to find out where.” 
0,Sarodyn set down a case and removed a set of armor.
0,"“Here you are, lass."
0,A set of plated jack leather armor.
0,"There was not enough resfahil for the full chainmail the Thorn General requested even if we diluted the alloy to its limit, so we went for a jack with small resfahil plates interspersed through the fabric."
0,"With his permission, of course."
0,I feel full mail may have been too heavy for you anyway.”
0,"“I thought royalty was not supposed to wear resfahil in case of an emergency,” Ceil asked."
0,"“There is not a single spatial mage in the entire city,” Thanysa admitted reluctantly."
0,"“We have a single spatial pixy, but we cannot use him for your protection or escape."
0,"Without barriers, resfahil is our best hope to protect you from magic.”"
0,“Try it on so we can adjust the fit.
0,"I padded the inside of both the jack and skirt to keep it comfortable, but you should still wear a fabric skirt underneath.”"
0,Sarodyn handed a leather skirt to Thanysa who wrapped it around Ceil’s waist and tied it down the back.
0,The vertical plats of leather were connected between by purple linen to provide for mobility and prevent the skirt from being too stiff.
0,The jack was also overlaid with the same purple linen sewn with diamond patterns to attach the small resfahil plates on the inside.
0,"“There was a small note from Kiri in the order to color it purple if possible, but dies and stains can weaken leather, so I used purple fabric where fabric was needed."
0,"The leather collar, bracers, and cuffs are also imprinted with the Amelian insignia."
0,A bit of regal flair for our young empress.”
0,"“I…” Ceil was about to say she would rather not stand out in such gaudy colors, but she found the bright shade of purple beautiful, and like the dress provided her by her maid--her cousin--in the Gallanvale, she knew this armor was crafted out of consideration for her."
0,“Thank you.”
0,“I regret that I could not have done more.
0,How’s the fit?”
0,"Thanysa finished lacing the back of the jack, so Ceil raised her arms, twisted at the waist, and lifted her knees."
0,"“Fit looks good,” Thanysa said after inspecting each motion."
0,"“We may not have time today, but you should wear it during our training sessions to get a feel for the added weight and decreased mobility.”"
0,Ceil turned to Sammy and spread her arms lightly.
0,"“It looks great,” she exclaimed with a smile."
0,"“I like the color,” Chloe said, catching on to the flow of conversation despite being unable to understand it."
0,"“Seems practical,” Justin finished, and Sammy batted him lightly on the arm."
0,“What kind of complement is that?” Sammy chastised.
0,“It is fine.
0,"Armor is meant to be practical,” Ceil said."
0,"“Sammy, can you throw one of your water orbs at me, the forceful kind?”"
0,“You serious?” 
0,Ceil nodded.
0,"Sammy took a few steps back, taking care not to get in anyone’s way."
0,She conjured a sphere of water and tossed it at the center of Ceil’s chest.
0,"Instead of bursting, the water simply hit her chest, serving no greater purpose than cooling Ceil off from the heat of the forge."
0,"“The water did not dissipate but the effect of the attack was mitigated,” Ceil said after wiping her face."
0,“Any magic attack strong enough to pierce the armor and touch the resfahil should be nullified.
0,"Others that don’t pierce it should be mitigated like that water orb, so it should protect against magically created fire, but remember that resfahil is nothing but metal against the natural elements."
0,"Otherwise we couldn’t refine it,” Sarodyn guffawed."
0,"“Thank you again,” Ceil said after turning to face Sarodyn."
0,“It was my pleasure to craft our new empress’s first set of regal armor.”
0,“I will let you return to your work.” 
0,"Thanysa waved to her father as she walked off, once again ignoring his plea for her to visit for reasons other than work."
1,"“May I make a request,” Thanysa asked Ceil."
0,“Of course.”
0,"“I will bring this to the Thorn General, but I should ask you and your companions first."
0,"When you go with the Thorn General to meet the Tolmyur commander, I would like you to take Sir Justin and Lady Chloe with you.”"
0,“What about me?” Sammy asked.
0,"“Lady Chloe is the most powerful mage in the city, and without a spatial mage, Sir Justin may be the best protection we can provide Her Highness with only a twenty-soldier escort."
0,"I mean no offense, but there is nothing you can offer in the discussions.”"
0,"“Yes there is,” Sammy protested."
0,“I understand every language on Whinhlem.
0,Every single one.
0,They don’t know that.
0,"If they try to speak among themselves in a different language, I can tell you what they say.”"
0,"“No, Sammy."
0,"I agree with Chloe and Justin’s involvement, but should the discussions result in conflict, you would be a liability."
0,"You have improved, but you are still nothing compared to a trained soldier, especially those whom the commander will bring for these discussions.”"
0,“Her Highness is correct.
0,"Just as we will be bringing our best, he will as well."
0,"Lady Sammy, you can join me atop the walk to watch the discussions.”"
0,Perhaps speaking to them in their own language could help the discussions progress smoothly.
0,Perhaps she could convince them not to assault the city and find a different way to resolve the conflict without further bloodshed.
0,"Sammy tried desperately to think of a reason for her to take part, but each thought she stumbled upon fell short to her own reasoning."
0,"The commander spoke fluent Elven in her memory of the central Melian village, and what could she even say to convince them that the genocide that was nearly complete should end?"
0,"Sammy fell silent in dejection after once again failing to be useful to the conflict, but her deeply rooted desire to leave her mark on the conflict burned stronger within her because of it."
1,"Once Ceil explained Thanysa’s suggestion to Chloe and Justin, they agreed readily."
0,Thanysa brought them to the inner sanctum of the temple to be part of the continued discussions about the meeting of commanders.
0,"When Chloe and Justin’s involvement was presented, there were some on the council who still found issue with their human origins and questioned their loyalty, claiming that this would be the perfect opportunity to betray Ceil and hand her over to the enemy, but when Ceil pounded her staff into the ground, the dissenting voices silenced in fear, remembering the brutal execution of the Rose General."
0,"These humans were Ceil’s chosen companions, and while the thought that their empress would choose to associate with humans over her fellow elfkind raised doubts of Ceil’s loyalty to the fairy conflict, they assented unanimously."
1,The remaining time before the meeting of commanders was spent organizing the guard and a small army of one thousand who would stay back in the abandoned camp to come to the aid of Ceil and her guard should conflict arise.
0,"The soldiers of the guard were hand-selected by Dharin, but Ceil was asked to speak with each of them to ratify the selection or reject any individual with whom she found fault."
0,"Once finished, Ceil, her two companions, the Thorn General, and their guard left the safety of the walls of Revlan for the eastern fields."
1,"* * *
Byurk led the march out of his camp."
0,"His guard consisted of two of his veteran giants, two dwarven combat mages, five human shieldsmen, six swordsmen, and seven archers."
0,"Aside from his giants, the other soldiers were of average or lower skill selected by Lieutenant Soppet to minimize losses should the worst happen."
0,"Byurk was the best mage of his army, so the numbers were solely a deterrent against hostility."
0,He was confident that he could protect himself so long as there was no enemy far more powerful present.
0,A cold breeze cut across the field from the north.
0,"The long stalks of grass waved in ripples down the field, nearly obscuring the party approaching on the far end."
0,He recognized one of them immediately and realized that no small number of men he brought could stop the enemy should they decide to attack.
0,"Standing far across the field with the enemy procession was an orange-haired woman, the otherworld fire mage of extraordinary power."
0,"Her presence alone meant that peaceful negotiations were his responsibility, because he and his men would be in the greatest danger should violence break out."
0,"“Remember that this is a conversation, not an attack,” Byurk reminded his lieutenant."
0,“They overpower us by a grave margin.”
0,"“We should have brought our elite,” Lieutenant Soppet complained."
0,"“If their general is seasoned, he would recognize that the men we brought are not our finest."
0,Are these discussions not to intimidate them?”
0,"“No, we are here for information, whatever we can glean.” "
0,"“For one as ruthless as you are in combat, your strategy in war is awfully precautious.” "
0,"“With our current strength, caution is most important,” Byurk reminded."
1,"At about a hundred yards distant from the opposing party, Byurk halted his march."
0,"He eyed the widow’s guard, consisting of mostly High Elves with four winged fairies hovering in the air slightly above."
0,"Four bodies stood before the guard: the otherworld fire mage on the left, a short, elderly fairy to her right, the emperor’s widow, and then her shield bearer, possibly half fairy, half elf by his stature."
0,"A line of soldiers stood in rank in front of the camp at the end of the field behind them, an extra precaution Byurk felt was not needed with that fire mage present."
0,"To match numbers of the meeting parties, he called one of his elite giants and one of the dwarven battle mages, an earth mage specialized in area defense."
0,"He did not doubt his giant’s ability to take down the shield bearer, but he knew the dwarf was unlikely to be able to fully protect them against the firepower of that mage."
0,"He stepped out with his four across the field, and their four approached to meet him midway."
0,"Having called the meeting, Byurk spoke first."
0,"“I am Captain Byurk of Tolmyur, commander in charge of the Vallen campaign."
0,"As you can see, your assassination has failed, and I am in good health."
0,Such tactics will not work a second time.
0,With me is Lieutenant Soppet who led the campaign during my absence.”
0,"Lieutenant Soppet straightened his back, standing tall for a minum, and grinned at the fairy general who could do nothing to stop his rapid advance across Vallen."
0,"“Dharin, Thorn General of the fairies of Vallen,” the elderly fairy said."
0,"“With me are those who I assume need no introduction, Her Highness, Empress Ceil and her companions whom you met in Melia of Dhuillir.”"
0,"“I desire to know the name of the otherworld fire mage beside you, Thorn General."
0,I have lost many valiant men to her power.”
0,"“Chloe Hearn,” the widow answered with pride."
0,“You would do well to remember it.”
0,"“If I may,” Lieutenant Soppet cut in, surprising Byurk although he refrained from showing it."
0,“I have encountered many in my destruction of Vallen who have claimed to be the widow of the Amelian emperor as you do now.
0,They have all proven to be imposters and have received adequate punishment for their deception.”
0,"The widow visibly tensed, and her ire leaked into her expression."
0,"If she visited any of the fallen cities or villages on her way to Revlan, Byurk was certain she would have seen Lieutenant Soppet’s abhorrent displays."
0,"“From what I have learned of your previous encounters with Captain Byurk, you have provided no evidence of the truth of your claim as widow of Emperor Yuro."
0,"We demand that you prove it here, or the destruction that follows the widow may not end with Revlan.”"
0,“And how would I prove my identity to you?” the widow asked.
0,"“Your tails,” Lieutenant Soppet replied."
0,Byurk focused to control his anger.
0,"They were not in a position to antagonize the enemy, but stopping his Lieutenant now would undermine his standing in these discussions, revealing that his side was either not unified or that he lacked the command to control his men."
0,"However, if his lieutenant’s intimidation bore success, it set him as dominant at the start of the discussions whereas their refusal would not harm either side’s position."
0,"“The empress is under no obligation to expose herself for your gratification,” the Thorn General replied, but the widow extended her hand to stop him."
0,"“No, it is fine."
0,"Dharin, untie me.” "
0,"The Thorn General hesitated, but the widow asserted her decision."
0,“Do it.”
0,He moved behind her and unlaced the back of her hardened leather skirt letting it slide down her legs to the ground.
0,"A brown, silken underskirt extended just past the calves of her legs."
0,"She turned her back to Byurk, raised the back of her skirt, and lifted her two long and elegant tails of perfectly even length from the fabric cradle, letting them slowly slide over her hand."
0,"“Is that what you wanted to see, commander?” "
0,"The widow, now unquestionable in her claim, returned her tails to their cradle and ordered the Thorn General to lace up the back of her leather skirt once more."
0,"Though she stood confident, her face was flushed red from the embarrassment of the act."
0,"“Let it be known that win or lose, I fought you in battle, and the destruction of my people in your pursuit of my life ends here in Vallen.”"
0,"“Having born witness, we accept your claim as widow of the late emperor,” Lieutenant Soppet replied with a sneer."
0,"“And I commend you for upholding your end of our agreement in Melia and not returning into hiding,” Byurk added, playing off his lieutenant’s script."
0,"“Even without the return of Justin, I would have come."
0,I can run no longer.”
0,"“Admirable, but as you can see, your companion is not with me.” "
0,"The widow held out her left hand to her shield bearer, presenting him to Byurk."
0,“He arrived safely in Revlan.
0,This ends our agreement.”
0,Byurk suppressed the utter shock rising from within his chest.
0,He looked up into the shaded face under the leather cowl of the shield bearer.
0,"He was not as sickly as before, but the features were unmistakable."
0,How could an unconscious human survive buried under a mountain of rubble submerged in water?
0,"Even with the aid of that dryad, he should not have survived."
0,Byurk was surer now more than ever that this otherworlder was more of a threat than even the fire mage.
0,"In order to survive such an ordeal, he had to be as powerful as Jethro."
0,"Byurk was somewhat accustomed to the capabilities of spatial magic due to his long association with Jethro, but he knew little about time magic."
0,That otherworlder’s presence alone made this siege far to grave a risk with his current forces.
0,"Instead of information, Byurk needed to resolve this conflict through negotiation if at all possible."
0,"“Our agreement may be finished, but I must once again impress upon you the direness of your situation."
0,"Among all of the nations that once allied themselves under the Amelian banner, only the fairies remain in opposition to Tolmyur, and their numbers are few, the main body of survivors huddling in fear within the walled city behind you."
0,"When we parted in Melia, I sent an urgent request to Amel for reinforcements, and they are on their way as we speak."
0,"If you hope to defeat us, your sole chance of survival lies in surrender or open combat on these fields."
0,"We have ample provisions to starve your city until our reinforcements arrive, upon which we will have numbers sufficient to overwhelm you.”"
0,"“If you want to defeat us, you will have no choice but to throw your corpses at our walls,” the Thorn General retorted."
0,"Given the Thorn General’s confidence, Byurk was certain that their store of provisions was indeed sufficient, and his refusal to fight in open combat hinted that his armies lacked the manpower or training to be victorious no matter his skill in command and tactics."
0,"If they had sufficient otherworlders at their command, a victory on the field would be trivial for them, so their numbers may yet be small."
0,“Then you have chosen your inevitable demise and an endangerment to the race of fairies.
0,"There is certainly a small number of your kind interspersed throughout the continent, but without a homeland where you may gather, in not so many generations the few of your people who remain will be absorbed into the other races and cease to be."
0,"While this would be fitting irony for the elves, I am not so petty that I would also wish it upon their next of kin."
0,I offer you the chance to save your people and end this conflict so that you might rebuild and reclaim your homeland.
0,We will not go so far as ordering you to swear allegiance to Tolmyur.
0,"All we ask is that you surrender the widow of the emperor, and we will see to your survival and expend all efforts to aid in your recovery.”"
0,The widow gripped the staff in her right hand with white knuckles but did not speak.
0,"If the Thorn General demanded it, she would have no other choice but to surrender herself."
0,"Her eyes bore the anger seething within, but she did not turn to look at the Thorn General to plead her safety."
0,"“If fate has chosen our race to end, we will see that our end be glorious, fallen in epic battle sung for all of history so that we may never be forgotten!”"
0,"Byurk’s eyes narrowed, focusing on the weak flame of doubt flickering in the eyes of the widow."
0,"“Having heard the Thorn General’s declaration, do you wish that fate upon them?"
0,"Do you also desire the genocide of the fairies, Empress Ceil?"
0,You were willing to sacrifice the Melians for your benefit.
0,Are you just as willing to sacrifice the fairies?
0,I make you the same offer I did in Melia.
0,Surrender yourself and show that you do care for your subjects.”
0,The widow’s lips quivered.
0,"She looked back at her guard, the line of soldiers before the camp, and the city walls topped with so many soldiers there was not a single gap for light between them."
0,She could spare them all.
0,One to two hundred thousand lives and the continuation of a now endangered race for the life of one.
0,"Her life bore an immense weight, and Byurk wanted her to be crushed beneath it."
0,"“Instead of history remembering that you fought me in battle at the cost of the noble race of fairies, would your legacy not be grander if you gave your life to ensure their survival instead?”"
0,"“Enough!” Dharin called, but the widow did not turn from gazing at the walled city."
0,"“The future rests on her survival, a future of which you know nothing."
0,"If our sacrifice is a means to that end, we will gladly accept it, but know here and now that we will not yield."
0,"If you want her, every man, woman, and child of Revlan will stand in your path.”"
0,Byurk did not care about the Thorn General’s reply.
0,The Thorn General would never yield.
0,He wanted the widow’s.
0,"“Empress Ceil, your decision,” Byurk demanded."
0,"The widow remained silent, but Byurk could see she would soon break the longer her gaze lingered on the overcrowded city behind her."
0,“You will not have her.”
0,"The Thorn General Drew his sword and extended it out in front of the wife, blocking her should she decide to surrender."
0,“So be it.” 
1,Byurk turned his back and walked away.
0,"He wanted to push harder, but even if he convinced the widow, nothing could be done."
0,The fairies were prepared to hold her in the city against her will if needed.
0,Any attempt to aid the widow in her surrender by fighting against the Thorn General here in the field would result in his certain destruction at the hands of Chloe Hearn.
0,"At least he was able to obtain some vital information, so he considered the discussion a success."
0,One of the shieldsmen among their waiting guard gave the hand signal requesting orders.
0,Lieutenant Soppet returned a brief signal in front of his chest that Byurk did not catch.
0,Two wind longbowman peaked out between the shields.
0,Byurk panicked.
0,He turned towards the enemy just as two wind-imbued arrows flew close enough overhead for him to feel the trail of wind.
0,“You fool!” 
0,"With impossible timing, the otherworld shieldbearer swung his long and slender shield to catch the first arrow while simultaneously grabbing the widow and pulling her to the ground to avoid the second that passed just between their heads."
0,A surprise attack may have worked against a normal time mage but not one who could ignore channeling time.
0,"Now that his side made the first move, they were committed."
0,Byurk stamped his foot into the ground to raise a spike beneath the fallen widow and otherworlder.
0,"The time mage pushed the wife aside in time for her to avoid the spike while he caught it on his shield, flipping him back several feet into the air and into a crumpled heap on the ground."
0,The Thorn General grabbed the widow with his feathered wings spread and lunged back to meet the four rapidly approaching winged fairies.
0,"Unable to bear her weight alone, he passed her off to them, and they carried her as they weaved to and fro close to the ground to better avoid the arrows his archers rapidly fired."
0,“Not her!
0,Shoot th--” 
0,Byurk’s words caught in his throat.
0,Chloe Hearn stepped forward with her arms engulfed in flames like wings of destruction unfurled before him.
0,His giant elite caught his collar and threw him back with incredible strength as the mage’s hand swung together into a deafening clap.
0,The explosion robbed him of his breath and propelled him further.
0,"He spun through the air, unable to know sky from earth, and the moment he caught his bearings, he reinforced his body with earth magic and struck his foot out to obliterate the rapidly approaching soil into fine sand."
1,"* * *
“Justin!”"
0,“Lady Sammy!
0,Wait!” Thanysa called out to Sammy but could not avail her reason.
0,The woman who had just watched the man she loved take a direct attack from the enemy commander pushed her way through the riled soldiers and out of Thanysa’s reach.
0,"Thanysa jumped from the wall and slid down its steep slope, aided by her earth magic."
0,"The moment she touched ground, she lunged forward with pillars of earth propelling each step."
0,The four fairies carrying Empress Ceil passed above her into the safety of the walled city.
0,She quickly passed the soldiers now in full charge to support the Thorn General and his guard.
0,"A second grand explosion erupted that nearly robbed Thanysa of her breath, even from her distance."
0,"A monstrous plume of flame billowed into the sky, many times larger than the first."
0,"She trusted Empress Ceil’s word about Lady Chloe’s power, but she never could have imagined it would be of such a magnitude."
0,"If Lady Chloe was an enemy, Revlan would fall in a single night."
0,Their walls could never hold against such power.
0,The guard kept a wide breadth from the explosion and rushed forward to try and cut off the fleeing enemy.
0,"The Thorn General was with Justin, but he was unable to move the unconscious man."
0,Thanysa rushed to his aid.
0,"His shield bent inward from the impact of the spike, but thankfully Sir Justin lived."
0,“He is far too heavy for me.
0,"Take him,” Dharin ordered."
0,“What of Lady Chloe?”
0,“She is within the flames.
0,We must trust that she can withstand her own fire.
0,I will call the soldiers back.
0,"If they extend too far, they could get caught by Tolmyur’s armies and overwhelmed.”"
0,The Thorn General flew off to intercept his forward guard.
0,Thanysa wrapped Justin’s arm over her shoulder and lifted him.
0,"He weighed as much or more than a fully armored High Elf, far more than anyone his size in studded leather should weigh."
0,"She crouched down and swung his other arm over her other shoulder, pulling him close to her back."
0,"There she waited, hoping that Lady Chloe would return from within the inferno."
0,"When she felt she could wait no longer, when she could see the Thorn General appear with his guard from around the flames, a burning figure walked out from within."
0,"Chloe stumbled over the grass, lighting it with every step until she collapsed to her knees, hunched over."
0,"“Water,” the flaming body called in desperation."
0,"“Chloe is immensely powerful, no doubt the strongest fire mage on the continent, but she has a tendency to overheat."
0,"If we are to use her in the war, we need to keep an ice mage on hand to cool her off.” "
0,"Thanysa thought Ceil’s praise and warning about her companion was exaggeration, but it was all true."
0,She called to the approaching army.
0,“Douse Lady Chloe in water!
0,Use ice!
0,Quickly!”
0,"Several mages rapidly surrounded the burning body, unable to approach too near for the intensity of the heat."
0,Together they released fountains of water and mists of frost.
0,"Steam erupted, enshrouding the field in a dense fog."
0,"Lady Chloe hunched over on her elbows, naked and shaking."
0,"Unable to bear her agony any longer, she collapsed to the ground."
0,“What kind of self-destructive power is this?”
0,"Both of Empress Ceil’s companions successfully saved her life, but in doing so they incapacitated themselves."
0,"If this happened in the midst of battle, their lives would be forfeit."
0,There could be none now who would ever question these humans’ loyalty to the empress and this war.
0,Thanysa passed Justin off to two High Elves while two others lifted Chloe.
0,"“Return to the city,” the Thorn General called, and immediately the army was in full retreat."
1,"* * *
Byurk awoke to the sight of his tent ceiling in dim torchlight."
0,"Remembering the events caused by his foolish Lieutenant, he shot up from his bed and called for a soldier."
0,"To his surprise, his body did not ache."
0,He had no injuries that he could feel.
0,"Even when turning the ground to sand on impact, he expected to have a few broken bones."
0,“Sir.”
0,Lieutenant Mackrum stood in the entryway relieved to see his captain awake.
0,A pale-skinned dryad sat in the corner beside the entrance on a stool.
0,"“Tell me what happened, and explain this dryad.”"
0,“Lieutenant Soppet set up the assassination as you ordered but we were unable to eliminate the widow before she escaped.” 
0,Byurk swallowed his shout that he never gave such an order.
0,"Had he died in that fire, Lieutenant Soppet’s aggression and lack of foresight could have lost them this war."
0,"Lieutenant Mackrum would have been the only remaining officer, and he was still unskilled."
0,“And the casualties?”
0,“Lieutenant Soppet died in the initial blast.
0,Your guard rushed to your aid but most of them died in the second.
0,"Despite grave injuries, the few who survived were able to retrieve you and carry you back to camp."
0,Only one of them lived long enough to receive treatment.”
0,“The dryad?” 
0,“She healed you as well as the sole surviving shieldsman.
0,She arrived four hours ago bearing a message from General Bregon.
0,He will arrive in eight days with an army from Amel.
0,Accompanying him is an even larger army of dryads from Dhuillir led by the kissiae.
0,"They have joined the war on our side to eliminate the otherworlders, and General Bregon has relinquished command of our armies to their matriarch.”"

“Second Chances”
Sammy
The army retrieved Chloe and Justin safely, and they were carried immediately to Tyree."
0,Chloe suffered first- and second-degree burns covering most of her body.
0,"The two massive explosions had used up all her ven, and she passed out from mental trauma and pain cause by a combination of the burns and ven exhaustion."
0,"Her burns were trivial to heal, so all she needed was to rest for the night."
0,"Justin received heavy bruising on his right forearm and chest, a mild fracture on that same arm, and three cracked ribs."
0,He also received a slight concussion from landing on the ground after being thrown.
0,The benign damage of his cracked ribs and fracture was mended quickly.
0,"Bruises, like burns, were trivial to heal, but concussions were a far more delicate matter that took Tyree’s time and patience."
0,"Like Chloe, Justin was left to rest overnight with the promise that he would return to perfect health in the morning aside from the appearance of the bruising that would fade naturally."
1,"From the moment Justin woke the next morning, Sammy clung to him and would not let go."
0,Visions of him being shot and the following months of his pain and anguish--the numerous days she feared that she would wake to him dead the next morning--returned in force.
0,"She was the one who requested that Justin should be charged with Ceil’s protection, but she never expected that would send him directly into danger’s path where he would need to sacrifice himself for Ceil as he had for her."
0,"She seethed inside, hating herself for making that suggestion, but when she saw Ceil bow to the floor in front of Chloe and Justin before breakfast, she knew she had made the correct decision."
0,Ceil was alive because of Justin.
0,“Thank you for saving me.
0,"If not for you both, I never could have survived that attack.”"
0,Chloe grew flustered and coaxed Ceil to lift her head.
0,“You don’t need to thank us.
0,We volunteered specifically for that reason.
0,They were sure to try something.”
0,"“I was a bit worried, but I’m glad it worked out,” Justin said with a smile."
0,“Come back to the table and eat.”
0,Ceil lifted her head and looked at the splotches of fresh pink skin on Chloe’s face and the large bruise on Justin’s outstretched arm.
0,She ignored Justin’s hand and crawled forward to sit on her cushion next to the table.
0,"“I must say that I am quite astounded at the power of Lady Chloe and Sir Justin,” Dharin said once breakfast began."
0,“Is this the strength of those from their world?”
0,"“No,” Sammy replied quickly."
0,“I am normal when it comes to magic.
0,"Justin and Chloe were recognized by the Arkhon, so it’s understandable that they would be different.”"
0,"“That does not mean anything,” Ceil said."
0,"“I am supposedly special according to him, but my skill in life magic is laughable.”"
0,“You are the empress.
0,"That makes you plenty special,” Sammy retorted."
0,"“You are blessed to have such companions,” Dharin said."
0,“You should treasure them.”
0,Sammy drew closer to Justin and squeezed the arm she clung to.
0,"Justin turned to her and smiled, confused by the sudden affection being unable to understand the conversation."
0,Sammy smiled back and rested her head on his shoulder.
0,Ceil watched the exchange quizzically.
0,"“Sammy, have you spoken with him about your misunderstandings in the past,” she asked in the fairy language so Justin could not understand the conversation even with his limited knowledge of elven."
0,"“No…” Sammy nervously rolled a hard, winter berry under her forefinger on the table."
0,“Not yet.”
0,“You never know what could happen in war.
0,"Should the worst come to pass, you do not want anything left unsaid, for both your sakes."
0,Take what happened yesterday as a sign that you cannot wait any longer.”
0,"Sammy had countless moments when she could have asked, but she was scared."
0,She knew Justin for nearly a year in what she felt was a trusting and loving relationship.
0,"If after all that time he could not tell her no matter how often she pleaded, why would he suddenly open up to her now?"
0,And there were some things that people wanted to keep secret even from those they love most.
0,Especially from those they love most.
0,"Whatever Justin could be hiding might be something he feared would change how Sammy felt about him, and the more he cared for her, the more he would want that secret to remain hidden."
0,"She did not know if this was the case, but she could at least make the commitment now that no matter what she heard, she would accept it and not judge Justin because of it."
0,"“I’ll speak with him tonight,” Sammy said."
0,"“Before that, in the evening, can I talk with you and Tyree in the garden?”"
0,"“Of course, if the city is not attacked by then,” Ceil replied."
1,"* * *
Sammy sat next to Ceil on a stone bench in a corner of Dharin’s garden."
0,"The only others present were Tyree and Lemi, who now spent all her time in the garden instead of going inside."
0,"She asked if she could be a part of whatever they were discussing, and Sammy saw no reason to deny her."
0,"The other Melians were absent, each one caring for a field in one of the other manors."
0,"Tae remained due to her job as Tyree’s caretaker, but she excused herself, not wanting to intrude on the private conversation."
0,"Sammy felt a bit embarrassed, but those present were the only people she could ask, at least comfortably, Ceil because she was Sammy’s friend, and Tyree because she was essentially Justin’s doctor and a specialist in life magic."
0,"“Ceil and Lemi kind of know the situation between Justin and me,” Sammy began, speaking to Tyree to quickly fill her in."
0,"“We were a couple in the past, but that ended when I tried to have sex with him."
0,"He rejected me, and our relationship fell apart after that."
0,"I never found out why, but I’m going to ask him tonight.”"
0,Sammy took a deep breath to both calm down and mentally prepare.
0,"“I plan on going all out, and if things work out, I was wondering… Does your world have any contraceptives or contraceptive magic?”"
0,"Lemi grew confused by the question, and Tyree gave no reaction."
0,Ceil sighed and shook her head.
0,"Sammy almost thought that was her answer, that there were none."
0,“Is that what you called us together to ask?
0,"You could have asked me this morning during breakfast,” Ceil said."
0,“This is not a topic that should be brought up while eating together with everyone.
0,What would Dharin have thought?”
0,“No one would have found issue with it.
0,I do not doubt Dharin would have been delighted to answer any questions you had.” 
0,"“Such desires become even more commonplace before any major battle,” Tyree explained, “and I do not doubt that should the city survive, many children will be born before the change of the season, even between those without any prior relationship.” "
0,"“To answer your question, yes, there is contraceptive magic,” Ceil replied."
0,“I can perform it for you whenever you need.”
0,"Sammy sighed in relief, making Ceil mildly annoyed in return."
0,“Was that really such a big worry?
0,You love Justin.
0,It is not like you are being forced into such acts with someone you dislike.”
0,“That’s not the point.
0,"We are going to be involved in a lot of fighting and whatever is going to happen in the future, right?"
0,Getting pregnant during a war would be bad.”
0,"“You don’t need to be involved in any of it, Sammy."
0,"If you want to start a family, you can."
0,"Since you are not important to what is coming, that may be the better option for you.”"
0,“No way.
0,I’m staying involved as long as Justin and Chloe are.”
0,Ceil shook her head once more.
0,"“Fine, fine."
0,Just come to me afterwards if you want it done.” 
0,She stood and walked back to the manor without another word.
0,"Sammy knew that Ceil wanted to end Sammy’s involvement because she cared about her, but she could not deny that she felt slightly annoyed by Ceil’s attitude."
0,"There was one more question Sammy wanted to ask, and this was the main reason she wanted Tyree present."
0,“Is Justin healthy enough for sex now?”
0,“What do you mean?
0,"Even in the condition he arrived, he could have done his part."
0,"When producing offspring, the male body is able to allocate sufficient resources for the task even if a moment from death.” "
0,"That’s not what I mean, Sammy wanted to say, but she knew Tyree understood."
0,"Justin was still thin and lacked stamina, and he was recently injured."
0,She wanted to know if anything she did could hurt him.
0,"“You have no need to worry,” Tyree said to put Sammy’s worries to rest."
0,“I’ll send Justin out here for his evening checkup.
0,"When you are done, can you tell him to see me in our room?”"
0,“I will.” 
0,“Thank you.” 
0,Sammy stood and stretched to loosen up from sitting hunched.
1,"When she passed through the gate, Lemi ran after her and pulled her by the arm to the garden on the other side of the walkway out of earshot of Tyree."
0,"“Sammy,” Lemi began sheepishly."
0,"There was guilt in her countenance, and Sammy knew that a confession would soon follow."
0,“Is being pregnant during a war really that bad?”
0,Sammy looked Lemi in the eyes.
0,“Lemi… are you?”
0,Lemi grabbed Sammy’s hand and used it to brush the side of her hair.
0,Countless tiny petals fell like drifting snow knocked loose from a heavy-laden branch.
0,Lemi watched them fall in surprise herself.
0,“Since when?
0,When did you find out?”
0,"Lemi hesitated, and her lips quickly dried from nerves."
0,“I found out when I checked in Melia.
0,I lied.
0,I wanted to go with you no matter what.
0,I’m sorry…”
0,Sammy pulled Lemi in and hugged her.
0,"She wanted to tell her how angry she was that she lied about something so important, but she couldn’t."
0,It felt wrong.
0,She separated from Lemi and placed her hand gently on the girl’s stomach.
0,"“Congratulations,” she said with a warm and loving smile."
0,"Tears welled in Lemi’s eyes, and a wide toothy smile grew across her face."
0,"This was a joyous time for any anthousai, and Lemi had to stifle her joy in secret because no one was supposed to know."
0,She wrapped her arms around Sammy’s neck and spun in circles with giggling laughter.
0,"“What are you going to do,” Sammy said once the spinning ended."
0,“I’m staying with you.
0,I’ll figure something out.
0,I’ll make it work.
0,I promise!”
0,“You are going to have to tell Ceil and everyone else.” 
0,“Can I wait until after the battle is over?” 
0,“Yah.
0,I’ll keep it a secret too.”
0,“Our secret!” 
0,Lemi pranced in a circle around Sammy.
0,She then grabbed Sammy’s shoulders from behind and pushed her towards the walkway.
0,“Go see Justin.
0,We can be mothers together!”
0,“Say it so loud and everyone will hear.
0,"No more wine, okay?” "
0,“Okay!” 
0,Sammy turned and gave Lemi one more hug before leaving the garden.
1,"Sammy sent Justin to meet Tyree in the garden for his checkup, something that he felt he no longer needed but Sammy continued insisting upon, especially now that he had to wear armor and carry a heavy shield to protect Ceil."
0,His muscles were still in a state of atrophy compared to how he was before they found themselves in Whinhlem.
0,She rushed up the spiral staircase to her room.
0,"Coby was perched sleeping by the window, so she woke him and asked that he rest in Lemi’s room instead, just for tonight."
0,He cried in protest but hopped to the room across the hall.
0,"Now alone, Sammy grew nervous."
0,"She could not think how to bridge the topic of their past or even ask that he be with her for the night, not as they had every night but in the most intimate of meanings, something she had yearned for desperately for such a long time."
0,All she knew was that she should not repeat how she acted the night Justin walked out on her in anger.
0,No assertion.
0,No aggression.
0,"She laid out the bed mats as she did every evening and wrapped the blanket around her, her clothes stashed in the corner of the room out of sight."
0,There she sat in the center of her mat and waited.
0,Each minute her anxiety built until she could no longer stop her shoulders from shaking.
0,Am I making a mistake?
0,This could ruin the relationship I managed to rebuild with Justin.
0,"The moment Sammy’s anxiety grew unbearable and she was about to abandon her plan in order to preserve what affection Justin now showed her, Justin entered the room."
0,"He took one look at Sammy’s hunkered, almost crying frame with their blanket pulled close over her shoulders and closed the door."
0,"“Are you okay,” Justin asked as he sat down in front of her."
0,“Tyree said you have something important you want to talk with me about.”
0,Sammy’s mind fell in a state of panic.
0,In all her anxious waiting she had not thought of how to initiate the conversation.
0,"She could easily pass it off as nothing, and say that it was not that important anyway, but then again, Justin would never accept that after seeing her so troubled."
0,"Her mind spun in a tumult to think of anything to say, but nothing felt right."
0,All the while Justin sat patiently waiting for Sammy to speak first.
0,"In the end, she fell upon one question, unsure if it was the right one, but it was all she had."
0,"“When… when I broke up with you, I saw how much it hurt you."
0,Why didn’t you try to stop me?
0,You never tried to convince me to stay.
0,Not a single word.
0,You accepted it too quickly.
0,Why?”
0,Justin’s gaze lowered to the space between them.
0,"“So, this is it,” Justin’s expression was saying."
0,Sammy was opening old wounds that she was sure Justin wanted to forget.
0,"“It was because I loved you,” he answered."
0,Sammy’s breath caught.
0,"Her jaw quivered, but she managed to speak."
0,"“If you loved me, you should have stopped me."
0,I didn’t want to do it!
0,I thought there was something wrong with me that you didn’t like.
0,I thought you hated me after what I did that one night… 
0,"When you didn’t try to stop me, I thought you really did hate me.” "
0,Justin took a slow and deep breath.
0,"“I had given up on relationships before I met you, but you were so adamant about it that I decided to give myself one last chance, and I was ready to do everything I could to make it work."
0,"The more time I spent with you, the more I grew to love you."
0,"You are amazing, you know that?"
0,"You are strong-willed, intelligent, incredibly caring.”"
0,"Sammy listened intently, not wanting to miss a single syllable."
0,This was the first time Justin had ever opened up to her.
0,"Over their entire year of dating, he never talked about his feelings, and he rarely talked about himself."
0,"He showed how he felt through his actions and how he treated her, but that was all."
0,"“The more I realized my feelings, the more scared I became,” Justin continued."
0,“Scared?”
0,"“That night you mentioned, when you tried to urge me into sex, I was not mad at you."
0,I was angry at myself for not telling you the truth about me.
0,"I was too terrified to tell you, but I knew that if I didn’t, I would eventually give in to my feelings for you and hurt you.”"
0,Now Sammy was scared.
0,“What do you mean?”
0,“At the diner back in Gullivan you once asked about my past relationships.
0,My first time was when I was twelve.
0,She was fourteen.
0,"We were just some stupid kids experimenting with love, but immediately afterwards she got terribly sick."
0,"The truth came out, and a feud grew between our two families."
0,"My parents ended up having to help pay for her doctor’s visits, but as far as I know, she never recovered and remained bedridden most of her life."
0,“My second girlfriend was in high school.
0,"I was stupid then too, and just like before, she immediately grew ill."
0,"Worse, she also got pregnant."
0,My parents berated me because we went through the same ordeal all over again.
0,"She miscarried near the end of her first trimester, and two days later she passed away."
0,Her family found out that something similar happened with me before and they sued because they thought I slept with their daughter knowing this could happen.
0,"Medical professionals and researchers got involved to try to figure out why this was happening, but no one ever could."
0,I don’t have any known STDs.
0,I am sure there’s a medical journal or two written about me floating around somewhere.
0,I never brought you to meet my parents because I have been estranged from them after everything that has happened.”
0,Sammy now understood Justin’s aversion to sex.
0,He had some unknown disease that was potentially lethal.
0,"Sammy wanted to ask him why he never told her, that she could have been in danger, but she had to remind herself that she would not judge him no matter the truth she heard, although she never expected the truth to be something so severe."
0,"“When I got into college, I met another girl, and we started dating."
0,"I told her immediately that I wouldn’t have sex, and she was fine with that, but eventually she wanted to know why."
0,"When I told her, she broke up with me immediately and never spoke to me again."
0,"When I got to know another girl and we started talking about dating, I was up front about my condition."
0,"She not only broke all connection to me, she accused me of trying to kill her.”"
0,“That’s terrible!” 
0,“That happened the day before I met you.
0,Can you tell me honestly that you would not have done the same if I told you from the beginning?”
0,Sammy could not answer.
0,"Justin refrained from looking at her, but she could see the guilt eating away at him."
0,“I never meant to lead you on.
0,You positively glowed.
0,I could see that you loved me more than anyone ever had.
0,"I hoped that maybe, just maybe, you would be the one."
0,"When I walked out angry at myself for not telling you, for nearly putting you in that same danger, I decided then that I had to tell you the truth, and if you still loved me afterwards… "
0,I took extra jobs because I was saving for a ring.” 
0,"Tears flowed from Sammy’s eyes, and guilt twisted her stomach in knots."
0,You were… propose… 
0,Sammy mouthed the words her heart ached too much to ask.
0,"She loved Justin terribly, which was what made his reservation and silence near the end of their relationship so unbearable."
0,"While she was spiraling into depression from the unknown, he was agonizing over revealing what he feared was a relationship-ending secret."
0,"“I was going to tell you once I bought it, but when you broke up with me, I felt that choice was safer for you, so I let you go.”"
0,Sammy reached out a bare arm from under the blanket and grabbed Justin’s robe.
0,"She pulled herself, blanket and all, on top of him and knocked him back onto the mat."
0,"“You dumbass,” she screamed through tears with her arms wrapped around him."
0,"“I’m sorry, so sorry.” "
0,She could not judge him.
0,"She knew she could never understand what pain he had gone through after experiencing what he did, after accidently killing someone and then fearing that he might do the same to her."
0,Ceil was wrong.
0,Justin was not at fault.
0,No one was.
0,Justin embraced Sammy and rubbed her back while she cried.
0,“That’s why I can’t do this tonight or ever.
0,I don’t want to hurt you.”
0,Sammy stifled her cries.
0,Justin had realized her goal.
0,He possibly knew the moment he saw her bundled in a blanket.
0,She knew he was not so dense.
0,She looked into his warm and understanding gaze so full of love for her that it made her chest burn.
0,“We could ask Tyree.
0,We might at least be able to find out why it happens.”
0,"Justin’s expression darkened with guilt and some unspoken, hidden pain."
0,“I know why.
0,After it happened to… to Eydis… I realized it’s because of my toxic ven.
0,Ven transfers between partners through sex.
0,"I somehow have a resistance to it until it builds up and causes my migraines, but my ven overwhelms others and hurts them."
0,She couldn’t even use magic afterwards.”
0,Sammy sat back on Justin’s legs and covered her mouth in shock.
0,Eydis’s sickly appearance in the hospital was not from battle with a life mage as Justin had told her.
0,It was because of him.
0,"If she was unable to use magic, then she was unable to heal herself."
0,No wonder Justin felt so guilty over what happened and would never leave her bedside.
0,"He might have thought that it would be safe with someone who could use life magic, that Eydis was his last and only chance for a loving, intimate relationship."
0,"“Wasn’t she removing your toxic ven,” Sammy asked, still partially in denial over Justin’s explanation."
0,"“After she disappeared, we stopped, so it built up again.”"
0,"Sammy’s eyes widened, and her chest warmed."
0,There was a way.
0,“If there was someone else who could use life magic…” 
0,She got off of Justin and pulled him to sit up.
0,She took a deep breath and spoke with all seriousness.
0,“You have spent so long fearing you will hurt someone you love.
0,You can’t continue living like that.
0,I couldn’t bear seeing you suffer.
0,"I love you, more than anything in the world."
0,"I did when we were together, and I still do now… "
0,I love you even more than I did back then…” 
0,"“Sammy, we can’t,” Justin pleaded."
0,“I don’t want you to be controlled by fear anymore.
0,I can fix this.
0,I want you to trust me.
0,Can you?”
0,"Fear spread across Justin’s face, so Sammy slowly crawled over and brought her face close, placing her hand gently on his cheek as if consoling a child."
0,"“Trust me,” she said before kissing him."
0,"When their lips separated, she looked deeply and lovingly into the terror of his eyes."
0,"Their silent and still exchange continued, giving Justin all the time he needed to sort through his worries and fears."
0,Sammy waited.
0,No force.
0,No aggression.
0,Not a single word to urge his decision.
0,"The choice was his to make, and if he refused, she would continue loving him, even more than she ever had in the past, because more than anything, Justin was deserving of love."
0,Justin consented.
0,"He was shaking, so Sammy promised that she would envelope him in so much love that it would drown out his fears."
0,"She wanted him to enjoy this moment, and more importantly, she wanted him to feel free to enjoy many similar moments in the future, no longer imprisoned by his fears or past."
0,“Let me take care of everything.”
1,"* * *
Sammy awoke in the middle of the night in full body pain worse than the height of a terrible flu."
0,"She had never felt so ill in her entire life, and for a moment, a terrifying worry entered her mind."
0,What if this was permanent?
0,One girl never recovered.
0,Another died.
0,Eydis was unconscious and bedridden in the hospital unable to use life magic.
0,Sammy turned to look at Justin beside her.
0,He was sleeping peacefully.
0,She was doing this for him.
0,She told him to trust her.
0,She absolutely could not let him see her in this state.
0,"Little by little she slid out from under the blanket and crawled out of the room, lacking the strength to stand."
0,"Her muscles screamed with every motion, and she fought to suppress her cries."
0,"Once in front of Ceil’s door, she wondered if she even had the strength to reach up for the latch."
0,Coby hopped over the cold floor and pulled down the latch with his beak.
0,"He clamped his beak in worry, so Sammy thanked him and assured him that she would be fine."
0,"“Ceil, wake up. Please.”"
0, Sammy shook Ceil’s shoulders until her friend awoke with a start.
0,“Sammy?” Ceil pulled Sammy closer.
0,“You have a high fever.
0,What happened?”
0,"“Tyree, quickly.” "
0,Ceil rushed out of the room leaving Sammy sprawled out exhausted on her bed mat.
0,She returned in haste with Tyree leaning on her shoulder.
0,"“What happened,” Ceil asked again."
0,"“Ven poisoning,” Sammy replied."
0,“I hope.”
0,Tyree’s eyes narrowed.
0,“I should have known this would happen.
0,Sorry for not realizing it sooner.”
0,"“Someone please explain,” Ceil pleaded."
0,"“Justin produces toxic ven,” Tyree elaborated."
0,"“Ven levels equalize between partners during intercourse, and Justin has such abundance that Sammy, whose capacity is miniscule in comparison, would end up taking most of it."
0,"The surplus of healthy ven would disperse, but the toxic ven would remain, unable to escape.” "
0,She placed her hand on Sammy’s forehead.
0,“She has no healthy ven in her.
0,It is all toxic.”
0,"Hearing this, Sammy laughed."
0,"“What are you laughing for,” Ceil scolded, trying not to yell."
0,“This is a deadly condition.”
0,"“This is exactly what I was hoping would happen,” Sammy said."
0,“You wanted this?” 
0,Ceil could not have looked more dumbfounded.
0,“I wanted to show Justin that this is something that could be fixed.
0,"Tyree, can you remove it?”"
0,"“I can, but it will hurt,” Tyree warned."
0,“Can you numb me or knock me out first?
0,Eydis used to do that for Justin when she removed it daily.”
0,Tyree shook her head.
0,"“No, with how much stress your body is under, if I did that, your body could succumb and die."
0,It is far safer for you to stay conscious through the pain.
0,I can go slowly to make it less painful.
0,"Your capacity is low, so it should only take a moment.”"
0,Ceil grabbed her bind and wadded it up.
0,“Bite on this.”
0,Sammy did as instructed and mentally prepared.
0,"Tyree placed her hand on Sammy’s forehead, and all at once Sammy’s body was wracked with excruciating pain starting from her head and spreading throughout her extremities."
0,"She writhed, but Ceil held her fast."
0,"This is for Justin, she reminded herself."
0,Sammy spat out the wad of fabric.
0,"“Wait,” she cried silently with an agonized, high pitched squeal."
0,“Leave a little behind.”
0,"“You cannot be serious,” Ceil complained."
0,The pain slowly subsided followed by the onset of a deathly chill and then warmth.
0,"Sammy was sweating profusely, but the feeling of relaxation after such a traumatizing ordeal was heavenly and almost made Sammy laugh."
0,"“I left a little as requested and replaced your missing ven with mine,” Tyree explained"
0,“Why keep some?” Ceil demanded an answer.
0,“I’m going to investigate it during my meditation.
0,Maybe I will learn something that can help Justin.”
0,"“I agree with letting a little remain,” Tyree said."
0,"“When she learns to expel it on her own, she will not need a life mage to aid her should she choose to continue her relationship with Justin.”"
0,“That is absurd.” 
0,"Ceil sat back, bewildered by her friend’s commitment to such a troublesome man."
0,“Justin should be expelling his own first before you even consider doing this again.”
0,"“He can’t,” Sammy replied outright."
0,“He is unable to control his ven.
0,He can’t even feel it.
0,"Eydis was trying to teach him how to do it, but he’s never been successful."
0,She was always at a loss over what to do.
0,She always removed the toxic ven for him.”
0,"Ceil shook her head slowly, giving up."
0,"“For now, I will expel Justin’s toxic ven during his daily examinations."
0,"That should make sex safer for you for the time being,” Tyree said."
0,"“Speaking of safety,” Sammy said with a smile, finally feeling the satisfaction that should have immediately followed her evening with Justin, “can you use the contraceptive magic?”"
0,“I did promise.” 
0,"Ceil paced her hand over Sammy’s lower abdomen, and after a light prick internally that felt no different than being poked by a few needles, she finished."
0,"Sammy hugged both Ceil and Tyree, thanking them for their help and apologizing for waking them."
0,"She left Ceil’s room with Coby hopping close behind and entered her own room, pure elation bubbling within her."
0,"Unable to contain her excitement, she dove back onto the bed and crawled on top of Justin."
0,"He awoke with a weary gaze, and met Sammy’s smiling eyes."
0,“Sammy?”
0,Sammy kissed him passionately and then rested her cheek on his chest.
0,“See?
0,I told you everything would be okay.”
0,"Chapter 18
“Walking Forests”"
1,Salim walked away from the funeral pyre with weary steps.
0,"As captain of the guard, somehow the management of the refugee camp just beyond his gatehouse fell under his jurisdiction."
0,That also meant the disposal of the deceased from the camp was his duty.
0,"It was a miserable and thankless job, and he feared that the smell of burning flesh would never leave his nostrils."
0,"As the camp became less crowded, the deaths became less frequent, but there were still about ten a day."
0,His only solace was that he had others who stripped the corpses and prepared them for cremation.
0,He only needed to light the fires and observe them for ceremonial purposes until the corpses were consumed.
0,He dreaded the day when he would be required to pull a body mistaken for dead from the flames.
0,"A life mage was among those he assigned to prepare the dead, so it shouldn’t happen, but given the number of dead he burned each day, it was bound to happen at least once."
0,"His eyes followed the billowing smoke barely visible in the dark, cloudy night as he climbed the long stairway to the wall walk."
0,"He wanted to sleep, but his shift was not over and would not be over until midnight when his second in command would arrive to relieve him."
0,He could then hide away in the cramped guard house insulated by thick stone from the haunting noises of the refugee camp and hopefully sleep until sunrise.
1,The soldiers on the wall walk gazed at Salim with eyes just as weary as his.
0,All but a few were conscripted refugees with no more than a few days of combat training.
0,"At first, they were glad not to be stationed on the east wall staring down the enemy camp in the distance, but after the disastrous meeting of commanders, the south wall became the most dangerous station."
0,"Enemies hid among the trees, snipers employing wind magic to imbue their arrows with lethal power."
0,The arrows of wind archers ignored the breeze and were carried at many times the speed of normal arrows until the stored wind energy dissipated.
0,A skilled sniper could hit their target so long as there was a direct path.
0,The more skilled among them could even control the path of the arrow to hit targets around obstacles at the cost of some of the arrow’s penetrating power.
0,"Salim had two wind archers of his own on the south wall, but they could never see the enemy snipers through the forest canopy at night when the attacks usually occurred, whereas his soldiers were practically stationary targets atop the fire-lit walls."
0,"At least the fairies were able to hide behind the merlons built with small fairy stature in mind; however, this meant that the elves were often unable to fully conceal themselves, making them the common casualty of the enemy harassment."
0,Lord Olvor should have considered the other races when he ordered that the wall be elevated.
0,“It’s going to happen again.”
0,“It’s about the time.”
0,“Please not me…” 
0,The whispers of the soldiers Salim could hear as he passed showed the low state of the morale of the south wall.
0,"He heard that the enemy currently lacked the forces to assault the walls, but their psychological tactics were certainly effective."
0,“Commander!
0,Movement from the forest!” One of the Forest Elves under Salim’s command waved him over.
0,Their improved night vision made them indispensable spotters.
0,"“Just off the road before the bend,” the Forest Elf elaborated when Salim neared."
0,The other soldiers hunkered down with a few daring to peek from the embrasures.
0,“Too far for arrow fire… but a wind archer could still manage.
0,Can you hit them?”
0,“Perhaps.” 
0,"The Forest Elf drew his bow, and near invisible wind energy enveloped the arrow."
0,"“Hold your fire,” Salim ordered."
0,"Something fell out of the forest onto the roadside, or perhaps it was thrown out of the forest."
0,The Forest Elf lowered his bow when a figure walked out and grabbed the limp body.
0,"“That’s a Forest Elf,” he replied."
0,A second figure appeared on the road dragging another body.
0,The two Forest Elves were not armored.
0,They wore simple fur vests and knee-length trousers.
0,"They were hunters, but what purpose would hunters have to come to a city under siege?"
0,How did they sneak past the tight patrols of the scouting parties circling the city?
0,The eldest Forest Elf tossed the corpse of the human archer before the wall.
0,“My name is Debin.
0,We come from Melia with urgent news for your Thorn General.”
0,"“Lower the ropes,” Salim ordered. “Quickly!”"
1,"* * *
Dharin was awoken by the loud rapping of his bedroom door."
0,“Thorn General!”
0,He threw off his blanket and ran to the soldier.
0,“Is it an attack?” 
0,One by one his guests peaked out of their rooms with worry spread across their faces.
0,"“No, sir."
0,An emergency council has been called to session by the Captain of the Guard.
0,A messenger from Melia has arrived with grave news.”
0,“Inform Salim I will be there immediately.” 
0,“Yes sir.” 
0,The soldier saluted and ran down the spiral staircase.
0,"“Ceil, will you join us,” Dharin asked."
0,“Certainly.” Ceil disappeared back into her room to prepare.
0,Dharin threw on his robe and looped his long ponytail behind his head.
0,Kiri was ready just after him with Ceil following close behind.
0,"“Should we come too,” Sammy asked."
0,"“We alone are fine,” Ceil answered for Dharin."
0,“I will inform you afterwards.”
1,Dharin rushed out of the manor and to the temple a tier higher in the middle of the central district.
0,Several council members and nobles were slowly filtering in through the corridor to the inner sanctum.
0,"Behind the table stood Salim and two Forest Elves, one elderly and the second much younger and with heavy burn scars covering his chest and arms."
0,"“I know them,” Ceil said to Dharin as they neared the inner sanctum."
0,“They live in the central Melian village where the hamadryad resides.
0,They saved Chloe from Captain Byurk’s soldiers.
0,Their message should be trusted.”
0,"“Understood,” Dharin replied."
0,The two Forest Elves noticed Ceil and bowed deeply.
0,She took her seat and raised her hand to signal that they could relax.
0,"Once the remaining council members wandered in, some with far less urgency than Dharin would have expected for a city under siege, the emergency meeting began, and Salim stood to address the council."
0,“I called this meeting to discuss the message brought to us by Debin and Benab.
0,They originally fled Vallen ahead of the campaign but returned to us from Melia bearing ominous news.
0,"The hamadryad who supported Empress Ceil and controlled northern Dhuillir is dead, and a large army from Amel is approaching.”"
0,Dharin heard a small gasp from Ceil’s seat beside him.
0,"Indeed, this was terrible news."
0,"Frantic whispers grew from around the table, and Dharin raised his hand to silence them."
0,"“Debin, your full report, please,” he said."
0,Salim stepped back to let Debin take his place.
0,“We received word that an army from Amel was marching through Dhuillir conscripting dryads not loyal to the hamadryad.
0,The hamadryad ordered all who were able to gather in Melia to stop the rapidly growing army from passing into Vallen.
0,This included the three warrior tribes.
0,"About eleven days ago, the hamadryad’s army did battle against the forces of Tolmyur, and victory was assured, but we learned the kissiae had left the protection of Elos to meet with the hamadryad."
0,"When the kissiae matriarch could not convince the hamadryad to change sides against our Empress and her companions, she used the connection of the hamadryad to incapacitate all dryads under her influence, slowly killing the hamadryad in the process."
0,The forces of Tolmyur eliminated our army.
0,"The kissiae have joined Tolmyur, bringing along every able-bodied dryad they passed on their way from Elos to Melia.”"
0,"“This is absurd,” one council member spoke, and even Dharin felt that such a chain of events was hard to believe."
0,The kissiae never left Elos because they had spent the past thousands of years in isolation trying to regrow their population from the brink of extinction.
0,"Dharin already informed the council of the kissiae’s involvement that Ceil had learned from a sprite, but without any other evidence than the sprite’s word, there were few on the council who believed."
0,"Also, the thought that a regular dryad, even a kissiae, could overpower a hamadryad was just as absurd."
0,"“I can add validity to Debin’s story,” Ceil said, silencing the whispers of the counsel."
0,"“Eleven days matches the time one of my companions, a Melian under the hamadryad’s influence, was caught with a terrible disease that left her bedridden for two days.”"
0,“What of the Melians working our grounds?” one of the council asked.
0,“They came from a new village that had not learned of the hamadryad’s existence and so were not under her influence.
0,Lemi was the only one affected.”
0,"“Our Empress informed me that she knew these two Forrest Elves from Melia and that we should trust any news they carry,” Dharin explained in an attempt to satisfy the doubting eyes of the council."
0,“How large is the approaching army?”
0,"“Of Tolmyur, possibly 40 or 50 thousand."
0,"Of the dryads, too many to estimate, many times more than the population of your city, refugees included,” Benab announced."
0,“They are making use of their dryads to move Tolmyur’s army quickly.
0,It was all we could do to stay ahead of them.
0,"They will arrive on the morrow, by morning if not sooner.”"
0,The entire room fell silent.
0,"The minimum ratio of soldiers required to assault a fortified city was about two to one, but that was expecting heavy casualties on the attacking side."
0,"If this army was as large as he said, they would far surpass those numbers."
0,The enemy had more than enough power to overtake the city.
0,"The question then became what the kissiae, the strongest of all the dryads, would add to the battle."
0,"“If I may be so bold,” Benab spoke up, catching the attention of the council."
0,“This is not a fight you can win.
0,"There is little that can be done for your city, so I beg that you send Empress Ceil and her companions out of the city."
0,We can take them safely past the enemy patrols.”
0,“I refuse!” Ceil stood from her chair.
0,Her sudden refusal silenced the angry shouts that were about to erupt from the council.
0,“You witnessed the power of Chloe in Melia.
0,"If you were here eight days ago, you would have witnessed an even grander display."
0,She alone could eliminate a hundred thousand dryads.
0,We can still survive this battle.”
0,"Dharin’s heart sank when hearing his granddaughter speak of the destruction of her own former subjects, but this was war, and with the loss of the hamadryad, the dryads were now their enemy."
0,"The fairies were truly alone in their struggle, and should they survive this battle, Ceil would have to rebuild her empire anew."
0,“You will not flee?” Debin asked with mournful eyes.
0,“No.
0,"I will weather this storm with the fairies,” Ceil asserted."
0,The council exchanged expressions of awe.
0,Those who once berated Ceil and doubted her commitment to the war now glowed with praise for their empress.
0,“Long live Empress Ceil!”
0,“Praised be our Empress!” 
0,Ceil watched the admiration in shock.
0,Dharin knew of her commitment and the pain that Ceil felt choosing against all ridicule to support a city whose leaders did not trust her.
0,This was the first great milestone in the creation of her new empire.
0,"“Have you all gone mad,” Benab protested, but Debin placed his hand on his shoulder to silence him."
0,Benab brushed it off and spoke after a deep breath.
0,“I have stood with Lady Chloe on the shores of Ithsa.
0,"If you are to send her to fight an army on her own, I will protect her with my life.”"
0,"Ithsa, the river of death in ancient Forest Elf religion--Dharin understood his meaning."
0,"Those who stood on its shores together, who have tasted death together and survived, are soul-bound."
0,Benab will not leave Chloe’s side after such a declaration.
0,"“She will not be alone, and thank you for your help.” "
0,"Ceil looked to Debin, and there was an unspoken conversation between their gazes, one of remorse and apology."
0,"“We must hasten our preparations,” Dharin said."
0,“We are already far behind schedule.
0,The great battle may be upon us sooner than we think.”
1,"* * *
Byurk stood in attention at the border of his camp as the support army from Amel arrived."
0,"Those behind General Bregon were not humans, although at first appearance one might mistake them as such."
0,"They were naiads, and upon the shoulders of some rode dryads no larger than he with long ivy hair that fell to the ground."
0,"Byurk worried about General Bregon’s order to give full command to the kissiae, that the order might have been made through a kissiae’s infamous domination, but no kissiae clung to General Bregon that he could see."
0,"A massive army of dryads appeared from the forests behind the naiads, outnumbering his army many to one."
0,"Convincing such a large concourse of dryads who despised Tolmyur to join them in battle against former citizens of their empire and their empress should have been impossible, but the words of the hamadryad echoed in Byurk’s mind."
0,"Age was authority in dryad tradition, and legends told of a kissiae older than the Amelian Empire."
0,"If she preached their traditional customs now that the empire had fallen, the dryads would obey."
0,"As the army neared, Byurk found the eldest of the kissiae sitting atop the naiad closest to General Bregon."
0,"The longer he looked upon her, the more pressure he felt by her presence."
0,There was no doubt in his mind.
0,She was a kissiae that predated the Amelian Empire’s fifty-thousand-year reign.
0,Byurk almost knelt out of reflex but managed a salute as General Bregon approached.
0,"“General Bregon, thank you for heeding my request for aid."
0,You could not have come at a better time.”
0,"“Captain Byurk, by your wisdom and planning in effort to preserve our hold in Amel and eliminate the widow of the emperor and her otherworld companions, you are hereby promoted to general, ratified by six of the eight generals stationed in Amel under our Commanding General Jethro.” "
0,"Byurk bowed, surprised by the sudden promotion."
0,"He felt that ever since he encountered the widow, he had made one mistake after another."
0,“I am humbled and graciously accept.”
0,"“General Byurk,” the kissiae matriarch spoke, causing the hairs on the back of Byurk’s neck to rise, “You and your soldiers will obey my orders in this battle."
0,"I promise that most of your men will survive, but first, I must know all you know.”"
0,The naiad approached and set the kissiae matriarch on the ground before Byurk.
0,"His nerves told him to flee, but he was unable to move away from her overpowering presence."
0,"She placed her hand on his forehead, and all his memories from the beginning of the Vallen campaign flooded his mind at impossible speeds."
0,He was left mentally exhausted and barely able to stand when she stepped back from him.
0,"“I rescind my promise, General Byurk."
0,We may indeed have an arduous battle ahead of us.”
0,"“Is the city that powerful,” General Bregon asked."
0,"“Not the city or the elf-kin but those we are after, the trespassers you have led to this world.”"
0,"“My plan was to weaken the city through starvation and harassment,” Byurk explained."
0,"“Even if they are powerful, their minds and bodies are still human."
0,Our chance of success will be far greater.”
0,“No.
0,The sprites have sided with the trespassers.
0,"Should the situation grow dire, they may come to their aid."
0,"No number of soldiers we bring could ever defeat them, and the only kissiae who could stand against them is not present."
0,"Even if the sprites do not aid them, the longer we wait, the higher the possibility they may escape."
0,I will make preparations immediately.
0,Our attack will begin when finished.”

Salim trudged through the refugee camp with heavy steps."
0,"The meeting he called dragged on into the early morning, and because he had called it to session, he was not allowed to leave until it finished."
0,They spent much of the time trying to plan countermeasures against the kissiae and the large army of dryads following them.
0,"This led to an even longer discussion on how to best supply Lady Chloe with enough ven, prevent her from overheating, replenish the nutrients required for fire ven conversion, and protect her against an inevitable enemy counterattack because she would surely draw aggression immediately."
0,"She was their most powerful weapon, and it was no stretch to say that if she fell quickly, so would the city."
0,"The sun would rise in a few hours, so Salim hoped that his replacement would agree to cover for him longer so that he could sleep through the morning."
0,Night or day made no difference in the windowless guardhouse.
0,"He only needed some quiet, but that did not appear to be possible."
0,"The soldiers atop the wall were all awake and in a panic, immediately removing any hope Salim had of sleep."
0,He dashed up the steps to see the source of the commotion.
0,A low rumble vibrated through the stone and slowly grew louder.
0,"An attack was the first thought on Salim’s mind, but what he saw from atop the wall was bewildering."
0,"If it was an attack, it was not one of soldiers but of trees."
0,"The forests in the distance gathered and approached, walking on their roots and collecting the trees in their path."
0,The mass of foliage grew larger and larger until it met the walls and bent around the city as if trying to absorb it.
0,The enemy had numerous dryads at their command.
0,They had the kissiae.
0,None of the soldiers on the wall had been informed about this yet.
0,This was an attack.
0,“To arms!
0,Sound the alarm!”
0,Horns blared across Revlan waking the city from its troubled sleep.
0,Red flares rose into the sky.
0,"Soldiers gathered beyond capacity atop the outer and inner walls, and the refugees in the camp were evacuated to the inner city by weapon-point."
0,"“Fire mages, burn the trees at first sign of enemy movement!”"
0,"As the fires atop the walls grew larger for better visibility in the dark, Salim saw the northern forest engulfing the city to meet the south."
0,"Revlan was surrounded, and the thickness of the forests continued to grow around the city until no one could see where the forests ended in the dark."
0,"Only the pyres of the enemy camp to the east remained visible, unchanging, as if it had no part in the amassing forests."
0,All at once the world grew still.
0,Every soldier watched the dark with bated breath fearing when the attack would begin.
0,The canopy of the trees was so full that when looking down from the wall they stood upon they could not see the ground.
0,"The night was far too silent, and no one dared make any noise for fear of drowning out the sound of approaching boots or clanking weapons and armor."
0,"“Something’s there,” a Forest Elf said as she stared into the dense canopy."
0,A winged fairy flew overhead and circled the forest.
0,"A long spear many times his height was in hand, and he swiped at the canopy as he passed to catch glimpse of what hid underneath."
0,He immediately flew back to the walls.
0,“Dryads!”
0,The silent killers.
0,"“Burn the trees!” Salim called, but those who heard him hesitated."
0,“The dryads have sided with Tolmyur!
0,Burn the trees!”
0,"Before the first fireball could be thrown, the trees nearest the walls bent and contorted with the sound of snapping wood."
0,Their branches grew rapidly toward the wall and clung to the stone until they climbed high enough to reach the walk.
0,The trees behind clung to those before until the thickening branches weaved into a ramp from below the canopy across every stretch of the wall walk.
0,"These were war ladders, and there were far too many to remove."
0,“Burn them!” Salim screamed as the first silent killers ran up the branches from below the canopy.
0,"Chapter 19
“The Kissiae’s Targets”"
1,"“Lady Ceil, hurry."
0,"We must take you to the inner sanctum,” Kiri called from the doorway of the manor."
0,“They will not reach the curtain wall so quickly.” 
0,Ceil raised her arms to adjust the slack of her armor while Justin laced up the back so that the jack would not be too tight.
0,Thanysa relinquished the duty of Ceil’s armor to him because it was far easier to fasten.
0,Meanwhile Thanysa was busy attaching the many pieces of Justin’s leather armor to his arms and legs.
0,"When finished, Kiri passed Justin his shield and led them down the manor walkway in a slow jog so Justin could keep pace."
1,They met Sammy and Chloe on the road surrounded by several soldiers and the two familiar Forest Elves.
0,"“Please help protect the orphanage while I’m gone,” Chloe asked."
0,"“I will,” Sammy replied."
0,"“I hope you are not sending her to the outer wall,” Ceil said to Dharin."
0,"Chloe’s position discussed in the meeting was on the east wall facing the enemy camp where she could preemptively attack any approaching enemies, but now that the attack had already begun, placing her on the outer wall was too dangerous."
0,"“She will be atop a tower on the inner wall on the southeast side,” Dharin explained."
0,“The dryads are already attacking the outer wall in force all around the city.
0,We are holding them back for now.
0,"Chloe should be able to attack over the outer wall from there, and any who make it past into the refugee camp will become open targets for her.”"
0,Ceil eyed the large guard assigned to Chloe.
0,There were four winged fairies tasked with areal cover and evacuation should the wall be overrun.
0,"Two High Elves were provided both for life magic and to transfer ven to her from her other guards, a number of fairies and elves whose ven capacities were quite high."
0,Each of them was also a water mage tasked with preventing Chloe from overheating.
0,"Debin was a wind archer, so he and his son were tasked with taking out any enemies who could potentially attack Chloe from a distance."
0,"Lastly, a single Mountain Elf even larger than Sarodyn and nearly as tall as the High Elves was selected for his skill in reinforcement magic."
0,He was adorned in plate armor to be Chloe’s shield.
0,"The guard, far more powerful than what Ceil was ever provided, may have looked excessive, but Ceil knew that the city’s survival very much depended on Chloe’s magic."
0,"“Remember Chloe, no massive attacks like before."
0,You will deal more damage with multiple smaller attacks.
0,Even your smaller attacks should be far more powerful than anything we or they could manage.” 
0,Ceil reminded Chloe of Dharin’s advice after the meeting of commanders.
0,"In large scale war, reserving one’s ven was vital for survival."
0,"The moment one’s ven depleted, they would weaken and become easily killed."
0,Most magic used in large battles was weaker and used very little ven for this reason.
0,"Chloe nodded, and Ceil reached over to hug her friend."
0,“Be safe.
0,"Come back alive,” Ceil said."
0,"“I will,” Chloe replied, rubbing Ceil’s back."
0,"Despite Chloe’s assurance, Ceil was still worried."
0,Both times Chloe fought against enemy soldiers she had been injured.
0,Sammy hugged Ceil next.
0,"“If something happens to me, take care of Justin for me."
0,Please?”
0,Ceil sighed.
0,"“If Tolmyur succeeds in breaching all the way to the central district with enough forces to place you in danger, we are all dead anyway, including him.”"
0,"“We must hurry,” Kiri said again, urging everyone to move to their assigned tasks."
1,"Dharin flew off to command his soldiers, and Sammy and Lemi ran for Lord Olvor’s manor."
0,"Ceil followed Kiri up the steps to the temple grounds, pausing momentarily to watch Chloe and her guard run out the gate in the distance."
0,The entrances to the temple grounds were defended by royal guards as if advertising Ceil’s presence.
0,It was the center of the city behind another wall and portcullis that was now closing.
0,There were three steep stairways to the grounds that could be easily defended.
0,The temple itself was a sturdy stone structure that had survived from the ancient civilization and would not likely be destroyed from an attack.
0,The doors to the inner sanctum were crafted from thick and heavy wood and could be barred by four large beams on the inside.
0,The corridor past the door was long and would be difficult to assault if the soldiers holed themselves in.
0,"In the fortress city of Revlan, the temple was a fortress all its own."
1,Ceil sat in the back of the sanctum next to Justin who stood with shield at the ready.
0,Kiri was also present sending and receiving messages through the single overworked spatial pixie.
0,"The large council table was divided into its sections to be used as a barricade in the corridor, and no less than thirty elite soldiers stood with weapons drawn behind it."
0,The thick stone walls insulated the sanctuary from any noise outside.
0,Even the small sun holes were crafted with such acoustics that sound was muffled and could not reach the sanctum.
0,"This was a room for prayer, meditation, and silence, but that also meant that Ceil had no way to know how the battle was progressing."
0,"The messages being passed to Kiri were often written, and anything spoken was brief or in military code that Ceil did not understand."
0,"“I hate not knowing what is happening,” she mumbled in English."
0,Justin turned to her with an assuring face shaded under the lip of his cowl.
0,She had not spoken in English to be comforted by him or to strike a conversation.
0,"In all honesty, she was still uncomfortable being next to him."
0,"Her resentment for him had not fully abated even though she knew it was unwarranted, especially after Justin saved her, but the silence was choking her nerves and drawing out her anxiety."
0,"The soldiers would make terrible conversation partners, and Kiri was busy, so Justin was all she had, but what could she talk about?"
0,"Thinking topics over in the suffocating silence, there was something that she wanted to vent now that the fighting had begun."
0,“I want you to know that I am very angry at you and Sammy.”
0,“Angry?” Justin was taken aback by the sudden statement.
0,"“Was it because of, well…”"
0,"“No. What you two choose to do together in private is none of my concern, and I am more than happy to help Sammy."
0,My anger lies elsewhere.
0,You and Sammy should have fled when I told you to.
0,You have no reason to be caught up in this battle.”
0,Justin smiled and shook his head.
0,“We do have a reason.
0,"Sammy sees you as a friend, and though you don’t seem to like me much, I do as well."
0,"You were very dear to Eydis, so of course we would stay and help."
0,"I was already able to help you once, so I’m glad I stayed.”"
0,Ceil glanced around at Kiri and the other soldiers.
0,"She was speaking in English, so none of them could understand, but she was still worried one of them might, no matter how unlikely it would be."
0,"“I am grateful to you for saving me, but I want you to promise me something.” "
0,She turned to look into Justin’s eyes.
0,"This was the first time she had ever done so, so Justin immediately caught on to the seriousness of her request."
0,“If it is something I can do.”
0,“Good.
0,"If the temple is breached and you must make the choice to save me or save yourself, I want you to save yourself.”"
0,Justin sighed.
0,“You know I can’t make that promise.”
0,His light dismissal of her earnest request twisted a knot in Ceil’s chest.
0,Anger welled within her that she could not keep from overflowing.
0,She pushed aside his shield and grabbed the front of his hardened leather armor.
0,“Do you have any idea why Sammy chose you to protect me?”
0,Justin grew nervous from the startled glances of the soldiers who watched their empress grow angry at the man charged with her protection.
0,"He tried to motion Ceil to calm down, but she wouldn’t have it."
0,“Answer me.”
0,“Because I can’t do much else with my time magic.” 
0,"Ceil released Justin, completely flabbergasted by his lack of understanding."
0,“Look at where you are standing.
0,"Look at the walls, the barricade, the soldiers, and the door."
0,Anywhere they would put me during the attack would be the safest place in the entire city.
0,Sammy charged you with my protection so that you would be safe!
0,I have no one waiting for me to return to them.
0,My death will be no major loss for anyone.
0,"You have both Eydis and Sammy, two women with whom you can build a future together."
0,"I do not know the full extent of your relationship with Eydis, but I do know how much Sammy loves you."
0,You never saw what anguish she endured fearing your death every day.
0,She would be devastated if anything happened to you.
0,"She may mourn my death for a time, but she would never recover from yours."
0,"If you must choose between saving my life and saving yours, I order you to abandon me.”"
0,Justin frowned. 
0,“No. Sammy and Eydis would never forgive me if I left you to die.
0,"If you want to give an order, you can."
0,You are the empress.
0,The soldiers here will listen to anything you say.
0,"If you want me to abandon you, order them to remove me from the temple."
0,"If you can’t, I will stay and protect you.”"
0,Justin’s refusal after all that Ceil said to help him understand how much he had to lose infuriated her.
0,"She wanted to order the soldiers to remove him, but she couldn’t."
0,The doors were barred and would not be opened.
0,"If she expressed any distrust in Justin or his ability to protect her, her order would only serve to have him moved to the forward barricade or bound, and in the event of an attack, his life would be in even greater danger."
0,"Ceil swallowed her anger and relinquished herself to his protection, promising in silence that she would never stop hating him."
1,"* * *
The broad-shouldered Mountain Elf led Chloe up the spiral stairway inside one of the inner wall’s towers."
0,"In the circular room at the top of the steps, the exit to the wall walk was so crowded with frantic soldiers they were nearly falling into the stairwell."
0,"A cacophony of shouts and cries echoed across the stone, and Chloe thought that the enemy had made it to the inner wall, but the armored Mountain Elf pushing the much smaller fairies aside did not appear to be preparing for combat."
0,The walls were simply that crowded.
0,Chloe followed close to his back so that she would not get separated from the important gap in the crowd he created with each assertive step.
0,"The rest of her guard followed close behind, preventing the gap from closing."
0,"“Where… um…Where stop,” Chloe asked loudly in broken Elven to be heard over the noise of the soldiers and combat that was not yet visible."
0,The Mountain Elf pointed upwards.
0,"In the back of the small room of the tower, a lone ladder rose through an opening in the ceiling."
0,The legs of soldiers were visible in the flickering glow of the firelight atop the tower belvedere.
0,Chloe’s heart raced as the grip of fear repeatedly squeezed it in rapid succession.
0,She was sure she could manage standing atop the walls.
0,"They were tall but not too tall, only about fifty feet, and there was a lip that would prevent her from falling."
0,Standing atop the tower was different.
0,"It was smaller, and there was a drop on every side."
0,The only exit was a hole down a twenty-foot drop.
0,The Mountain Elf swiftly climbed the creaking wooden ladder in his heavy plate armor and waived his hand to urge Chloe to follow.
0,Chloe grabbed the rungs of the ladder and quickly scaled it with her eyes shut tight.
0,"She did not know how close she was to the top, but she feared to open them until she could feel the stone floor beneath her feet."
0,"Near to the top, large hands grabbed both her arms and lifted her through the opening to set her on solid ground."
1,A swift pat on her back forced her eyes open.
0,"The belvedere looked like a stone gazebo with tall, pointed archways facing each of the eight cardinal directions."
0,A conical wood-lined roof sat atop the archways with even smaller arched windows.
0,"A thin walkway circled the base of the ceiling where fairy archers knelt, firing arrows out the windows into the night."
0,Debin and Benab jumped up to grab hold of the walkway and swung up and out of the belvedere to stand above the windows on the roof for a less obstructed view.
0,"Chloe feared for a moment that she would be placed up there in an even taller, far more precarious location, but the Mountain Elf nudged her forward to the east-facing archway."
0,"The belvedere was far less crowded than the walls, and only archers and mages stood atop it."
0,Packing them in would benefit little if they could not be near the edge to fire upon the enemy.
0,"The fairies quickly made room for Chloe after seeing who had approached behind them, but Chloe desperately wished they were still in front of her."
0,"There was no low wall, no railing, nothing to prevent her from falling nearly eighty feet to her death."
0,"In a moment of panic, she lunged to the side and clung to the nearest stone pillar supporting the roof."
0,“I can’t do this.
0,"I can’t do it,” Chloe cried."
0,She felt terribly ashamed.
0,The thought of being personally involved in the battle and taking many lives did not scare her as much as this.
0,"The battle should be far more harrowing, but what broke her spirit was her fear of heights."
0,She hated it.
0,She knew that this fear was unfounded.
0,There was no reason to be so terrified.
0,"She knew it and tried to convince herself of it, but her mind and body reacted on its own by pure fearful instinct."
0,"“I’m sorry,” Chloe said in Elven, unable to open her eyes."
0,A large hand rested gently on her shoulder.
0,"“We are all scared,” the Mountain Elf replied in a soft tone, “but there is something we fear more, the loss of our loved ones in the city.”"
0,"“Look,” spoke a female voice from the direction Chloe knew was the open air."
0,"Her eyes resisted, but she managed to peel them open long enough to see a woman floating in the air on translucent feathered wings that almost glowed in the night."
0,The fairy looked like an angel.
0,“We will protect you.”
0,"The words of encouragement Chloe knew were being spoken for her benefit fell upon ears that could not understand them, but what Chloe realized after seeing the angelic fairy was that these guards would not let her fall."
0,"She quite literally had guardian angels looking out for her, and that thought lit a faint spark of courage in her."
0,The fairy noticed the small spark in Chloe’s eyes and flew upwards.
1,Chloe’s world that had been restricted to the top of the tower because she so desperately wanted to ignore the heights outside the gazebo-like room now extended into the open air.
0,She saw the ongoing struggle atop the outer wall no more than twenty yards away and the immense forest beyond that had not existed before in her memory.
0,Each soldier raised a spear over the head of the one before them.
0,"Fairies stood in the front near the crenellations, and the taller elves stood behind nearly leaning over the fairies."
0,Dryads climbed up every foot of wall in great numbers--most were weaponless or carried spears of their own--and impaled themselves on the fairies’ spears.
0,"Chloe watched as each dryad was slowly torn apart by numerous and repeated punctures, and yet they still reached forward to kill with their touch."
0,Some of the dryads grew branches and roots from their spears to ensnare and kill the fairies blocking their entrance into the wall.
0,"Those became immediate targets for fire magic, but they often could not be killed in time to spare the victims of the dryad’s deadly touch."
0,"If not for the reach of the spears preventing most the dryads from coming close, the entire wall would have been overrun."
0,"For every two or three mutilated or burning dryads that were flung overhead by the tips of the elves’ spears into the space between the walls, a fairy or elf fell to a dryad’s magic, spear, or arrow."
0,"Like the dead dryads, the deceased among the soldiers were shifted back to be pushed unceremoniously down into the space between the walls to make room for more soldiers at the front."
0,"In all the frantic carnage, Chloe could not see where she would be able to use her fire magic to help them."
0,"The forest canopy glowed faintly from the fires lit atop the walls, but she could not see from what direction the dryads came."
0,"A few of the trees were already burning, but that did not stop the dryads from climbing up the sloping branches to the wall."
0,"Dharin and Ceil ordered her to use small fireballs strategically, but a little fire would never stop them."
0,"With one arm wrapped around the stone, she conjured a fireball that dripped with viscous heat."
0,Her body trembled from the fear that throwing it would make her lose her balance and fall.
0,"Her breaths grew short as her arm reached back, and with a scream, she flung her hand forward and loosed the ball."
0,It spat flames to propel it through the air safely over the soldiers’ desperate struggle on the outer wall and landed in the canopy another fifty yards past.
0,"The explosion sent a glowing plume of fire into the air, almost blinding in the dark."
0,"The heat washed over everyone atop the wall and even reached Chloe on her tower, feeling like a strong breeze."
0,"Amid the cries of battle, Chloe heard shouts of praise and excitement."
0,Their ultimate weapon had arrived to repel the seemingly endless wave of dryads.
0,Chloe lit a second fireball and threw it near the first.
0,The third she threw just beside the second.
0,Each fireball and resulting explosion created a line of fire that began to ebb the wave of dryads approaching from that direction.
0,The few who made it through were either on fire or heavily burnt and too weak to assault those defending the wall.
0,"After the fourth, Chloe felt the cold shivers of exhaustion."
0,"She could only manage two of her largest before depleting her ven, and although she decreased the size, she could only create four of these fireballs, each one similar in destructive power to the one she used in the central Melian village."
0,A cold breeze enveloped Chloe’s radiating body from a fairy releasing frost from his hands.
0,She had not even realized that she was growing too hot to touch.
0,"When her body temperature dropped, a High Elf placed his hand on her arm wrapped around the stone."
0,Clasped in his other hand was the arm of a different fairy.
0,"Chloe felt warmth enter her arm and spread throughout her body, ending her shivers as her body filled with ven."
0,A confident smile grew on Chloe’s face.
0,She could do this.
0,She lit another fireball and continued lengthening her wall of fire.

“That is Chloe Hearn, third tower from the south.” Byurk’s words to the kissiae matriarch were relayed directly to one of the five kissiae hiding deep in the forest on the south side of the city."
0,"“We located a trespasser,” she informed the awaiting naiads and Tolmyur soldiers."
0,The 44 kissiae were divided into ten groups and placed at the edge of the forest around the city.
0,The naiads who guarded them were likewise distributed as were the Tolmyur soldiers.
0,"The goal of the dryad assault was not to overtake the outer wall, although if they could the battle would progress much quicker."
0,"Using dryads as the sole initial attackers drew out the city’s most powerful fire mage, one of the kissiae’s targets."
0,"The naiads led the march through the dense forest, parting the dryads fearfully awaiting their turn to throw themselves at the enemies atop the walls."
0,"The nearest entrance was the main gatehouse blocked by a thick, metal-reinforced portcullis."
0,"Trees were initially moved in front of the portcullis close enough for their trunks to touch to prevent those who may be in the tunnel from seeing the approaching dryads, but now the tree barrier served no purpose."
0,The kissiae placed her small hand on one of the trunks.
0,Branches grew out from the tightly packed barrier of trees and wrapped around the beams of the portcullis.
0,"With one swift motion, the entire portcullis was ripped from the walls as if pulling a weed up from its roots, sending a shower of rock and stone from the broken wall."
0,"The branches raised the portcullis above the entrance to the tunnel, and the trunks of the trees parted."
0,The terrified soldiers guarding the gatehouse tunnel watched naiads enter from between the trees with glimmering silver swords brandished in front of them.
0,"Magic of fire, ice, wind, and stone flew at them, but the practiced arms of the naiads dispersed the magic before it could harm the archers following behind."
0,A barrage of arrows flooded the cramped tunnel without giving the soldiers anywhere to flee but back toward the city.
0,A fairy earth mage erected a wall to block passage.
0,"Two dwarves charged through, pressing against the wall and forcing it back with their own earth magic."
0,"Several earth mages joined them quickly, and the barrier that the enemy foolishly erected in fear became a protection for safe passage through the tunnel."
0,A thin string appeared from the wall of the tunnel and snagged the neck of one of the human earth mages.
0,"Strong and woven from hair, it was sharp and slowly cut through the flesh of his neck."
0,“Oreads!”
0,The soldiers focused their attention on the sides of the tunnel and stopped moving the wall.
0,"One of the dwarves placed his hand on the stone near the ensnared soldier, and after scanning it with earth magic, he struck it with his fist."
0,"A horizontal fissure grew, and the soldier was released immediately."
0,"Although nymphs could meld with their elements, their bodies were still present."
0,Oreads could be killed if the stone that held their bodies was severed so that one vital section of their body was completely separated from the other.
0,"“She moved in time,” the dwarf announced."
0,“The split wasn’t perfect.”
0,"“Keep moving,” the kissiae ordered."
0,The earth mages continued pushing the wall through the tunnel while the other soldiers and naiads watched the stone.
0,"Another cord appeared, but a swift-handed giant grabbed it before it could snag a minum."
0,"He tugged with his superior strength, and the hands that held the cord were severed immediately by a naiad’s blade the moment they appeared from the wall."
0,The oread cried in pain and retracted into the stone.
0,She could no longer harm them.
0,"None attacked after the first oread was neutralized, but the soldiers kept watch."
0,Perhaps there was only one oread present at this entrance.
1,"“Ready,” one of the dwarves called once the wall reached the end of the tunnel."
0,"With a signal from the kissiae, the earth mages struck the wall, blowing it out as shrapnel into the courtyard."
0,"Magic and arrows rained on the exit, but the dwarves and giants were ready with their shields and the naiads with their resfahil blades."
0,They flooded out into the courtyard trampling the Revlan soldiers caught in the rubble.
0,The soldiers in the courtyard were in disarray.
0,There was no rank or order to them.
0,“Conscripts!
0,Take them out!”
0,"“The naiads will handle the courtyard,” the kissiae called."
0,“You soldiers take the walls.”
0,"Most of the enemy on the wall walk was preoccupied trying to hold back the never-ending dryad onslaught, but there were a few who turned back to fire magic and arrows into the courtyard."
0,"The giants led the assault up the steps, kicking aside and trampling the fairies who only stood as high as their thighs."
0,"Their shields and plate armor repelled most spears and arrows, but even then, there was too little resistance."
0,The soldiers in the courtyard were not the only amateurs.
0,Many of those atop the wall were untrained as well.
0,One of the giants took an arrow through the helmet from a wind archer and fell back atop his fellow soldiers.
0,"All they needed was to clear one section of wall, but a second well-placed arrow killed another giant."
0,"“Target the wind bowman,” a minum screamed, and their archers fired a volley of arrows in the direction of the attack, not knowing from where the arrows came."
0,The cover fire stalled long enough for one last giant and three dwarves to reach the top of the steps.
0,"One of the dwarves, a fire mage, imbued his hammer with flame, spreading glowing cracks through the metal."
0,Each strike exploded with sparks and metal shrapnel.
0,The giant threw every fairy and elf he could off the back of the wall onto his soldiers waiting below.
0,The remaining two dwarves impaled the enemy with stone spikes raised from the wall walk below their feet.
0,The resistance was breached.
0,Dryads now flooded over the wall and into the courtyard.
0,"“Hurry and get us to the inner wall before the trespasser notices the dryads got in,” the kissiae ordered."
0,She and the other four kissiae jumped off their naiads’ shoulders and sprinted on all fours weaving through the enemy soldiers while the naiads killed those who tried to attack them to act as a distraction away from the small green bodies.
0,"The reach of the spears were nothing against the parries of the trained naiads, and soon, the amateur soldiers forgot about the kissiae who did not attack."
0,All touched by the kissiae’s long ivy hair were injected with the toxin that made their minds more susceptible to influence.
0,A single command to attack the naiads was all they needed to divert attention.
1,The kissiae reached the tower and climbed as if their hands and feet adhered to the stone.
0,"Their movement was swift and quiet, ignored by the pandemonium on the outer wall despite being in direct sight if any soldier so much as turned around."
0,Two of the kissiae split out to the sides towards the wall walk and hid under the machicolations near the tower.
0,"Their ivy hair grew and spread across the wall, silently winding their rootlets into the boots and pant legs of all the soldiers near the tower."
0,The soldiers under the influence of the kissiae would not notice the remaining three who climbed past to the tower’s belvedere.
0,A massive fireball flew out over the topmost kissiae’s head towards the courtyard.
0,"She turned her head and saw that all the city’s soldiers had been eliminated, and the courtyard was filling with dryads."
0,"The few naiads were interspersed among the dryads to thwart any fire magic launched at them from the walls, but every face watched the approaching fireball in terror."
0,One naiad near the epicenter of impact threw her sword in desperation.
0,"The resfahil blade spun through the air and collided with the flame, melting instantly and causing a premature detonation."
0,"The fireball burst like a massive shower of sparks, only partially dispelled."
0,"Each spark that fell detonated on contact with the ground, coating its surroundings in an oil-like flame that clung to the dryads, naiads, and few Tolmyur soldiers."
0,"Their wailing death rows as they burned sounded over the roar of combat, followed shortly by the cheers of the city’s soldiers watching from the inner wall."
0,The kissiae climbed with renewed urgency.
0,They needed to reach the trespasser before she attacked again.
1,The first kissiae stopped just below the belvedere and sent her hair slithering up to seek out the trespasser.
0,"The first boot she touched near the edge was a fairy, and after reading her mind, she found their target."
0,The trespasser clung to the easternmost pillar.
0,She relayed the message to her sister kissiae closer to the target.
0,"That kissiae’s ivy hair crawled up and clung to the trespasser’s ankle and burnt off almost immediately, but that brief moment was enough."
0,I found the location of all the trespassers.
0,Three in total.
0,There is one with the widow in the temple and another at the city lord’s manor.
0,“Were you able to kill the fire mage?”
0,No.
0,She’s a flame-skin.
0,I could not hold on long enough.
0,“Dominate the soldiers atop the tower and use them to kill her before she escapes!”
0,The Mountain Elf pulled Chloe away from the edge the moment he noticed the strand of ivy grab her ankle.
0,"The kissiae had arrived, and in such a brief moment, their damage had been done."
0,Chloe was unable to stand.
0,"Her eyes, ears, and nose bled from some unknown internal trauma caused by the powerful dryad’s brief touch."
0,“Evacuate her quickly!
0,Take her to the Melian shaman!”
0,"When ivy quickly filled the floor of the tower, the Mountain Elf realized the one weakness in their guard."
0,None of the guard assigned to Chloe were fire mages.
0,"Fire mages were present on the tower, but none specifically tasked with Chloe’s watch and protection."
0,The few fire mages posted at the tower were dominated first and threw themselves off.
0,The Mountain Elf grabbed Chloe’s arm to lift her away from the rapidly spreading ivy and barely managed to pass her to two of the winged fairies before he felt an acute pain in his ankle.
0,He fought and resisted with all his might but was unable to stop the swing of his spear that struck down one of the winged fairies who shielded Chloe against the blow.
0,"The single fairy was unable to carry the unnaturally heavy woman, but the two remaining winged fairies grabbed Chloe’s legs and pulled her swiftly from the tower."
0,The dominated mages and archers fired desperately at Chloe as the winged fairies dove down into the upper tiers of the city to make use of the buildings to avoid attack.
0,One of the fairies carrying Chloe shouted a desperate order into her ear as they dived and weaved to narrowly avoid the attacks from their allies that struck the innocent civilians below.
0,"A single glowing orb formed in Chloe’s free hand, and it flew upwards towards the tower."
0,"Well done, the Mountain Elf praised in his mind before the fireball detonated, covering the entire belvedere in liquid flame that ran down the sides of the tower, incinerating the three kissiae who clung to the stone."
0,"Chapter 20
“The One Who Should Not Be Angered.”"
1,“One… three?” 
0,"“Is something the matter,” Emer asked Keeya."
0,"His mind was connected directly to her, so when she felt powerful emotion, those emotions often leaked into him."
0,"Right now, he felt terror and confusion, the most powerful he had ever experienced from her."
0,“Bad.
0,This bad!” Keeya screamed.
0,“Three kissiae die.
0,Three sisters just die!”
0,"Keeya activated her connection to all the kissiae that she had suppressed while in subjugation to Jethro as part of their agreement, but while she could feel their fear and anxiety, she could not find them."
0,They were too far away.
0,“We go Elos!”
1,"Keeya took control of Emer and instantly activated a transmission spell to the Dhuillir wetlands, surprising him."
0,"She had access to all his knowledge, so he expected her to be able to make use of spatial magic through him, but the speed at which she crafted the formula to take them to a destination Emer had never visited, meaning that she would have had to work out the destination coordinates on her own with little of his prior knowledge, was fascinating."
0,"Emer appeared on the dark humid island, but Keeya moved him with haste as if she could see as clear as day."
0,Every tree she made Emer touch she scanned for signs of life on their branches.
0,"Each tree found barren increased the worry Keeya felt until atop the grandest tree in the center of the island she found a single life, a kissiae child."
0,"Keeya forced Emer to climb the tree using strength he did not know he had, but his muscles ached terribly once he reached the top."
0,“What happen?
0,"Where everyone,” Keeya asked the young child who was possibly no more than a year old if she was elven."
0,"The child cowered at the sight of Emer, so Keeya hunched him over to align her face with the child’s."
0,“What happen?”
0,“Keeya…?
0,I missed you.” 
0,The small girl wrapped her arms around Keeya’s neck and cried.
0,"There was no one here, and that isolation had to be terrifying for someone so young."
0,"Keeya nuzzled the child’s cheek, unable to do anything else with her arms attached to Emer."
0,"“Where everyone go,” Keeya asked once the child calmed down."
0,"“Humans came, and everyone left."
0,I don’t know why.
0,They told me to stay.
0,I was too young.”
0,"Emer recalled the dismembered dryads they discovered in one of the palace’s kitchens, or perhaps he remembered it because Keeya remembered."
0,The chefs were forced to discover methods of cooking dryad.
0,"About that time a large army left Amel for Vallen, traveling through Dhuillir."
0,"“This is bad,” Emer said, fearing the worst."
0,He felt anger well up in Keeya.
0,She made the same connection.
0,“We should speak with General Lamek.
0,He would know.”
0,"Emer felt Keeya search his mind for the most probable location he would find General Lamek, but Emer did not know."
0,"Aside from his interactions with Jethro, he knew nothing of the military affairs of the palace or where the officers resided."
0,"It was very early morning, and the sun had yet to rise."
0,"General Lamek would be sleeping, and Emer did not know which of the many rooms of the palace he was using."
0,“We ask soldiers!”
1,"Another immediate transmission brought them to the central courtyard where soldiers were always posted, especially after Jethro’s emergency contact."
0,Keeya located the closest lieutenant and ensnared him in her ivy hair.
0,"The soldiers gathered quickly with angry shouts and weapon’s drawn, but a barrier appeared around them."
0,Emer did not erect it.
0,Keeya did.
0,"She was in full control of him now, all but his conscious mind."
0,"He witnessed the event unfold like an out of body experience, like watching a skilled puppeteer in action through the puppet’s eyes."
0,"Keeya’s hair dug under the soldier’s armor, and rootlets pierced his skin wherever they made contact."
0,"Just as quickly as Keeya ensnared the terrified soldier, she released him."
1,A third immediate transmission brought Emer to a dark room.
0,"From the appearance, it once belonged to one of the wives of Emperor Yuro."
0,"“LAMEK!” Keeya screamed, but her voice was more than sound."
0,It permeated Emer’s mind and echoed what his ears heard.
0,"The sensation made his head throb, and the agony was also felt by the dwarf writhing beneath the bedsheets."
0,General Lamek threw off his covers and eyed Emer with suspicion.
0,"“What are you doing in my quarters,” he demanded to know, reaching for a blade at his bedside."
0,“What happened to kissiae?
0,Tell me!” 
0,"Once again Keeya’s voice caused General Lamek to reel, preventing him from grabbing his weapon."
0,"After a wince and shake of his head, General Lamek glared at Keeya."
0,"“I have no reason to speak to one of Jethro’s slaves, especially concerning military action."
0,Leave.”
0,"“Tell me,” Keeya screamed."
0,"Emer’s hand reached out, and not even he knew what magic Keeya threaten."
0,She had all natural elements at her disposal through him.
0,“You are under Commanding General Jethro’s orders not to harm any of the Generals.
0,"Your rebellion will not go unpunished, dryad."
0,Jethro already bested you once.
0,"Leave, and I will not inform him of your actions tonight.”"
0,"Keeya hesitated, but her anger burned stronger."
0,Kissiae have died.
0,"Whatever bargain you made with Jethro is now void, Emer told Keeya through his thoughts."
0,Do what you must.
0,He cannot be angry with you if one of his subordinates broke the terms of your agreement.
0,That was all the persuasion Keeya required.
0,"Emer dove at General Lamek, but Lamek was prepared with a powerful torrent of wind blasted out his hand."
0,"The wind split harmlessly to the sides as if Emer was a wedge, and with a flick of Emer’s wrist, the extended arm severed at the shoulder."
0,"Emer landed atop Lamek, and Keeya’s hair bound him."
0,She pumped him so full of her toxin that his skin ruptured and Keeya’s long ivy hair wilted.
0,"His eyes rolled back, his mind broken from overdose."
0,"Emer expected Keeya to find answers, but the longer Keeya bound him, the greater her unbridled rage grew."
0,The ivy vines tightened as the cracking of bones grew louder until Keeya shredded the body apart in a spray of gore.
0,"What did you find, Emer asked, afraid of the answer after witnessing the brutal execution."
0,"“He not know,” Keeya replied, seething."
0,"“General Bregon going to Vallen, capture or kill and eat dryads on way."
0,Maybe capture and kill kissiae…”
0,But the kissiae are powerful.
0,Wouldn’t they be able to stop them?
0,"“No, they join soldiers."
0,Kissiae afraid of Jethro.
0,Jethro defeat me.
0,"Fire dryad weakness, but spatial magic greater weakness."
0,Jethro trap me in barrier before I attack.
0,"If I cannot touch, I cannot attack."
0,He threaten to kill all kissiae if I not help him.
0,"If I help, he promise to protect kissiae, like past Emper…”"
0,Keeya fell silent.
0,Keeya?
0,“No!
0,Two more dead!
0,Three!
0,Why?
0,Why this happen?!”
0,We must go to Vallen.
0,The campaign should be in northwestern Vallen by now.
1,"Emer thought of a location, one of the smaller villages on the flatlands, and Keeya teleported them there."
0,"The village square was barren, and decomposing corpses littered the ground around buildings that lay in blackened heaps."
0,Keeya paid no mind to the destruction.
0,"Now that she was closer, she sent out a mental communication."
0,“Kanazee!”
0,“Keeya?
0,Are you in Vallen?
0,We have an emergency.
0,Trespassers from another world are in Revlan.
0,I have taken control of Tolmyur’s armies to eliminate them.
0,We need your help.”
0,“You…?” 
0,Emer could feel shock and betrayal seep from Keeya’s emotions.
0,“You do this?
0,Kissiae die…”
0,“Only a few of us.
0,We have broken through the southeast gatehouse as well as the western and norther walls.
0,"The dangerous part is past for most of us, but they still have a powerful fire mage and a time mage."
0,We will need your assistance eliminating them.”
0,“No! Kissiae die!
0,You let kissiae die!” 
0,Emer felt physical pain through Keeya’s sorrow.
0,“Just now… another kissiae die.
0,Why you do this?!
0,Very few of us left!”
0,"“If our recovery is set back a few thousand years, it is better than inciting Gyea’s wrath for letting trespassers walk among us."
0,Such would doom us all.”
0,“I not afraid of Gyea!” 
0,Emer’s consciousness slipped for a moment due to the force of Keeya’s emotions.
0,"His mind and body burned, and he feared that if she did not calm, she would kill him without realizing."
0,"Keeya, please calm yourself."
0,“No!
0,I will not calm!
0,Kanazee betray kissiae.
0,Humans betray kissiae.
0,Elves betray kissiae.
0,Every race betray kissiae!
0,"They use us, kill us until none left."
0,But not Keeya!
0,Keeya protect kissiae even if I must kill all who betray us!”
0,We have not betrayed you.
0,“Elves of past no different.
0,They capture and use us.
0,Many kissiae die.”
0,"But, that was long ago."
0,“Quiet!” 
0,Emer’s consciousness faded.
1,Keeya searched for Kanazee’s location fearing that she may still be too far away to locate but found her not far to the west.
0,She appeared before Kanazee in an explosion of gore from the unfortunate naiad who had been present at the destination of the transmission.
0,"“Emer,” the giant next to Kanazee said in surprise, not bothered by the blood soaking Emer’s robes and Keeya’s hair thinking that it may have come from the unfortunate naiad."
0,“So the one you were in conversation with was Jethro’s kissiae.
0,Perfect.
0,Several kissiae have infiltrated the city and are on their way to the central district.
0,You can take us there directly.”
0,Byurk saw the fury in Keeya’s eyes and cowered.
0,The kissiae matriarch who he feared the moment he saw her was no more than a child to the wrathful being before him.
0,That overpowering aura must have been suppressed when he first saw Emer after his duel with Fect.
0,He looked up at General Bregon and wondered how he could not feel that same commanding presence.
0,"“This is not an ally,” Byurk warned ready to fight or flee for his life."
0,"He had never felt such fear, not even when face to face with a flock of dragons."
0,"“No,” Keeya said in direct defiance to General Bregon’s order."
0,"Emer’s hand extended, and Kanazee vanished."
0,"“What is the meaning of this,” General Bregon roared, but Keeya only viewed him as an insignificant insect unworthy of her time."
1,She vanished and appeared in the dense forest on the eastern side of the city.
0,The many dryads who had yet to storm the walls screamed and bowed before Keeya.
0,"Keeya reached out her mind across the city to locate all the Kissiae, sensing each and every one’s position and direction of motion."
0,"Emer’s hands dug into the soil, and all life died in the vicinity, spreading outward like a plague."
0,The trees wilted.
0,The dryads collapsed and withered.
0,"After a moment of deathly silence, the ground rumbled."
1,"* * *
Debin and Benab covered their faces from the choking smoke rising from the belvedere."
0,"Something happened below that required Chloe’s immediate evacuation, but while sitting atop the tower they were unable to know what, and the heat of the fire prevented them from descending to the belvedere."
0,Benab patted his father’s shoulder.
0,"“The forest,” he called through painful coughs."
0,"The entire eastern forest that had glowed faintly from behind Chloe’s firewall grew dark, and the trees shriveled into nothing."
0,"Shortly thereafter, the seemingly endless wave of dryads ceased."
0,"Cheers erupted on the outer wall from those who thought they had outlasted the dryad onslaught, but at the height atop the wall they could not see the dark omen beyond Chloe’s flames."
0,"The tower began to shake, and the rumbling grew audible like an approaching stampede of beasts."
0,"The rumbling grew to a quake until the earth in the distance burst, revealing massive vines as thick as Revlan’s walls."
0,They wove in and out of the ground like a sea serpent through water in their rapid approach towards the city.
0,What magic was this?
0,What sorcery?
0,How many dryads would have been needed to conjure such a massive plant?
0,Was the initial onslaught only to stall for time until such a force was conjured?
0,Was this the work of all the kissiae?
0,The only truth Debin knew was that the city was now doomed.
0,"“Evacuate the walls,” he screamed, but no amount of haste could save them."
0,"The vines tore through the stone, sending soldiers and large sections of wall hurling through the air and over the inner wall into the sunken city."
0,A pandemonium of screams erupted from the citizens as debris rained upon them and large sections of the inner wall blew inward.
0,"The vines divided and dug into the ground, creating massive fissures that collapsed walls, buildings, and towers."
0,One of the vines writhed and collided with the base of Debin and Benab’s tower.
0,Benab slipped and slid down the smooth tiling.
0,"Debin dove and caught his son before he fell, but his desperation could only delay the inevitable."
0,"The tower tilted as the vine dug through its base, and soon it careened forward."
0,There was no time to think.
0,Debin swung the arm clasping his son’s wrist.
0,He prayed to the gods and released his grip.
0,Benab collided with the soldiers atop the outer wall and watched his father fall with the burning tower into the space between the walls.
1,"* * *
“What are those vines?!"
0,Are they your kind’s doing?!”
0,A minum screamed at the kissiae atop her naiad’s shoulder.
0,“No!” 
0,"The kissiae was just as terrified of the massive plant that was rapidly pursuing them between and through the walls, destroying everything and everyone in their path, Revlan, dryad, and Tolmyur combatant alike."
0,She and her sisters were about to scale the inner wall on the south side to infiltrate the city before the unprejudiced destruction sent both enemy and ally into disarray.
0,"Fairies fled beside minums and elves beside humans without hostility, caring only for their own lives, but the vines were too quick."
0,"They struck the ground, sending the Tolmyur soldiers and naiads tumbling forward and battering them with debris."
0,"It slithered over them, and the moment it touched a kissiae, she vanished with a light pop."
0,The naiads and soldiers with them were ground into the earth under the plant’s massive weight.
1,"The vine immediately divided and changed course, one outside the city and one through the inner wall into the city."
0,"The wall collapsed inward, and the writhing of the vine sent massive chunks of stone and buildings cascading down the tiers."
0,"It weaved north where two Kissiae fled in terror, not from the vines but from the elves in the forge district."
0,"While most citizens never learned magic for combat, fire was different, being destructive by nature."
0,"Most of the smiths and forgery workers held fire affinities, something these two younger kissiae were unaware of having been sheltered in Elos all their lives."
0,A fireball flew overhead and collided with the top of the building they scaled to flee.
0,The younger of the two cried from the fire that fell and burned their arms and shoulders.
0,"“Go around, I’ll hold them off,” the elder sister ordered, but the youngest was too afraid now to move."
0,Fire was beneath them and now fire was above them.
0,"They were surrounded by people they could control, but their ivy hair would never reach them through the flames."
0,"“Go,” she screamed before descending to buy what little time she could for her sister to escape."
0,"The naiads who protected them could not scale the steep walls, so when their acting matriarch gave the order for the kissiae to infiltrate the city on their own, she was hesitant."
0,Neither she nor her sister had any experience in combat or stealth.
0,"They cleared the wall easily due to the simple manipulation of the unaware soldiers at the top, but the city was far too crowded."
0,There was nowhere they could go without being in sight of someone.
0,"The moment they were forced to manipulate and kill a single citizen, a target was painted on their backs."
0,"Every fire mage closed in on them, and in their flight, they found themselves in the lowest tier of the city where almost solely fire mages resided."
0,"Two well aimed fireballs approached, and the elder sister was forced to use her hair to block them."
0,"The explosion burned her body, and her elegant ivy hair fell in cinders to the ground."
0,"She survived the impact, but the flames clung to her body in burning agony that dryad pain tolerance could not ignore."
0,"She looked up with hope that her sister fled, but she remained motionless on the corner of the structure, her eyes glued to something behind them."
0,Both the kissiae and the elves that pursued them had been unaware of the approaching destruction.
0,"The cries of fear and death reached their ears, and the shaking ground threatened to rip her fingers from the stone."
0,Massive vines as thick as buildings cascaded down the city tiers in their direction.
0,"“Run,” she screamed to her sister before her burning body gave out and fell to the ground where the fleeing trampled her under foot."
0,"The massive vine rolled over the district destroying everything in its path, and the younger sister who could not move for the fear vanished the moment the vine collided with the burning building."
1,"* * *
Keeya counted every kissiae touched by the massive vines that were an extension of her, teleporting them instantly via transmission out of harm’s way."
0,Her urgency grew by the second.
0,A kissiae died and then another.
0,"Some of the naiads were carrying their charges away from the vines that were there to save them while other kissiae were captured inside the city being executed or tortured, further infuriating Keeya."
0,"“Release the kissiae or die,” Keeya screamed into the minds of every soul inside the city."
0,The naiads stopped fleeing allowing the kissiae to be recovered at the cost of being crushed to death by the massive vines.
0,"The citizens of the city who had cornered the kissiae that failed to infiltrate to the city center fled in panic as the writhing vines tore up buildings to reach the helpless kissiae, but for some, the vines were too late."
0,The last three kissiae were already in the city center.
0,"Keeya could feel them, but the emotions of the three were of terror."
0,There was a monster of fire there from whom they fled.
0,"All vines converged on the central district, tearing through the upper tiers of the city and then the walls in their haste."
0,"An enormous orange light glowed in the distance from the center of the city, visible above the demolished outer walls."
0,Keeya watched the plume of flame rise into the dark night.
0,"In that same moment, she felt the lives of the last three kissiae vanish."
0,Fury and sorrow enveloped Keeya so intense that Emer’s glazed eyes shed a fountain of tears and the veins of his body bulged.
0,"She sent her vines deep into the stone beneath the central district to destroy the foundation, fracturing the elevated city and sending large sections sliding into the sunken tiers below."
0,The massive shift of land sent tremors out into the forests and fields beyond.
0,"And then, the vines grew still."
0,"The fountain of tears spread to Keeya’s eyes as her emotions pulled inward, relieving Emer of his torment."
0,Fifteen dead and twenty-nine rescued.
0,A third of the Kissiae remaining on Whinhlem were lost in a single night.
0,"Keeya cried as she removed Emer’s hands from the soil, snapping the roots wound about his fingers."
0,The forest and city were silent.
0,The sounds of battle no longer echoed through the night.
0,"Keeya vanished, leaving the destruction of Revlan behind her."
0,"Chapter 21
“Tolmyur’s Target”"
1,The soldiers stationed to protect the officers back at the camp stared in awe at the ruins of Revlan glowing against the yellow flames the distance.
0,"They felt the quake, witnessed the massive vines tear down the walls, and watched the city crumble."
0,Many still shook from the agonizing message that rang in their heads demanding the release of the kissiae.
0,"The weak-minded huddled against the ground, hands on their helmets, crying for the words to silence in their minds."
0,"Only the hardened soldiers who had witnessed the harsh battles of the past were mostly unaffected, but even among the unaffected, some still worried over what evil they may have ignorantly awakened."
0,"“We have made enemies with someone dangerous,” Byurk said to General Bregon."
0,“I disagree.
0,The kissiae joined of their own will and led us in the attack.
0,"If the kissiae enslaved by Commanding General Jethro truly believed that we forced them, she may have killed us where we stood."
0,We would not have had the power to stop her.
0,"From the message, we can assume she arrived solely to retrieve her kind, and once finished, she left.”"
0,“Jethro’s agreement with her was to continue their protection.
0,This does not bode well.”
0,"“General Byurk, I understand that you have personal history with our Commanding General, but as a general, you should use proper titles when before your fellow soldiers.” “Yes, sir.” “And to address your concern, this may be fortuitous for us."
0,"“Yes, sir.”"
0,"“And to address your concern, this may be fortuitous for us."
0,"Commanding General Jethro bested that kissiae to subjugate her kind, a testament to his power after what we just witnessed."
0,"I do not believe she will rebel out of fear of him, and now we know we have one with greater power than the otherworlders on our side."
0,"In truth, she has given us a golden opportunity."
0,Most of our army is still without the walls at the edges of the forests.
0,Only a few groups followed the naiads and kissiae inside.
0,"Among all the casualties, we should have sustained the least."
0,Our time to strike is now when the city is open and recovering.”
0,General Bregon called Lieutenant Mackrum.
0,“Send messengers to all the awaiting forces surrounding Revlan.
0,Each contacted force is to send out five more messengers to search for scattered parties.
0,Those they find should send out two messengers of their own.
0,Continue that propagation until every survivor has been reached.
0,Order them to gather all those who are still combat-able to the northeast.
0,Beat them if you must recover their senses.
0,We need to make haste and pierce deep to the inner city before the enemy has time to recuperate and rally its people.”

A faint orange glow permeated the gaps and cracks in the rubble."
0,"Cinders from the braziers were scattered and smoldering, but it was impossible to tell from where."
0,At least they provided enough light to barely see the outlines of the rubble.
0,"Ceil’s vision was blurry, and she realized that she had been unconscious, but for how long?"
0,"“Are you okay,” Justin moaned, his voice strained and breath heavy."
0,Ceil rubbed her eyes to help them find focus.
0,"Her body ached, and she could feel blood from her forehead running down and dripping from her cheek."
0,"“I am unharmed,” she replied after scanning her body with life magic for injury."
0,"Aside from a few cuts and bruises, she was uninjured."
0,She looked up at the large slabs of stone.
0,Somehow Justin was able to find a location where the collapsing stone would not crush her.
0,Surely his time magic was to thank for this miracle.
0,The events all happened too fast for Ceil to process.
0,"The floor beneath them suddenly dropped ten feet, and the impact and subsequent tremors collapsed the walls and ceiling of the temple."
0,"Justin grabbed her and dodged the falling stone, diving into the column framing the end of the corridor."
0,He covered her with his shield until all went dark.
0,"His arm and shield pressed heavily and painfully into her back, but she was alive and mostly unharmed--a miracle indeed."
0,A sudden fear crossed Ceil’s mind.
0,"She shifted her arm out from under her, tearing the vibrant purple fabric of her jack against the coarse stone, and placed her hand on Justin’s cheek."
0,A sigh of relief passed her lips.
0,"Justin was slightly more battered, but he was not severely injured, and none of his limbs were pinned under the heavy rubble."
0,The last thing Ceil wanted was for Justin to be fatally injured or un-savable because he chose to shield her instead of himself.
0,She could not stand watching Sammy suffer from his loss.
0,"“I’m fine,” Justin said, pulling Ceil’s hand from his face, “but the shield is stuck."
0,I can’t move my arm.”
0,Ceil reached to her hip to retrieve the small dagger provided to her for emergency protection.
0,She felt around her back for the location of the leather enarmes and carefully slid the dagger between them and Justin’s arm.
0,"The leverage available to her in the cramped space was little, especially with her arm twisted around her back, but it was just enough to jiggle the blade and cut into the leather."
0,"The first strap snapped, but the second was further across her back."
0,"She could only reach it with the tip of the knife and had to flick the tip against the leather, slowly and carefully chewing through it."
0,“Try and slide your arm out when I exhale… Now.” 
0,"Ceil breathed out, and Justin tried to pull his arm up her back."
0,"He applied a bit too much force causing it to slip out and knock her in the back of the head, but he was free."
0,"“Sorry,” Justin said."
0,Ceil blinked off the sudden impact.
0,"Without his arm, she had a little more movement."
0,"She tried shimmying forward, but there was too little room."
0,"Instead, she pushed against the rubble beside her to slide closer to Justin."
0,The shield shifted with the large slab of stone.
0,"Justin grabbed Ceil and pulled her into his chest as the slab buckled, pinning the shield beneath it."
0,The movement sent a cascade of rubble crumbling and shifting in the collapsed temple out of sight from their cramped space.
0,Justin covered Ceil’s head until the shifting ceased.
0,"Much above them may be unstable, and at any moment they knew the ancient stone could give way and crush them as it did the shield where Ceil had just been."
0,"“Can we even get out of here,” Justin whispered, his breath caressing Ceil’s ear."
0,“I do not want to hear that from the one man who was able to find the only place that could save us from the collapse.
0,"There were earth mages among those with us in the temple… but without your reflexes, they may not have been able to react in time.”"
0,Ceil careened her neck to look above them.
0,There was a gap in the stone possibly large enough to squeeze through.
0,“How much movement do you have?”
0,"“I can move my legs just fine,” Justin said, testing his range of movement."
0,“Can you slide backwards?”
0,Justin curled his legs and shifted down Ceil until his head was on her thighs.
0,This gave Ceil enough room to twist her torso and sit up in the thin space.
0,"She reached her arm into the gap and found the other side open, at least as far as she could reach."
0,“I will try to go up.
0,"I trust you to pull me back if something shifts,” Ceil said."
0,"“Do not try to move anything that is not already loose,” Justin warned."
1,"Ceil reached her other arm through, and with Justin pushing her legs, she squeezed her shoulders past the gap."
0,The rest of her body followed with relative ease.
0,"The stone slab beneath her felt solid, now settled after the recent shift and collapse."
0,Above her was one of the many decorative stone arches from the ceiling.
0,"It was not a window but a shallow concave ornamentation, and the cavity provided enough room for her to crouch."
0,"The glow of the few cinders was a bit brighter here, just enough for her to see where loose rubble collected."
0,She cleared away whatever loose stones she could find to look for a second gap.
0,One caused a cascade of sand and gravel onto her face and into her eyes.
0,Ceil reeled back and held in her cry to not worry Justin.
0,"After wiping her face and blinking away what sand she could, she investigated from where the loose gravel poured."
0,The gap was slightly smaller than the first.
0,She and Justin could pass through but not with their armor.
0,"“Justin, I might have found a way further up.”"
0,"Justin’s arms appeared from the gap below, and he barely managed to shimmy through."
0,“We need to remove our armor or we will not fit.”
0,Justin immediately got to work unlacing Ceil’s Jack and skirt.
0,They then worked together to remove the many sections of Justin’s armor.
0,Ceil in her bind and underskirt slid her lithe frame through the new opening.
0,“There is space here.
0,"We will have to climb,” she said."
0,"Justin reached his arm through, and ceil tried to pull him up, but his shoulders caught."
0,He was too broad.
0,Justin dropped back down and tried a different angle with only one arm through.
0,He tilted his shoulders and squeezed them together as close as he could with his other arm pressed against his side.
0,"The second shoulder passed, but his tunic tore, and as Ceil pulled, the sharp stone cut down his arm."
0,He was through.
1,Justin breathed heavy through his teeth to fight the pain.
0,"Ceil wanted to stem the bleeding, but she could not risk the harm her magic might cause him."
0,"She felt safe using life magic on Sammy because of how much she cared for her, but she feared that her hatred of Justin might trigger that dark magic, causing far greater harm."
0,"Instead, she removed her bind and wrapped the long cut tightly."
0,Ceil looked at the injury with a new worry.
0,“Can you climb with that arm?”
0,“I will manage.
0,We don’t have a choice.”
0,The cavity was slender but tall.
0,The section of wall to their right caved inwards catching on another that collapsed to meet it.
0,"Rubble filled most the gap, but near the top there was a crack where the wall broke from the ceiling."
0,It was large enough to crawl through and hopefully would lead somewhere they could scale the rubble or at least give more options to climb higher out of the temple.
0,"Justin stared at Ceil from her head to her skirt, his eyes lingering on the latter."
0,“I will climb first.”
0,"“No. You already saw my tails at the meeting of commanders, so it is no matter.”"
0,"“That’s not what I mean,” Justin protested, causing Ceil to blush angrily for thinking his usual consideration was the reason."
0,“I can react faster if something is unsafe.”
0,"“Again, no."
0,"Your arm is injured, and your body is heavy."
0,I am the better climber.
0,You will need my help to climb through the crack.” 
0,Ceil began scaling the broken wall before Justin had time to argue further.
0,The cracks along its length gave plentiful grip but were difficult to locate in the dark.
0,"The higher she climbed, the closer the far wall came until she could prop one leg against it."
0,"With one hand clinging to the edge of the large crack they would need to climb through and her legs spread to reach strong holds on both walls, she reached down with her free hand to beckon Justin."
0,"He began his ascent, but after looking up, he turned his head, choosing instead to feel for the next grip."
0,"His consideration was the issue, much to her annoyance, and it showed when it was most dangerous."
0,“Fool!
0,I said it was no matter.
0,Look where you are gripping before you fall!”
0,Justin was infuriating.
0,All his so-called good characteristics that Sammy praised were a cause for nothing but trouble and annoyance to Ceil.
0,"She watched with nervous anticipation as his arms trembled with each new grip, and when he was close enough, she grabbed his outstretched arm so that he would not have to climb the steep angle at the top as she did."
0,"She strained under his weight as she helped him reach the crack, and once he had an elbow through, she let go of her grip, praying that her legs held."
0,She used both hands below his feet to hoist him up.
1,"“Ceil, you need to see this.” Justin reached down and pulled Ceil up."
0,"From atop the wall, they could see the pile of rubble at the bottom of the inner sanctum."
0,"There were no bodies or movement, and the location they had been buried was the only place where most the rubble kept its shape to allow for gaps."
0,Justin’s time magic was not the only force at play.
0,"They were lucky, simply lucky."
0,"The far wall had collapsed outward revealing the dark night sky and the upper tiers of the city’s edge through the corridors and rooms that surrounded the inner sanctum, but something felt off."
0,The city lay at a slant.
0,The most troubling revelation was the gargantuan vines that had ripped through the walls and buildings and now stood motionless as terrible monuments to the destruction they wrought.
0,This was not damage that Tolmyur could have caused.
0,"“Did the kissiae do this,” Ceil asked, remembering the painful message that had entered her mind before the disaster."
0,“I don’t know…”
0,"They needed to leave the temple, and the opening on the other side was their best option."
0,Ceil took the lead and climbed down the other side of the sloping wall to the pile of rubble.
0,"Justin followed carefully behind her, but his injured arm nearly slipped multiple times, making Ceil tense."
0,"She wanted to look for survivors, but she knew there would be no hope for them."
0,"The corridor had collapsed with only the pillars framing the end standing, and the rubble beneath their feet was too fine to allow for gaps someone could have survived in."
0,"Only an earth mage or a competent life mage could detect any bodies below the rubble, and Ceil was neither."
0,Something caught Ceil’s eye in the corner of the room.
0,"She hopped over the rubble to a slender piece of wood protruding from the rubble, her staff."
0,"She pulled at it, not wanting to lose another, but it would not budge."
0,"Justin was about to help, but she stopped him."
0,There was plentiful life in it unlike her last staff when the hamadryad rooted in Melia.
0,She used some of that life to sever it where the stone held and retrieved the piece no longer than half her forearm.
0,"“This is enough,” she assured Justin."
0,"“It will take a few days, but I can regrow it.”"
0,“Your Highness!” 
0,Ceil and Justin looked up to see Kiri flying above the collapsed roof.
0,"Ceil did not even know Kiri could fly, but she was relieved that she was able to survive the collapse, possibly because of her wings."
0,Kiri quickly flew away and returned with two others.
0,"They descended to the rubble, their expressions exuding relief."
0,“We will take you to safety.”
0,"“No, take Justin first,” Ceil ordered."
0,"Justin protested, but the fairies were quick to obey."
0,They grabbed his arms and lifted him slowly into the air.
0,Ceil did not have to wait long.
0,A second pair followed shortly after along with Kiri.
0,“What of your armor?” Kiri asked.
0,“Under the rubble.” Ceil pointed to the large slabs of stone near the pillars of the corridor where she and Justin had abandoned it.
0,“You will need it.
0,I will search.
1,"Go,” she ordered the fairies, and they lifted Ceil out of the temple."
0,The sight of the destruction around the city stole Ceil’s breath.
0,The city was not at a slant.
0,The entire central district was.
0,"Large and deep fissures broke it apart, and much of the eastern side had slid into the lower tiers."
0,"The vines she saw from within the temple were all around the city, coiled within the immense destruction and converging at the center."
0,She could see people moving through the destruction trying to help themselves and rescue others.
0,"Never in her wildest nightmares could she have imagined such a disaster, but the nightmare was not finished."
0,Ceil’s heart raced with panic.
0,“To the north!
0,Tolmyur!”
0,Tolmyur soldiers were pouring through an opening in the north wall.
0,They followed the smooth trail of rubble left behind by the vines down the tiers and then across the vines to the north side of the central district.
0,Ceil was now positive that the destruction of the city was caused by the kissiae so that the soldiers could reach her.
0,"All the vines converged on the central district, creating easy paths to walk upon and avoid the maze of buildings and stairways."
1,The fairies flew her down to where many soldiers gathered.
0,A few of the Melians were present as was Chloe and Dharin.
0,"“Tolmyur soldiers are arriving at the north end of the central district,” Ceil screamed."
0,"“Our fliers already spotted them moments before,” Dharin replied."
0,"“We are trying to gather as many soldiers as we can on the other side of the fissure to delay them, but the devastation is too widespread, and with the fissure and wall, it’s mostly isolated."
0,They organized much quicker than we could.”
0,“Can you not see this was planned from the start?!
0,Of course they would be organized!
0,We need to take Chloe over there quickly!”
0,"“You rely too heavily on Lady Chloe,” Dharin chastised."
0,“She nearly died to the kissiae before the disaster.”
0,"“I know I do, but she’s the most powerful mage we have."
0,"We need to save Sammy, save everyone.”"
0,"“We already tried retrieving Sammy and Lemi, but they refused."
0,"Sammy said she did not want another repeat of Gullivan, and I assume you understand better than I what she means by that.”"
0,“The destruction of her city…” Ceil whispered to herself.
0,“Take me there.
0,"Bring Chloe, the Melians, everyone you can.”"
0,"“I will not place you in further danger,” Dharin replied."
0,“This is an order as your Empress!” 
0,Stunned gazes bore down on Ceil.
0,"Even after surviving such a harrowing disaster, she demanded to be at the front to protect her friends and her people."
0,Dharin frowned.
0,"He was proud of his great-granddaughter, but heroism was often detrimental in war."
0,It only led to death.
0,"Gritting his teeth, he gave the order."
0,“You heard her!
0,Organize as many wings as you can to take those fit for battle across the fissure.
0,Locate enough earth mages to build a bridge in the meantime.
0,"Those who arrive first, hold off the enemy until our main force can arrive.”"
0,"Ceil grabbed Dharin’s armor, turning him to face her."
0,Her hand shook with anger.
0,She could not believe the order she just heard.
0,“You were not already preparing to send soldiers to the north?
0,Were you planning to abandon them?!”
0,"“With our forces scattered and how isolated that section of the central district now is, we are at a severe disadvantage with the enemy approaching in mass."
0,"Abandoning it so that we can better situate ourselves drastically increases our chance of survival, but yes, all the nobles, their guards, servants, the orphanage, and everyone who chose to stay would be lost, including your friends."
0,This is our last chance to turn away the Tolmyur filth.
0,"If we lose here, we lose Revlan, and your order has made victory far more difficult for us.”"
0,"“I will not change my mind,” Ceil said flatly."
0,“I know.
0,You are too much like a fairy in that regard.
0,"We will take you to the north so you can fight with us, but you will join the main force and wait until we bridge the fissure."
0,I will not yield on this matter.”
0,“Fine.” 
0,Ceil walked away from Dharin.
0,"She understood that in war, sacrifices were sometimes needed to better ensure victory, but she could not accept it."
0,"If there was a chance that they could save Sammy, Lemi, and the orphanage, she wanted to take that chance."
0,"Right now, all those who were important according to the sprites were here: Chloe, Justin, and herself."
0,"If the calamity was still to come, and if they were important to the events that would soon take place, perhaps having the three of them there on the north side of the central district would increase their chance of victory."
0,"Ceil placed her hope on Chloe’s words, that they would not die so easily, and the only way they would die is if the district was lost."
1,Ceil located Chloe and Justin with the Melians who were stationed at manors on this side of the fissure.
0,"She noticed just how badly Chloe was injured from the dried blood on her face that ran from her ears, nose, and eyes."
0,"Tyree was treating Justin’s arm and his other injuries, but once she saw Ceil, she quickly stopped and beckoned her over."
0,"“No, finish him first,” Ceil ordered."
0,"“Chloe, Justin, you are going over to the orphanage ahead of me.”"
0,"“What about you,” Justin asked."
0,“I’m supposed to protect you.”
0,Ceil gritted her teeth but took a breath so she would not shout.
0,“You fulfilled your role at the temple splendidly.
0,Consider yourself dismissed.
0,"Tolmyur’s army is entering the north side of the central district, which is why you are needed there."
0,"Instead of worrying about me, you should worry about your woman."
0,"Sammy needs you far more than I. I must wait until we can organize our soldiers, but then I will be joining you."
0,You will have to hold out until then…” 
0,Ceil gripped her skirt and tried to prevent her jaw from quivering.
0,“Please hold out until then.”
0,"Chapter 22
“For the Protection of Those Held Dear”"
1,"Sammy ran down the stairs of the central hall of Lord Olvor’s manor, nearly tripping on rubble scattered over the steps."
0,"A sack of clean rags she retrieved from a storage closet on the third floor was tucked tightly under her arm, and a roll of bandages was in her other hand."
0,“Has anyone located Yasef yet?” she called.
0,“No.”
0,“Not yet!” 
0,A few fairy maids called back answers as they ran to and from the many rooms lining both the first and second floor of the hall.
0,All 308 children except one had been accounted for after the tremors that rocked the central district.
0,The destruction on the north side of the district was fortunately less than others.
0,"From what Sammy could see from the third floor, the temple grounds in the middle of the district were at a slant, and an entire section of the district to the east had disappeared."
0,"Now that they were informed that enemy soldiers were also on their way and could very well be entering the district at this very moment, everyone was scrambling to locate and secure the children."
0,No help would be coming for them.
0,"The north was isolated, and Sammy wondered if they would survive an encounter with the Tolmyur army."
0,She passed the rags and bandages off to a pair of Melians treating the injured children and located Lord Olvor by the entrance.
0,“Olvor!
0,What of the other nobles?!”
0,Lord Olvor sneered at Sammy as she approached.
0,"She knew he disliked her, mostly because she was human, but he was not one to let personal feelings get in the way during an emergency."
0,"“Hurn and Dollen both died in the quakes, but their families agreed to lend their guards and servants."
0,They should be arriving shortly.
0,"As for the lesser nobles, they have no choice but to listen to me."
0,Their households and guards will aid us in defense.
0,That gives us about fifty more.”
0,“That few?” 
0,“Most of our soldiers were at the temple grounds.
0,You see what good that does us now.”
0,“Do you know how many of them will need bows?
0,Lemi has started creating them from those bamboo plants in your garden.
0,I can tell her to increase the number.”
0,“Bamboo?
0,I have no idea.
0,The families’ guards should have their own weapons but only Dollen’s family regularly trained.
0,Have her make twenty more just in case.”
0,“On it.” 
0,Sammy ran past Lord Olvor out the door.
1,"The dark morning was lit by an ominous orange glow from the fires around the city, and the giant vines that had caused the destruction sent painful shivers down Sammy’s back."
0,She shook her head to try and not dwell on what was beyond her control and ran to the garden on the west side of the manor.
0,"Lemi had spotted a small bamboo forest there when they arrived, and the second they learned of the approaching enemy, she ran there to make weapons."
0,"Sammy quickly located Lemi, amazed at how much of the small forest had disappeared."
0,"Two piles of bows lay behind her, one with many short bows that fairies could use, and the other pile contained nine bows that were even larger and thicker than what Sammy expected a longbow would be."
0,Sammy picked up one of the longbows and tried to pull the string.
0,It wouldn’t budge.
0,"“No one is going to be able to use these,” Sammy protested."
0,"Lemi finished growing what looked like a hundred arrows from a branch of bamboo, making it appear like a massive pine bough."
0,"“Maybe only a Mountain Elf would be strong enough to pull the string,” she said while shaking them loose like dead needles."
0,“But all these nobles only employ fairies!”
0,Lemi picked up one of the bows that was as tall as her and pulled the string.
0,The wood bent back with a creak.
0,The form looked terribly menacing.
0,She then slowly relaxed the string to not dry-fire the bow.
0,“You need to use life magic to draw it.
0,The wood is strong but flexible and has very good recoil.
0,These are for me and the other eight Melians.
0,"Their matriarch, Preelen, is really good with the bow, so maybe those in her village might be able to use them well, too.”"
0,"“Olvor says we might need twenty more fairy bows, but…” Sammy looked at the large pile, “you might have enough here already."
0,I’ll take them to the front of the manor so we can distribute them.”
0,Sammy swung eight of the longbows over her back and packed her arms full of as many of the shortbows as she could carry.
1,She ran to the front walkway near a fountain where the walkway split between the different houses of the manor and the servant’s quarters.
0,The guards and families of the other nobles were beginning to gather.
0,"“Those of you who need bows, here!”"
0,She slid the bows off her arms at their feet.
0,"“Remember that even though you are nobles, you are fighting for your lives, so if you cannot use any other weapons, grab one."
0,I will be back with more bows and some arrows in a bit.”
1,Sammy ran back to the main house and into the central hall.
0,“Preelen!”
0,A Melian poked her head out one of the rooms on the second floor.
0,"After seeing Sammy, she jumped down from the mezzanine."
0,"“Here, these are for you and the other Melians."
0,You’ll need to use life magic to draw them.”
0,Preelen inspected one of the bows.
0,“Lemi made these?
0,That child has a talent!”
0,“About the arrows…” 
0,"“Just give each one of us a single stalk of that plant, and we should be able to make them as we need them.”"
0,“No.
0,That might be too slow.
0,I’ve seen Lemi grow arrows.
0,It would be faster if you already have them on hand and can fire them quickly.
0,I was wondering if you could send one or two of you to help Lemi finish all the arrows for everyone else as well.”
0,“I’ll send someone over immediately.”
0,"“Thanks,” Sammy said before running back to the door."
0,“Take a moment to breathe!
0,You look like you’re about to faint!”
0,“I’ll be fine!” Sammy assured her before heading outside back to Lemi.
1,"Her lungs burned and her legs ached, but she could not stop."
0,She did not have time to stop.
0,"Sammy doubted she would be able to do much once the fighting started, so she wanted to be as much use as possible while they prepared."
0,"“Preelen is sending someone to help with arrows,” Sammy informed Lemi before grabbing as many shortbows as she could carry and returning to the fountain."
0,"“More shortbows,” Sammy said as she set down the bow at the nobles’ feet."
0,She nearly fell forward on top of the pile.
0,"“You need to slow down a little,” one of the noble women said with mild worry on her face."
0,“We don’t have time to slow down!
0,You should all be getting ready instead of standing here!”
0,"“The soldiers have passed the curtain wall,” a fairy scout cried before flying back to monitor the enemy’s progress."
0,“See!
0,Damn it!” 
1,Sammy ran back toward the main house.
0,"The central district was large, but it was not that large."
0,"If the enemy army was at the walls, they were only about a mile away."
0,She stumbled through the doorway and fell to her knees.
0,"“Enemy has passed the walls,” she called."
0,“They will be here soon!
0,Move the children to the cellars and… and…”
0,She ran out of breath.
0,“… damn it…” 
0,“You heard her!
0,"Move the children to the cellars, prep kitchens, and storage rooms,” the head butler echoed, and all the maids and manservants went into frenzy."
0,Children were brought out of rooms on the upper floors and led down the steps to be escorted to the basement of the manor.
1,"Preelen jumped down from the mezzanine and lifted Sammy, helping her outside where the guards were gathered."
0,"“You have done enough,” she said."
0,"“Like hell I have,” Sammy retorted, confusing Preelen with her odd phrasing."
0,"“The walls around the manor grounds will give us some defense,” Sammy heard one of the guards say when she approached."
0,"“A single earth mage will make short work of them,” a second countered."
0,"“We cannot hope to fight them on the open road with our numbers against theirs,” Lord Olvor replied, silencing the argument."
0,“We will use my manor as best we can for cover.”
0,"“What of the children,” one of the women asked."
0,"“We have sent them to the basement and cellars,” Sammy replied, winded."
0,"“I will take my sisters to the rooftops and pick them off before they reach your grounds,” Preelen announced. "
0,"“We will focus on mages first, but we probably will not be able to take down dwarves or giants with their armor.” "
0,“The dwarves are the most dangerous.
0,They are armored and use magic.
0,"If any of the enemy can take down the walls, it’s them.”"
0,"“They are avoiding the manors,” another scout announced."
0,"“They might be heading directly for the temple grounds, but they will not be able to reach them."
0,And they will see us first.
0,You have your positions.
0,Go!” Lord Olvor ordered.
0,"The guards, servants, and noble families scattered at Lord Olvor’s call."
1,Sammy was about to run back to Lemi when she noticed a pair of High Elf soldiers running through the entrance gate to the manor grounds.
0,Lord Olvor also noticed and ran with Sammy and Preelen to meet them.
0,"“By command of Empress Ceil, the orphanage will not be abandoned,” the soldier announced."
0,That was the best news Sammy could have hoped to hear.
0,"After seeing the temple in ruins, she feared that Justin and Ceil might be hurt or worse."
0,"Running up behind the soldier were another three, and behind them were Chloe and Justin."
0,"“What are you doing here,” Sammy screamed at them."
0,"“We’re here to help,” Justin replied."
0,"“The Tolmyur soldiers are already here,” she cried."
0,“We know.
0,We saw from the air.
0,"Ceil is having the flying fairies carry reinforcements over the ravine, so they should be arriving slowly."
0,"Once bridges are built, a lot more will be coming.”"
0,"“I’ll guard the road,” Chloe said, flagging several High Elves to follow her."
0,"“Chloe,” Sammy called, but Chloe ignored her."
0,She punched Justin in the arm.
0,“You were supposed to stay where it was safe!”
0,“I’m here to help keep you safe.
0,"After all, you can’t do much with your magic,” Justin replied."
0,"Sammy wanted to punch Justin again for turning her past depreciating remarks against her, but she could not argue."
0,She looked around and found that Preelen had already left.
0,"If they were to climb to the fenced roof before the Tolmyur soldiers got within range of arrow distance, they needed to hurry."
0,“We’re going to the roof.” 
1,Sammy pulled Justin back to the manor and found Lemi climbing the side.
0,“Doesn’t she know there is a roof entrance?”
0,They paid her no mind and ran inside and up the steps to the third floor and then to a spiral staircase to the rooftop garden.
0,Lemi met them with two other Melians.
0,"From there they could see the approaching army, and Sammy’s heart sank."
0,There were thousands of them.
0,"At most, Lord Olvor’s manor had maybe a hundred combatants, and Dharin’s reinforcements were trickling in as fast as whatever number of flying fairies he had remaining could carry them over."
0,"By their speed of arrival, Sammy could not think there were any more than ten winged fairies."
0,That was far too slow to make any dent in the enemy army or bolster their forces fast enough to put up a solid resistance.
0,“I got one!” Lemi cheered.
0,"Unknown to Sammy, the Melians had already begun firing."
0,Her fears had drowned out the twang of the bows.
0,"The army was not yet at the wall surrounding the manor grounds, but apparently it was close enough for the Melians to make use of their archery."
0,"The other Melian’s frustration showed that she was not having the same luck, but a second cheer from Lemi hinted that every arrow she loosed hit its mark."
0,Sammy looked out to the rooftops of the second house and the servant’s house and saw that a few of the other Melians were having similar success.
0,Preelen was particularly astonishing.
0,"She was firing at twice the rate of Lemi, her posture emanating the confidence that each arrow loosed would hit her target."
0,"“Lemi, stop talking and focus,” Sammy rebuked."
0,"Even with their archers picking off a few soldiers every couple of seconds, it wasn’t enough."
0,Not nearly enough.
0,Not even close.
0,"They would need a hundred Melians, not eight, and even then it would only slow the enemy a little."
0,An explosion rose from the road just past the manor grounds.
0,"Chloe encountered the army, but the size of the explosion was much smaller than what Sammy knew Chloe was capable."
0,"Either she was trying to conserve her ven or she already had little at her disposal, possibly both."
0,It’s not enough!
0,"Anxiety ate at Sammy’s stomach, causing it to sting."
0,She felt like vomiting.
0,"“This doesn’t look good,” Justin said from beside her."
0,“I know that!
0,Damn it!
0,"Oh, god…”"
0,“Sammy.” 
0,Sammy screamed and fell to her back.
0,A transparent feminine figure hovered above the railing where her face had just been.
0,“Ephora?
0,Are you here to help?” Justin pulled Sammy to her feet.
0,"“We just finished our predictions, and I am here to tell you that you lose."
0,"I specifically warned you not to anger the kissiae, and this is the result.”"
0,“We didn’t do anything to anger the kissiae!
0,They did this on their own!
0,They are the ones who chose to attack us!” 
0,Sammy’s voice squealed in her desperation.
0,"“I gave ample warning so you could take preventative measures, but you did nothing."
0,"Now Chloe, Justin, and Ceil are going to die."
0,"We can manage without one of them, perhaps two, but not all three, and if Ceil is lost here, so is your future.”"
0,"Ceil had questioned her own importance in what is to come, citing her lack of ability, but if Sammy heard Ephora correctly, Ceil was more important than both Chloe and Justin to the approaching calamity."
0,"“They broke through the wall,” someone yelled from below."
0,"Sammy returned to the railing and saw that the manor guards were in combat with soldiers, falling quickly."
0,"Arrows rained on them from the windows of the buildings, fired by the noble families and servants, but their lack of skill was apparent, and they did little to stop the flood."
0,"“What are we supposed to do,” Sammy screamed at the sprite."
0,“Take Justin and flee the city quickly.
0,Take Ceil with you.
0,You won’t reach Chloe in time to save her.”
0,“But the orphanage…” Tears welled in Sammy’s eyes.
0,"She couldn’t abandon the children to slaughter, and even if she could reach Chloe, Chloe wouldn’t leave them either."
0,“The children will die either way.
0,"By pulling everyone to defend the largest manor, Tolmyur’s commanders believe that Ceil is being protected here."
0,They will search and eliminate everyone.”
0,“I can’t…” Sammy dropped to her knees.
0,"She looked up at Justin, and he shook his head."
0,"“There is no way we could leave,” he affirmed."
0,Ephora sighed.
0,“Archon said the same thing.
0,He told me you wouldn’t leave.
0,"I was prepared to teleport Justin, Chloe, and Ceil away from the city, but he warned that your sudden disappearance from a battle where you play a pivotal role would create too large an interference in our foresight, even if your role is only holding out until your imminent demise.”"
0,“Can you take the children away?” 
0,"Sammy jumped to her feet, nearly slamming her face into the small transparent body."
0,“Can you?”
0,“Perhaps…” Ephora vanished without giving an affirmation.
0,“Where’d she go?
0,Ephora!
0,Come back!
0,Are you going to do it or not?!”
1,Sammy raced down the spiral staircase and ran through the manor to the bottom floor and cellar entrance.
0,"She hammered on the thick wooden door, making the children inside cry."
0,They were still there.
0,“What is she doing?
0,We aren’t going to last that long…”
0,"“Sammy?” Justin called out for her, but she did not answer."
0,She rested her forehead on the barricaded door and listened to the faint cries of the children on the other side.
0,“Please…”
0,“I checked with the Arkhon.” 
0,"Sammy spun around and tried to grasp Ephora, but the warm air only flowed through her fingers."
0,“He warned that you might try to grab me… 
0,The sprites gave permission.” 
0,“Really?!”
0,"“The orphans are supposed to die without taking any action of their own, so if we take them away, not only from the city but from civilization, interference should be mitigated, and Gyea should not notice that we are meddling with events."
0,The sprites of Fiorrae have offered to raise them.
0,"They were awfully excited about the prospect, actually.”"
0,“Great!
0,Hurry!” Sammy shouted.
0,“It’s already done.”
0,“What?” Sammy pressed her ear against the door and could no longer hear the cries.
0,All she heard were the panicked voices of the servants and orphanage workers.
0,“All of them?
0,Even those in the other house?”
0,“Even the winged fairy boy hiding in the rafters of the fourth room to the left of the stairwell on the third floor.
0,Now listen.
0,"Every future we see still ends in all your friends’ deaths, but for an unknown reason your existence does not factor into our foresight."
0,"To explain simply, we cannot predict what you do, so if any of them are to survive, it would be from some action you take."
0,You are no longer bound to this location.
0,Flee quickly.
0,"Try to save at least Ceil and Justin, but it may still be too late for Chloe.” "
0,"The sprite vanished, leaving a sinking terror gripping Sammy’s chest."
0,"The children were safe now, but there was no relief."
0,She rapped on the door.
0,“It’s me!”
0,“Lady Sammy?
0,The children are gone!
0,We don’t--”
0,“I took care of them.
0,They’re safe.
0,Spread the word that we need to evacuate to the other side of the ravine quickly before we’re overwhelmed.”
0,Sammy ran out of the kitchen and bumped into Justin.
0,“What’s going on?” he asked.
0,“The children have been taken to Fiorrae.
0,We are evacuating the manor.”
1,Justin followed Sammy out the front door while the servants who were in the cellar spread out to inform everyone holed up with bows in the rooms facing the army.
0,“Lemi!
0,"We’re retreating,” Sammy called up to the roof."
0,"Lemi climbed down without question, and her fellow Melians followed."
0,Sammy turned right at the fountain and headed for the second house.
0,"The door was closed and likely barricaded, so she picked up a rock and threw it at one of the side windows."
0,"“We’re evacuating,” She called through the broken, clouded glass."
0,The head butler showed up almost immediately in a panic.
0,"“Lady Sammy, the children--”"
0,“I know.
0,I took care of them.
0,They’re safe.
0,We need to evacuate before the grounds are overwhelmed.
0,We’ll take the west gate and head south for the fissure.”
0,“Understood.
0,I will tell Lord Olvor.”
0,“Hurry!” 
1,"Sammy rushed diagonally through the garden towards the south gate, pushing her legs onward through her overwhelming exhaustion."
0,"Only one person was on her mind, Chloe, but before she could reach the gate, she saw that the Tolmyur soldiers were already there, had torn down the metal bars, and were engaging the guards."
0,They already passed the road Chloe defended.
0,"All the time she was outside relaying the evacuation order, she had not seen a single explosion."
0,“It may still be too late for Chloe.”
0,"“Damn it!” Sammy reeled internally, but turned back."
0,"“Lemi, tell the servant house we are escaping, but if the soldiers are already there, turn back.”"
0,Lemi ran off without a word.
0,The only comfort Sammy found in sending the young girl to a location much closer to the soldiers was the confident grin on Lemi’s face.
0,"“Let’s go.” Sammy pulled Justin who had only just now caught up, wheezing heavily."
0,“What about… Chloe?”
0,"She shook her head, unable to voice an answer."
0,They could not reach her now.
1,The evacuation of the main and second houses was in full force.
0,The noble families ran with their servants taking the rear in case the soldiers caught up.
0,No one had time to be scared except the children.
0,Children?
0,A few of the noblewomen pulled young children along almost too fast for their small legs to carry them.
0,"Sammy realized then that Ephora had only taken the orphans, not the noble children who were hiding with their parents in the rooms."
0,“Those half-assed pricks!” 
0,Sammy screamed despite knowing that it was only because of the sprites that they were able to evacuate at all and that in her request she only asked that the orphans be saved.
0,"“I couldn’t reach the house,” Lemi called from behind."
0,“Preelen told me to run while she and the servants slow them down.” 
0,That meant that the army had already eliminated all the guards at the east wall.
0,“The soldiers noticed the evacuation too.
0,They’re coming.” 
0,Lemi caught up to Justin and slung his arm over her shoulder so that she could help him run.
0,“Sammy… Can I ask you something?” Lemi spoke up.
0,“What?” Sammy prayed that it would not be something like requesting to stay behind to help everyone else escape.
0,"“If we survive this, can I name my daughter after you?”"
0,Sammy’s heart skipped a beat.
0,"Her hand reached for her mouth to hold back the sobs that tried to break out, but the tears in her eyes flowed unabated."
0,"There was another child she had forgotten about, Lemi’s."
0,I’m so stupid!
0,So fucking stupid!
0,“Sammy?” Lemi’s earnest voice almost sounded as if she was scared that she had somehow insulted Sammy with the request.
0,"“Yes,” Sammy cried."
0,“Thank you… And I’ll name my first daughter after you.”
0,“Really!?”
0," Lemi pranced a few steps, jostling Justin who hung on her shoulder, oblivious to their conversation."
1,Only a few guards stood at the west gate.
0,They quickly ushered the first arrivals through.
0,The servants took point leading them south along the wall.
0,Sammy waited with Justin and Lemi by the gate until most the nobles and servants passed.
0,"A well-aimed arrow struck the back of one of the noblewomen, signaling that their time was up."
0,The soldiers were there.
0,Lemi removed her bow from her back and grew three arrows.
0,She fired them in quick succession.
0,"“Hurry,” she yelled, pushing Justin into Sammy before growing another three arrows."
0,“No! You need to come too!”
0,"Sammy grabbed Lemi’s arm, causing her to shoot the next arrow high into the air."
1,She pulled her and Justin through the gate right before numerous magic attacks and arrows pelted the walls and those who had yet to evacuate the grounds.
0,"Far to the south, a group of soldiers gathered and led the evacuees onward."
0,"The bridge was finished, raising a small glimmer of hope in Sammy’s heart."
0,"When she passed the south corner of the wall, she saw them in open combat with the Tolmyur army."
0,"They were immensely outnumbered, but the elite soldiers who had been posted on the temple grounds were mostly High Elves who held magical superiority over any human, dwarf, and most minums."
0,"They were being pushed back slowly, showing that they would have not been able to break through and save everyone if they had remained in the manor, but their unrestrained barrage of magic without care for their ven levels was buying enough time for everyone to pass."
0,"A stray arrow or magical projectile hit an evacuee every few seconds, sending out sprays of blood and propagating the cries of fear."
0,"Justin pulled Sammy’s shoulder back before an arrow grazed past her nose, the fletching nicking the tip with a sting like a paper cut."
0,"All the while, Lemi grew more arrows and fired them while running."
0,"Sammy wondered how good the girl’s aim could be in such a hurried flight, but with the density of the enemy army, she did not need to be accurate."
0,She only needed to avoid hitting the High Elves who were struggling so desperately to save them.
0,"“Look,” Justin called."
0,The road seemed to disappear about two hundred yards ahead.
0,"The entire section of the district was at a slant beyond the fissure, so the continuing road was far lower in elevation."
0,"The evacuees were not stopping, seemingly running off the cliff, so the bridge had to be there."
0,“Pull back!
0,Retreat!” Sammy heard Dharin yell from somewhere above her.
0,"She looked back and saw soldiers gaining on the last stragglers at the back of the line, and having seen the number that still had to pass through the west gate, she knew that many did not make it."
0,The elite soldiers moved quickly to cut off the pursuers.
0,Lemi reached the fissure first and extended her hand to Justin.
0,The bridge was a shallow ramp that declined about thirty feet over the fissure which was far larger and deeper than Sammy expected.
0,"In the dark, she couldn’t see the bottom."
0,It extended west until it reached the severed curtain wall and east past the north side of the temple grounds.
0,The massive vines coiled up and jutted out at a few locations along its course as if they were holding the fissure open.
0,"She had seen some of the damage around the city from the main house’s third floor and rooftop, but being this close, it felt impossible that this could have been caused by some magic."
1,"At the end of the ramp bridge, Soldiers moved Sammy through the thick defensive line until a slender arm reached out and grabbed her."
0,"“Sammy!” Ceil pulled Sammy into a hug, her tattered jack scraping against Sammy’s bare stomach and arms."
0,She was happy to see Lemi and thanked Justin for bringing her back safely.
0,"She waited for a moment, but there was one person she couldn’t find."
0,“Where’s Chloe?”
0,"“We couldn’t get to her…” Sammy said, her expression dolorous."
0,Ceil’s lips quivered.
0,“And the children?” 
0,"A number of children had made it to safety with their parents, but Ceil knew how many orphans were at Lord Olvor’s manor."
0,She feared for the worst.
0,“The sprites took the orphans to Fiorrae so we could escape.”
0,“I am… I put you through all this.
0,And even Chloe…” Ceil gripped Sammy’s arms and fought to hold back from crying.
0,“It’s not your fault.”
0,“Yes it is!” 
0,"“It’s not,” Justin affirmed."
0,“We knew what we were getting into when we chose to stay.”
0,“But none of this would have happened if it wasn’t for…” 
0,A fireball hit the bank atop the other side of the ravine.
0,"A few soldiers rushed down the bridge, but many others were forced to the edge only to be pushed off by the mass of Tolmyur’s army."
0,A few wind mages propelled themselves over the fissure to be caught by their fellow soldiers on the other side.
0,"Some tried to jump, but none could clear the gap, falling into the dark."
0,"Magic and arrows fired from both sides, and Ceil was pulled with Sammy, Justin, and Lemi to the back of the defensive line."
0,"Thanysa was among the last of Revlan’s soldiers to reach the bridge, and when the army began running down it, she struck it with her fist."
0,"It cracked, and despite one human mage’s attempt to fortify it with his own earth magic, the bridge broke under its weight and crumbled into the fissure, taking Thanysa and no fewer than twenty of both Tolmyur and Revlan soldiers with it."
0,The other side of the ravine quickly filled with enemies along its breadth.
0,"There were hundreds upon hundreds of them, and everyone knew that there were thousands more behind."
0,"Revlan’s soldiers were eclipsed, and everyone felt as if a dangerous predator was staring down at them from its perch."
0,Both sides attacked with whatever ranged abilities were available to them.
0,"The power was on Revlan’s side, but the sheer numbers were on Tolmyur’s."
0,"Ven would run dry before a fraction of the enemy army was defeated, and while Revlan could only attack the enemy soldiers at the edge, every Revlan soldier was in sight."
0,Everyone dies…
0,Sammy cowered under the shields that covered her and her friends.
0,"Ephora said that only she could lead them to victory, but that was impossible."
0,It had to be.
0,Sammy had no military training.
0,She knew nothing of tactics.
0,She even hated playing strategy games like chess.
0,There was no way out.
0,The barrage would continue until all of them were dead.
1,“CEASE FIRE!”
0,"A terrifyingly deep voice enhanced through wind magic echoed over the battle, and slowly the barrage grew to a halt."
0,The shields covering Sammy were lifted.
0,"At the edge of the fissure, a giant taller than most stood with grandeur before the Revlan resistance."
0,"A familiar minum appeared from between the legs of the soldiers beside him, Byurk."
0,"“Empress Ceil,” Byurk called, “I offer you again my mercy."
0,Turn yourself over to us and we will spare this city!”
0,Revlan’s soldiers hollered curses and rebuke at the minum’s offer.
0,Sammy looked beside her and saw Ceil shaking.
0,"“No,” Sammy said, holding onto Ceil’s arm."
0,"“You go to them, and you’re dead.”"
0,"“But if I stay, we are all dead…” Ceil whispered."
0,“Still being stubborn?” Byurk called.
0,“How about a trade?”
0,The soldiers parted and two dwarves stepped forward.
0,"Their arms were alight with flame, and in their grasp was an orange-haired woman."
0,"Her face was bruised and battered with heavy, viscous blood dripping from her nose and mouth down the fissure they hung her over."
0,Two spears were pointed at her neck from behind.
0,“Chloe!” Ceil pushed her way through the soldiers to the edge of the fissure.
0,"“Not again,” she cried."
0,"This was a repeat of Melia, but instead of Justin, Chloe was being held ransom for Byurk’s deal; only this time, the opposing sides were not equal, and the decision could not be postponed to a later date and place."
0,"This was the last battle, the final offer."
0,"“Ceil, you can’t,” Sammy pleaded in English."
0,“But Chloe’s only in that position because of me.
0,Dharin was right.
0,I relied too heavily on her strength.
0,I kept sacrificing her so I could survive longer.”
0,"“We are not willing to bargain,” Dharin replied, hovering in the air above his soldiers."
0,"“You are not the one with whom I am bargaining, fairy,” Byurk rebuked."
0,Ceil took a step forward.
0,"“This deal isn’t going to work,” Sammy pleaded, blocking Ceil with her arm."
0,"“The sprites said that we all die, so of course this is not going to work.”"
0,“Then what does it matter?
0,"Even if there is a chance, is it not better I die and save the city than refuse and die anyway with the rest of Revlan?”"
0,"Sammy bit her lip so hard she felt it split between her teeth, the faint taste of iron spreading over her tongue."
0,She looked around for a way out or any inspiration.
0,"She was the one who had to save the situation, but she just couldn’t see it."
0,The city was in ruins.
0,The walls were destroyed.
0,The citizens were too busy recovering themselves and saving each other after the vines’ destruction.
0,"With the east side of the central district gone, even if there were reinforcements, the steps leading to the curtain wall gate and the gate itself were gone with it."
0,No one could come to their aid without taking the same path the Tolmyur army had.
0,Sammy was about to give up hope until she saw the faint silhouette of a large bird perched in the darkness atop the ruins of the temple.
0,Coby?
0,Where the hell have you been all this time?!
0,“My life for Chloe and the remaining people of Revlan.
0,"No, all of Vallen."
0,Do we have a deal?” Ceil called.
0,Angry shouts from Revlan battled cheers from Tolmyur.
0,"“Agreeable terms,” Byurk replied."
0,The soldiers behind Ceil called for her to reconsider.
0,"“I have made my decision, and as your Empress, I order you not to stop me…."
0,I am doing this for all of you…”
0,Byurk kicked his heel into the ground.
0,A thin platform jutted out from the cliff level with Ceil’s side of the ravine.
0,"The loss of earth used to create the platform destabilized some of the soil, causing a small cascade that startled the soldiers nearest the edge, but none of them fell."
0,“I assume you can climb?” he asked.
0,“Easily.” Ceil stepped one foot on the dark brown stone to assess its strength.
0,“I assure you it is secure.
0,We do not want you falling.
0,We need your body to show Commanding General Jethro.”
0,"Sammy grabbed Ceil’s hand, but Ceil shook it off."
0,“Please… let me do this.”
0,“No!” Sammy protested.
0,“I order you to let me do this!” Ceil’s shoulders quivered.
0,"Sammy’s hand extended, but although Ceil was only a step beyond reach, now two steps, Sammy could not grasp her."
0,Her hand grew to a fist.
0,She looked over toward the temple.
0,"Coby’s head was turned towards them, watching."
0,“Coby!” 
0,The large bird flapped its wings upon hearing his name.
0,“Grab Ceil and take her away from here!” 
0,Her trusted pet responded.
0,Ceil turned toward Sammy in wide-eyed anger.
0,“No!”
0,“I am not your subject!
0,I am your friend!
0,You cannot order me!”
0,"Among everyone Sammy held dear, there were only two who were light enough for Coby to carry, Lemi and Ceil."
0,Lemi was pregnant with a girl who would bear Sammy’s name.
0,"By every instinct, Sammy knew Lemi should be saved, but she couldn’t."
0,"At least one must survive between Justin, Chloe, and Ceil, and the only one of those three that Coby could carry was Ceil."
0,"And if she understood Ephora correctly, Ceil at least must be saved."
0,"Sammy’s order in English to Coby was not understood by the Tolmyur army, but Byurk noticed the large hawk diving."
0,“Kill the Habha!
0,Quickly!”
0,"Before the first arrow could fire, Chloe heard Sammy’s order, and with the last of her waning strength, she erupted in fire, killing the soldiers behind her and creating a cascade of soldiers that sent many falling into the fissure."
0,"The heat of the blast was too much even for the dwarven fire mages, so they thrust her forward."
0,"Coby’s talons reached Ceil’s arms amid the chaos, and with a strong flap of his massive wings, he shot into the air with a cry."
0,The arrows that fired after him were too slow to catch his rapid ascent.
0,“Go!
0,Go!” Sammy screamed with waving arms.
0,"Bregon, protected from most of Chloe’s blast by his thick plate armor and the soldiers between them, grabbed the nearest spear and hurled it."
0,Justin broke from between the soldiers beside Sammy.
0,"He tried to reach her, but the spear thrown by the giant was faster."
0,Sammy felt it tear through her left breast and out her back the moment Justin grabbed her.
0,"A simple thought crossed Sammy’s mind in the sudden, immense pain."
0,Maybe the reason the sprites could not see me in the future was because I was not there.
0,"She apologized to Justin and Lemi in her heart and prayed that she would be able to see them together with Chloe when they shortly followed her to the afterlife, if such a place even existed at all."
1,Ceil watched Chloe fall into the fissure in a blaze and the giant impale Sammy with a single powerfully thrown spear.
0,“No!
0,No!
0,Not again…” 
0,The tears that Ceil constantly fought every day to hold back flowed from her eyes and blew away in the overpowering wind.
0,First it was the night of the assassinations in the Amelian palace.
0,Next it was the attack on the Gallanvale.
0,"Now during the fall of Revlan, it happened again."
0,"“I do not want to be the only one who survives,” she cried as the rapid ascent lightened her head until she passed out."
0,"Chapter 23
“The Survivors”"
1,"Flowers of purple and blue, red and orange, and a myriad of other colors floated through the air on a soft breeze carried by gentle songs of loving comfort."
0,The petals drew pictures of animals and scenery in the sky like a stage play orchestrated by Mother Nature.
0,"The terrified cries of the children slowly ceased, but the confusion and fear in a child’s mind was often difficult to abate, especially when their cries were propagated by many other children who were too scared not to follow along with the chorus."
0,"The worst of the children were cradled atop warm wind that rocked them like a loving mother, and the few of them with keen senses beyond their years recovered quickly after discovering that they were not alone in this idyllic forest garden."
0,There were tiny people at play moving the flowers and singing the songs.
0,They wiped the tears from the children’s faces and kissed their cheeks and foreheads.
0,They brought sweet fruit and mild nectar for the children to eat and drink.
0,"None of the children knew how they got here, but they were protected."
0,"“Thank you,” one boy said to the tiny silhouette of a man who handed him a small cup of warm nectar."
0,"“My, how polite."
0,"You are welcome, young one,” the Arkhon replied."
0,“You should put your wings away before they tire you.
0,You will not need to flee from here.
0,You are safe.”
0,"“Thank you,” the boy said again, dispersing his translucent feathered wings."
0,The Arkhon tousled the fairy boy’s bangs and drifted off towards what had once been Ceil’s hut.
0,Now a small village spread before him with plentiful rooms and beds for the 308 children rescued from Revlan.
0,"It rose almost instantly after all the sprites of Fiorrae learned of Sammy’s proposal, that they would receive the orphans."
0,"To them it was a festival, one that would continue for years as they watched the children grow, become lovers, and then start families with children of their own."
0,"“What if Gyea gets wind of this,” Ephora asked, a sprite the Arkhon had tasked with monitoring Sammy in his place, one that he had been with on Whinhlem from the beginning while many others came and went."
0,“She cannot be angry at us for it.”
0,“Did she not summon you because she suspected that we are taking action without her knowledge?” 
0,"“That was certainly part of it,” the Arkhon laughed."
0,“That is why I requested the speaker on Earth to send those three here instead of us bringing them.
0,"Interference from other worlds is much harder to detect, and Kalya is far more lenient despite her temper."
0,"In any case, Gyea is the one who gave us permission to use her world as a sanctuary."
0,We can live as one of the races but cannot interfere with the progress of her world.
0,I say taking care of children is well within our freedoms.”
0,“Elf and fairy biology is not accustomed to Fiorrae.
0,Have you considered what effect raising children in such a ven-rich environment might have on them?
0,"You exiled Ceil for that very reason, did you not?”"
0,"“I exiled her because it was her time, but I do not deny the harm our land might have caused her if she stayed too long."
0,Young children are different.
0,"They are growing, and their bodies are adaptable."
0,They should be fine so long as we monitor them.
0,"Looking at everyone else, you might be the only one worried on that point."
0,"Now that the village is finished, I think we should begin the discussion.”"
0,“Discussion?” 
0,"“Of what title to bestow upon Sammy,” the Arkhon exclaimed with an aerial cartwheel."
0,"The nearby Sprites who heard the Arkhon’s announcement gathered in anticipation, and word quickly spread to those who were not comforting the children."
0,Soon a commotion was rising in the new village just as loud as the children in the nearby flowered grove.
0,“What good would giving her a title do now?” Ephora asked.
0,“To show respect?
0,I did promise to give her a reward if she shook things up a bit.”
0,“You did what?!”
0, Ephora grew wide-eyed with disbelief.
0,“Sammy’s quick thinking did set the events mostly back on course.
0,"Ceil will supplicate Bydrofe as originally foreseen,” the Arkhon continued, ignoring his partner’s outburst."
0,“Being the speaker on Whinhlem does not give you the authority to act without consulting the rest of us.
0,Your invisible girl has already caused enough trouble.
0,"The kissiae, and especially Keeya, were not supposed to be part of this, and we are still scrambling to see how much her involvement will change the course of events.”"
0,“Sammy being unseen in our foresight is the most important reason that she deserves a title.
0,There is no telling how far her ripple of distortion will continue to spread.
0,Keeya may only be the beginning.”
0,"The face glaring at the Arkhon froze in shock, and Ephora immediately vanished, returning to Revlan."
0,"“Now, any ideas for Sammy’s title,” the Arkhon asked, turning to the excited gathering."
1,"* * *
“Evacuate Her Highness’s companions quickly!"
0,Take them to the Melians!”
0,Swift hands pushed Justin through the crowd of soldiers fast enough to nearly lift his heavy feet off the fractured streets.
0,Arrows and bolts of magic flew overhead as the battle that had halted for one final attempt to negotiate surrender continued with even greater ferocity.
0,"“Careful with her,” Justin screamed not caring that no one could understand him."
0,The soldiers passed Sammy beside him with her blood draining quickly along the wood protruding from her back.
0,He knew it but could not accept it.
0,"The spear had been instantly fatal, and life magic could not raise the dead."
0,"He cursed himself, wishing it had been him."
0,He controlled time.
0,His time magic had saved Sammy once before.
0,He caught a bullet for her.
0,Why now could he not catch a spear?
0,The answer was simple: he had noticed too late.
0,Justin could willfully slow time now.
0,He had when Jethro tried to shoot Sammy and again when Byurk tried to impale Ceil during the meeting of commanders.
0,"But this time, his eyes were on Ceil flying into the sky in Coby’s talons, not on the enemy or Sammy."
0,"Protecting Sammy was his duty, and he failed."
1,A Mountain Elf retrieved Sammy and ran with her to the southern wall of the inner district near Dharin’s estate.
0,Justin fought to keep pace with Lemi’s help.
0,Kiri flew in from overhead and called the two Melians from the garden.
0,Tae aided Tyree as she hopped as fast as she could on her single leg to meet them at the gate.
0,"The Mountain Elf held Sammy before Tyree, not letting the spear touch the ground."
0,Justin arrived just as Tyree placed her hand on Sammy’s forehead.
0,"Her head shook slowly, and Justin collapsed to his knees barely able to voice his sorrow due to the shortness of his breath."
0,"“Do something,” he wheezed."
0,“Do anything.” 
0,His lip quivered as he looked up at Tyree with tears streaming from his eyes.
0,"“Please,” he begged in Elven."
0,"“Help, please.”"
0,Tyree knelt in front of Justin.
0,"“Her heart is destroyed, carved away by the spear."
0,"I can heal, but I cannot regrow a lost organ."
0,Not even a kissiae can perform such a miracle.”
0,Justin did not need to understand Elven to know that Tyree could not help Sammy.
0,"A warm wind enveloped the walkway, and Ephora appeared above Sammy."
0,Justin’s heart skipped at the slight feeling of hope the new appearance brought.
0,“Can you save her?” he nearly screamed.
0,Ephora looked down at Justin with calm eyes.
0,The spear flew out of Sammy’s chest as if yanked by an invisible hand and dropped to the ground.
0,"No blood poured from the wound, having been stemmed by Tyree just moments before."
0,She flitted down and placed her tiny hand on Sammy’s forehead.
0,A small complacent sigh escaped her lips.
0,"Justin’s chest warmed, his hope growing stronger."
0,"“After what the Arkhon said, I had almost thought she survived.”"
0,"Justin’s hope shattered, and his heart broke with it."
0,Her words sounded as if she was glad Sammy died.
0,"“Can you save her,” he asked again."
0,“I will not.
0,Her death is beneficial.”
0,"Justin sprung to his feet and shouted at Ephora, his face no more than a few inches from her."
0,“What do you mean beneficial?!” 
0,Immediately Justin was forced back to the ground by an immense weight that made his joints pop.
0,His head grew faint.
0,Tyree and the other Melians quickly bowed down before the sprite in fear.
0,"The Mountain Elf knelt on one knee, still taking care not to jostle the body in his arms."
0,The power of the sprites was feared by all races of elfkind.
0,Only Kiri remained standing.
0,“Sammy’s actions have already endangered all our preparations.
0,"Because of her, the necessary events preceding the calamity would have fallen into chaos leading to destruction far worse than you can imagine."
0,Her actions in saving Ceil have just barely set events back on course.
0,"Because of Sammy, you all would have died and may yet die here in Revlan, so be grateful that you still breathe, Master of Time."
0,"Instead of mourning her loss, escape the city quickly."
0,You and the Aspect of Destruction are still vital in what is to come.”
0,The weight bearing down on Justin lifted.
0,"He looked up at Ephora with remorseful eyes, begging for any hope this powerful being could give him."
0,“Is there anything I can do with my time magic?
0,"If… if I get better at it, can I go back and save her?” "
0,"Ephora met his gaze, and for a moment her eyes grew apologetic."
0,"She shook her head and flew over to Sammy, sitting on her forehead and caressing her gently."
0,“Time is a constant stream.
0,"You can speed it up to incredible lengths or slow it down enough to be imperceptible, but you cannot stop it, and you cannot reverse its course."
0,Such is unnatural.
0,"To try is taboo, and you will be punished by natural consequence."
0,"Sammy is gone,” she said, this time in a comforting tone."
0,“Her heart is damaged beyond repair.” 
0,"“What about a heart transplant,” Justin asked in desperation."
0,"He would not, could not give up on Sammy."
0,"“Life magic can do that, right?"
0,Earth can do it without life magic.
0,I have seen someone’s side carved out heal like new.
0,It should be easy for you.” 
0,"“Whose heart would you use,” Ephora replied promptly."
0,"“You are the only human from Earth here, and you are incompatible."
0,"Even if you were, you are needed alive."
0,Sammy saved Ceil at the cost of her life.
0,Ceil has fled north.
0,Join her and protect her in Sammy’s stead.
0,That is what Sammy would want.” 
0,Ephora turned to Kiri.
0,“Take Justin from Revlan by force if necessary and pursue Ceil.
0,She is headed for the wilderlands.
0,"Quickly, before the battle reaches you or Ceil is lost.”"
0,Kiri bowed her head.
0,“As you wish.”
0,Justin watched Sammy’s body vanish from the Mountain Elf’s arms.
0,"If her body remained in Revlan, Ephora knew Justin would stay."
0,"She apologized to his dead eyes one final time before leaving, not wanting to hear his wailing cries that would soon follow."
1,"* * *
“Get away from me!” A terrified fairy drove his knife into the abdomen of a dark-skinned dryad as she knelt over him to treat his arm crushed by the rubble of the crumbling wall."
0,"Her life sap slowly leaked from the wound onto the blade and hand that gripped it with fear and ire, but she did not grow angry."
0,"“Sorry,” she said with remorseful eyes."
0,Her apology was not for the dryads’ betrayal of their former ally but for the severity of the damage to the fairy’s arm.
0,It could not be healed.
0,It would need to be amputated.
0,"She cut the circulation to the arm to prevent the rot of his dead flesh from spreading and stood to find a sword, letting the blade slide out of her smooth skin."
0,"Not a moment later, her wound sealed shut."
0,"“Ignore him,” a faint voice spoke."
0,“I need help.”
0,The dryad looked to her side down the pile of stone that had once been part of Revlan’s eastern wall and saw a Forest Elf with a spear protruding from his side.
0,"She rushed down the rubble, nearly tripping over a loose stone, and knelt beside him."
0,"The spear belonged to Revlan, not Tolmyur or the dryads."
0,He was not attacked from behind.
0,"He must have fallen from the wall that even now leaned over the rubble, only held back from full collapse by the trees gripping it with their branches on the far side."
0,“It’s stuck in the rubble.
0,I cannot move.”
0,She placed her hand on the haft.
0,The spears were crafted fresh from the nearby forests for the battle.
0,A little life remained in the wood.
0,"Trivial life magic made the wood brittle just above where it entered his side, and she snapped it off with a swift tug, removing it."
0,The man hissed out a groan but thanked her and sat up.
0,“Do not move.
0,I can only perform emergency treatment.
0,Most the dryads fled.
0,There are not enough of us to help all the injured.”
0,"“No, heal me the best you can."
0,I must return to Lady Chloe.”
0,The dryad placed her hands over both the entry and exit wound.
0,“That would deprive many others of treatment that could save their life.”
0,Benab grabbed the dryad’s arm.
0,“I am not being selfish.
0,"I am the sole surviving guard of Her Highness Empress Ceil’s companion, Lady Chloe Hearn."
0,She was evacuated to the inner city when the kissiae attacked our tower shortly before the vines appeared.
0,I can hear the battle raging in the city.
0,The other soldiers would agree.
0,I must go to her!”
0,"“Do it,” ordered a stout fairy slouched in the rubble only a few feet away."
0,His hands dug in and pulled out a thin Tolmyurin sword nearly his height in length.
0,He needed both hands to stable it in his grip.
0,“I will join you.
0,We will gather all who are able on our way to the inner city.
0,We must drive out the Tolmyur filth and protect her Highness and her companions.”
0,The dryad obeyed with reluctance.
0,"“Your wound should not hinder you now, but know that it is not fully healed.”"
0,“That is enough.
0,You have my thanks.” 
0,"Benab jumped down the rubble and ran beside the fairy, signaling all who were able to follow."
0,Entering the city was simple.
0,The massive vines had broken through the large wall with ease sending large sections cascading into the sunken city.
0,Benab did not want to think about how many were crushed under the rubble.
0,The city was packed to bursting with almost no room to walk.
0,There would have been little room to flee.
0,"He ignored the injured and pleading, only calling to those who were healthy to join him."
1,"* * *
The roar of battle between the soldiers of Tolmyur and the final fairy resistance of Revlan echoed down the deep fissure becoming no more than unrecognizable noise buzzing in Thanysa’s ears."
0,The flashes of light from the fire magic cast over the fissure between opposing forces were brief and insufficient to fully break the darkness.
0,"There had been light for a moment when a flaming body fell into the earthen cavity at the beginning of the battle, but that fire had been extinguished."
0,Thanysa could not let it burn.
0,By chance she had recognized the form of a familiar woman falling in flames and pulverized the cliff-side into fine powder with interspersed pockets of air underneath to cushion the body.
0,The body rolled down the powder as the pockets collapsed until it slid into the muddy and frigid water that slowly filled the bottom of the fissure from the underground streams.
0,Hot steam filled the crevice and soaked Thanysa’s leather armor with both water and sweat.
0,Most of the other soldiers who fell with Thanysa when she destroyed the bridge across the fissure died from the fall.
0,"The only other survivor was an earth mage, a human soldier that cursed her before she beheaded him."
0,"“You will rot in this grave with us, troll.”"
0,Thanysa pulled the steaming body from the mud and laid her beside the beheaded soldier.
0,"The young woman, Lady Chloe, had the luck of the gods."
0,"Thanysa and that soldier had survived the fall due to their reinforcement magic, but Chloe would have surely died like the others if Thanysa had not tripped back to avoid the stone spike the soldier conjured below her feet as she beheaded him."
0,She never would have remained on her back exhausted from the fall and the earth ven conversion required to save her from its impact.
0,She never would have stared at the approaching flame and noticed who it was that burned.
0,Twice now Thanysa had seen Chloe fall victim to the power of her own flame.
0,"Fire mages are skilled a manipulating heat, their body heat being the source of their power and the fuel for ven conversion."
0,"Thanysa was not a fire mage, but about a fourth of all Mountain Elves were, the rest being earth mages."
0,"Before any child is taught to conjure their first flame, they are first taught to regulate their body heat."
0,"Converting fire ven naturally heats the body, and if that heat is not controlled, it could harm the user."
0,"The rare few known as flame-skins were highly resistant to the increase of their body heat, enabling them to endure temperatures high enough to burn others on contact without conjuring a flame."
0,"Chloe was certainly one of these rare few among fire mages, but even she was unable to fully resist the strength of her own flame."
0,"She was powerful, but that power came at a price."
0,Thanysa shielded her face from another body splashing into the ever-rising mud.
0,She needed to rescue Chloe from the fissure.
0,"The mud eroded the loose soil, filling the floor of the fissure and slowly burying the dead bodies that continued to fall from the conflict above."
0,"Chloe was half submerged in the frigid mud again, but there was no more steam."
0,Her body was cold enough to carry now.
0,The issue was her unnatural weight.
0,Thanysa could never hope to climb the deep fissure carrying one who weighed twice her.
0,She did not have enough ven remaining to lift them to the surface with earth magic.
0,"She could only follow the fissure wherever it led, praying to her ancestors that the eroding earthen walls would not collapse around her."
0,"The fissure carved through the central district of the city, barely missing the Temple of the Gods as it meandered eastward."
0,"The thick mud rose slowly, at first up to Thanysa’s ankles but now to her knees."
0,Any attempt to harden the earth beneath her to improve her footing or raise her above the mud momentarily gained her no more than a few inches of height until the heavy earth sank down just as deep as or deeper than before.
0,The combined weight of Chloe and her was too heavy for the soft mud.
0,Thanysa could only harden the walls of earth beside her to prevent them from eroding away and thickening the rising mud.
0,"At the same time, she could not carve away at the walls to help fill the crevice with earth allowing her to walk on dry soil without fear of the loosening soil cascading down and burying them alive."
0,"“Ancestors help us,” Thanysa groaned."
1,The fissure bent to the right where one of the massive vines that dug deep into the fissure wedged overhead as if holding the fissure open.
0,"It was far too high to reach, and its shadow blocked what little light filtered from the surface."
0,"Mountain Elves could see well in the dark, but only if there was at least some faint light."
0,"Here there was none, only a dark muddy passageway underneath the massive vine."
0,"Thanysa continued with Chloe on her back, the frigid mud now up to her thighs."
0,"Deep into the dark, Thanysa bumped her head."
0,"The vine dipped low, and she feared that it would lower further giving her no passage out."
0,She conjured a blade and struck the vine.
0,It was hard and wooden.
0,"She would be unable to carve through it, and she certainly could not climb it."
0,The mud now rose past her waist.
0,"She knelt down, chest-deep into the mud and continued onward with one hand grasping Chloe’s arms across her chest and the other raised to touch the vine to guide her."
0,The mud deepened and the vine lowered still.
0,"Now only their heads remained above the thick mud, each movement agonizing under the pressure."
0,She could feel Chloe growing hot on her back.
0,"When in danger, the body of those with a strong connection to their ven converts its ven to its dominant element to aid survival."
0,"If Chloe grew too hot, Thanysa would be unable to carry her."
0,"At least the mud was regulating much of the heat, but her back stung."
0,Should I turn back?
0,"Thanysa realized that if she continued any further, they would be in danger."
0,Perhaps the vine reached the bottom of the fissure and there was no passage.
0,The mud was still rising.
0,"If she turned back, it would rise far above her head before she could travel to the far side of the central district to exit on the lower levels of the city, if it even reached that far."
0,A vine might even impede her passage there as well.
0,She dug her hand into the earthen wall to sense the structure further east down the fissure.
0,"If there was no exit, if the vine dug down into the soil, they would not be able to escape, at least not together."
0,"If Thanysa wanted to live and be of help to those still fighting above, she would have to leave Chloe here, condemning her to death."
0,Thanysa could not sense too far through the soil.
0,"Her proficiency in earth magic was the same as her mother--conjuration, not manipulation, although she could employ both--so her ability to feel the structure of the earth was limited."
0,The soil and rock hugged the massive vine on the sides.
0,She could not pass beside it.
0,"The mud was thick and deep beneath, but not solid."
0,Passage under was possible.
0,But how far?
0,She was not a life mage.
0,She could not sense if the vine rose at any point or how long she would need to remain submerged in the mud.
0,The only hope she felt was that the walls of the fissure did not hold strong the shape of the vine further down.
0,Perhaps the fissure grew wider or the vine rose.
0,"Or perhaps the mud was deeper there, making sensing the shape of the earth difficult."
0,"Risk diving into the mud, or abandon Chloe and climb to safety on her own."
0,Those were her choices.
1,"* * *
Benab led his rallied soldiers down to the second tier of the city."
0,"The civilians desperately trying to unbury their friends, family, and anyone they could find quickly moved out of their way."
0,"The bottom tier of the city was flooding with mud, but those below the bridges and walkways continued their desperate rescues until the mud grew too high for fairies, forcing many to flee to the second tier."
0,"“Do you see a way up,” Benab called to a fairy flying above."
0,"Its wings were dim, showing the exhaustion of the small figure."
0,"“We could possibly climb the section of the central district that broke off,” a High Elf suggested."
0,"“Impossible,” the flying fairy called back from above."
0,“The fissure at the top is too wide.”
0,Benab looked behind him at the forty or so soldiers.
0,"There were only six High Elves, but that might be enough."
0,“Can we use the vines?
0,Who of you can use dryadic magic?”
0,One of the High Elves looked up the collapsed and crumbling section of the central district.
0,A vine slithered from the outer wall down the tiers to the bottom tier of the city before entering where the fissure extended through the collapsed district.
0,Further in the distance it protruded from the top near the Temple of the Gods.
0,They could enter atop the vine from the fissure and continue along it until the vine rose.
0,"A life mage would not need to manipulate the vine, only grow holds for everyone to climb."
0,"“I can,” the High Elf called."
0,"“As can I,” spoke another."
0,"“And I,” the stout fairy carrying the Tolmyurin blade added."
0,Benab was not expecting a fairy to be proficient in dryadic magic.
0,"“Shey, fly back and recruit one of the dryads if possible,” ordered the fairy commander, and their sole flying fairy took off for the outer walls."
0,“We have no time to waste.
0,We will climb the vines.”
1,Benab ran ahead of the group along the outer walk of the second tier.
0,The bottom tier of the city was another thirty yards below and filling with water.
0,"The collapsed central district that spilled into the bottom tier muddied it, making it difficult to gauge the depth."
0,"The vine entered the fissure from the bottom tier, and it appeared safer to climb atop it using the rubble there than descend onto it from the second tier."
0,“Smoke?
0,"No, steam?” Benab spoke, quizzically."
0,"Below the vine, mud bubbled up releasing steam."
0,"“Are there geothermal veins below this city,” he asked to those close behind him."
0,“None.
0,You would need to go far west of Fiorrae or far north into the wilderlands to encounter any hot springs or geysers.”
0,"Benab hastened down the long steps to the first tier and the base of the vine, ready to climb."
0,The bubbling mud about his waist was hot.
0,He stopped with his hand rested on the vine.
0,"Those behind him rushed past, climbing the rubble and crumbled stone."
0,A body surfaced from the boiling mud.
0,The heat radiating from it stung Benab’s legs.
0,The woman was caked with so much mud that her form was nearly unrecognizable.
0,A suspicion crept into his mind that he could not ignore.
0,"He pulled the heavy body to himself and out of the mud, ignoring the sting."
0,"He once felt heat far worse than now, causing the burn scars all over his body."
0,When he wiped the woman’s face he found his suspicions were true.
0,“By the gods!
0,Lady Chloe!
0,"Life mages, water mages, wind mages!"
0,Hurry!”
0,Benab was about to carry Chloe to the broken steps up to the second tier when a thought came to him.
0,"Chloe was unconscious, but something pushed her from beneath the vine."
0,She would not have been able to do so herself.
0,“Hold her.” 
0,He passed Chloe off to one of the High Elves and dove into the now still mud beneath the vine.
0,He dug down wondering if his intuition had been wrong.
0,"The mud was thick, and his hands could feel little, until there was a hand, then an arm."
0,He pulled but he could not loosen it.
0,He rose for air.
0,“I need help!”
0,Two fairies submerged with him.
0,The mud cleared from the water magic of one while the other helped him grip the arm.
0,"The flow of water helped loosen the body, and Benab pulled her to the surface."
0,It was a Mountain Elf.
0,"The skin of her face and arms was scalded, and like Chloe, she was not breathing."
0,"“Thanysa,” the fairy commander remarked."
0,“What chaos led these two to be buried under the vines?
0,"Life mages unable to use dryadic magic, remain here."
0,"The rest of you, follow me up the vine!”"
0,"A wind mage, water mage, and four life mages remained behind with Benab."
1,"They carried Chloe and Thanysa to the steps and laid them on the stone, quickly stripping off their chest armor."
0,"“Their lungs are filled with mud,” the High Elf explained."
0,"“Lady Chloe first,” Benab ordered."
0,The fairy water mage flushed Chloe’s mouth out and forced more water into her lungs.
0,He then expelled it to purge the mud.
0,"After repeating three more times, he swapped with the wind mage who forced air into her lungs while the High Elf placed his hand atop her left breast to work her heart."
0,"Once Thanysa’s lungs were purged, the same wind mage placed his hand over her mouth."
0,A second High Elf worked to beat life into her heart.
0,The remaining two life mages aided blood circulation and repaired the lung damage to improve breathing.
0,“Please…” Benab begged the gods with his eyes gripped shut.
0,He did not want to lose Chloe.
0,"She was his charge, and he was unable to save her when she was attacked by the kissiae or join her in the fight in the central district."
0,"He promised to protect her, and here she was again drinking the waters of Ithsa, the putrid river of death."
0,"She had been on its shores once before in Melia, beside him, tasting of the bitter water."
0,He was bound to her.
0,"Now he feared she drank her fill, ready to collapse into Ithsa to be carried away in its current."
0,A cough.
0,"Benab opened his eyes to see Thanysa spit out browned water and reel, but her eyes did not open, too weak to fully wake, but she was alive."
0,His heart beat in anticipation.
0,Surely Chloe would wake next.
0,"“I brought a dryad,” the flying fairy called from above."
0,The same dark-skinned dryad who had helped Benab clung to the arms of the fairy who was just barely managing to keep flight.
0,"“Here, quickly,” Benab waved."
0,The dryad let go of the fairy and fell five yards to land gracefully on the steps.
0,She immediately turned her attention to Thanysa.
0,Benab grabbed her arm and wrenched it towards Chloe.
0,"“Her first,” he ordered."
0,The dryad shook her head.
0,“She is lost.
0,Surely the High Elves here have realized this already.”
0,“Yet still they try.
0,Help her.”
0,"“I cannot raise the dead,” the dryad spoke, showing no emotion."
0,“Cannot or will not?
0,She has not been dead for long.
0,"I know some of your tribes do not aid what has died, but Forest Elves have been resuscitating the recent dead for millennia."
0,It is possible.
0,Help her!”
0,“To try would be a waste.
0,There are others in need of my assistance who are dying as we speak.”
0,Benab drew the blade of the High Elf tending to Thanysa beside him.
0,"“Lady Chloe is a companion of Her Highness, Empress Ceil, and a hero to us all."
0,"I will behead you where you stand if you refuse again, traitor of the empire!”"
0,The dryad looked up at Benab with only pity in her eyes.

“I cannot clear this gap,” the Mountain Elf, Hethyro, said to Kiri."
0,"He had a fire affinity, not earth."
0,He had no way to create a bridge or even launch himself over the fifty-yard crevice between the crumbling road where they stood and the collapsed section of the central district.
0,“Your wings are the only way.”
0,He set Justin down on the cobblestone road.
0,Justin had not moved or spoken since Ephora informed him that Sammy was dead and would not be saved.
0,"Tears slowly built and ran down his cheeks, but he did not cry out his grief."
0,His heart was broken and his voice broken with it.
0,Kiri hooked her arms under his shoulders and grew large feathered wings that shone with a translucent glow.
0,"Her feet kicked off with a light flap, and she struggled to hold him."
0,"Her elevation decreased despite her efforts to stay airborne, but it was enough."
0,The steeply sloped road of the far side was much lower in elevation.
0,She reached it with a few feet to spare.
0,"She set him down against a metal fence fastened into the ground so that he would not slide and returned for Lemi, Tyree, and Tae, the three Melians."
0,"“You next,” she said to Hethyro."
0,“Can you carry me?”
0,“Perhaps without your armor.” 
0,Hethyro removed his plate armor and the leather beneath.
0,"Wearing no more than his trousers, he appeared to shrink by a third his original size."
0,He gripped Kiri’s arms and kicked off as far as he could.
0,He was heavier than Justin by about twice.
0,"Her approach was slow, and he barely had enough reach to grab the ledge above him on the other side."
0,Together they descended the crumbling city.
0,Buildings had collapsed and slid down the side.
0,The curtain wall was nonexistent.
0,"The entire southeastern section of the top tier of the city was buried beneath, and the rubble ran into the second tier, leveling buildings and nearly running off the edge into the bottom tier."
1,Their descent ended atop a single-story structure beside a broken stairway to the flooding bottom tier of the city.
0,There atop the structure they saw the moment a Forest Elf beheaded a dryad.
0,Kiri knew him.
0,“Benab!”
0,"Benab looked up and saw Kiri, Hethyro carrying Justin, and three more Dryads."
0,"“Kiri,” he screamed, “Chloe needs dryad life magic! Quick!”"
0,Lemi jumped off the building and hopped down the steps.
0,She froze before Chloe.
0,"Like the dryad before, Lemi’s life magic told her that Chloe was dead."
0,"“Tyree, you are the only one who can help her,” Lemi shouted as she ran to the base of the building."
0,Tae slowly positioned Tyree to fall into Lemi’s arms.
0,"Lemi collapsed back from the impact, but quickly recovered and led Tyree to Chloe with the help of one of the High Elves."
0,“Impossible.
0,"I saw her fall into the fissure,” Kiri gasped."
0,She landed nearby and dispersed her wings.
0,“Thanysa fell too.
0,Did she…”
0,“Yes.
0,"I am certain Thanysa saved Chloe,” Benab explained."
0,"“She is well and will live, but Chloe--”"
0,"“Dead,” Tyree said flatly."
0,"“I will do what I can, but I make no promise.”"
0,"Justin arrived, hanging over Hethyro’s shoulder."
0,"He saw Chloe motionless and caked in mud on the steps, not breathing."
0,"He struggled and slid off Hethyro, nearly tripping down the steps."
0,He did not dare draw too near.
0,He could do nothing while he watched Tyree work as the seconds passed with no success.
0,He wanted to call out to Ephora for help but hesitated.
0,What if she took Chloe away as she had Sammy?
0,In his mind he remembered Sammy’s warning to Ceil before Ceil offered herself to the Tolmyur soldiers in exchange for their lives.
0,She said that they all would die.
0,Sammy died in front of him.
0,Chloe was dead in front of him now.
0,"Justin was exhausted, physically, mentally, and emotionally."
0,His body ached from his anguish.
0,Justin rose to his feet and walked away down the road to a bridge across the bottom tier before the sight of the death of another of his friends broke his will to move forward.
0,He failed Eydis and did not know if she was dead or alive.
0,He failed Sammy.
0,He failed Chloe.
0,"But, there was another he could still help, another who still lived."
0,Ephora was correct.
0,"Justin had a mission, and focusing on that could help him ignore the pain that threatened to tear him apart."
0,He was not seeking redemption for his failures.
0,He only loathed the thought of losing another.
0,"Lemi called his name from far across the other side of the bridge, but he ignored her."
0,"Next Kiri called his name, but again it fell on deaf ears."
0,She flew to him as he pushed his way through the frantic crowds of fairies and elves struggling to help the injured.
0,"His feet reached the first step up to the top tier of the city, but a small hand grabbed his shoulder."
0,"“Justin,” she called."
0,"“I am going after Ceil,” he said, knowing well Kiri would not understand him."
0,"Kiri jumped in front of him, her face level with his on the steps above."
0,“Chloe lives.”
0,"The short phrase was in Elven, but Justin understood."
0,He turned back to see Lemi waving and jumping excitedly.
0,"“Chloe’s alive,” he repeated as fresh tears fell down his cheeks."
0,"He ran back over the rubble, through the crowd, and across the bridge."
0,Lemi latched onto his arm and pulled him to the steps.
0,"There Chloe lay, her chest rising and falling with weak breaths."
0,"“We escape the city immediately,” Kiri ordered."
0,“We can treat Chloe and Thanysa as we travel.
0,We must pursue Her Highness in the wilderlands.”

1,Screams erupted in the city as people fled in terror.
0,Husbands were forced to abandon their wives and mothers their children as those of slower pace were consumed before their very eyes.
0,"Vines of variegated ivy crawled over every road, wall, and rooftop as fast as the swiftest feet could fly."
0,"Those ensnared shriveled as their life was sucked from their bodies, but they did not die."
0,"The lifeless thralls attacked those who fled, even former loved ones, as if chasing them out of the walls of the city where the growth stopped."
0,"It began from the palace that was once conquered by the Tolmyur army and spread in all directions as a verdant flood that not even fire could abate, the vines seemingly immune."
0,"Where fire was used, the ivy vines retaliated with water magic or amassed to crush the threat."
0,"Any who used magic became targets, forcing all to flee."
0,"There was no hope, no salvation for the captive city of Amel."
1,"Deep in the palace gardens, now unrecognizable from the immense growth of the foliage and the thick ivy that coated every surface, was a coven of thirty-one kissiae, the last of their kind."
0,"All of them but one trembled at the sight of the greatest among them, Keeya, despite her outwardly calm demeanor."
0,"Keeya sat Emer, who was unaffected by the drain of her ivy hair deeply rooted in the ground around them, in the center of the garden and used his arm to hold and caress the sole kissiae child who was left alone and afraid in Elos."
0,The child snuggled up to the warm body as if it was Keeya’s and basked in the attention.
0,"“I am not angry at you,” Keeya said to those who cowered around her."
0,Her voice that had sounded as a child’s now spoke clearly.
0,"The long, long ages of pain and mental anguish that caused her mind to regress had reverted, and her mind regained its vibrancy."
0,"Although her ever-youthful appearance had not changed, the drastic increase in the pressure of her very presence bore down on her fellow kissiae."
0,She was different now than before.
0,Keeya was no longer just a dryad and no longer just a kissiae.
0,"“I am not angry at you,” Keeya repeated."
0,“I am angry at myself.”
0,The young child turned in Emer’s lap to look up into Keeya’s eyes as if asking why.
0,“I was one of the first of the kissiae at a time in ages past where dryads were far longer lived than they are now.
0,"In all my many years I never bore a single child, not one daughter to call my own."
0,"Hamadryads cannot bear children, so when my time came, I resisted."
0,"I fought it through torment until I learned how to stop my roots from growing, but the pain never left."
0,Life became my obsession.
0,I longed for the day I would mother a child that I could hold in my arms as I hold you now.”
0,"Keeya embraced the young girl, making her giggle."
0,“I avoided war.
0,I avoided conflict.
0,"When the races grew fearful of the kissiae, I basked in the safety that fear provided."
0,"When they began to hunt us, I hid, abandoning my kind as our numbers dwindled and the races poached us for our toxins."
0,I hate conflict.
0,I hate fighting.
0,"I want to create life, not end it!”"
0,Keeya gritted her teeth as a tear fell down her cheek.
0,"The kissiae surrounding her cowered once more, but the young child stood in Emer’s lap and wiped away the tear."
0,“Don’t cry…”
0,Keeya embraced the child and lifted her to nuzzle their cheeks together.
0,"“While I hid, the hunting continued until there were only eight of us left."
0,"Kanazee was one of them, only an infant at the time.”"
0,Kanazee hung her head in shame.
0,"As one of the few survivors, she understood that she, more than anyone in Keeya’s absence, should have prioritized the survival of her kind and not sent them into battle."
0,"But the threat of Gyea’s retribution was too dangerous to ignore, its scars forever marking the continent, so even now, she did not regret her decision, only that she failed to kill the trespassers before Keeya intervened."
0,"“The Amelian Empire offered us sanctuary, and I sided with Tolmyur to preserve it without conflict when the empire fell, but now I know that I cannot even trust you to save each other.”"
0,"The kissiae bowed to the ground in apology and supplication for mercy, but Keeya only smiled lovingly."
0,"“All my life I have yearned for a daughter, but as of today, that is no longer possible."
0,"You are now my daughters, and your daughters will be my daughters."
0,I will hide no longer.
0,I will avoid conflict no longer.
0,"To protect my children, I will make the entire world that has wronged us my enemy."
0,"Even if it means angering the gods, I will protect my children.”"
