0,"Collision of Worlds 
Declaration of War Part 3 
By Michael DeBuse"
0,"Chapter 1 
“Kindred” 
Ceil"
1,An unfamiliar chill blew through the white-blanketed mountain pass.
0,"It was colder than Heivleil, Amel, the Gallanvale, Fiorrae, all of Melia, and the flatlands of northwest Vallen, colder than every place that Ceil had the pleasure--or displeasure--of visiting."
0,"The biting cold nipped at Ceil’s exposed cheeks and nose, flushing them pink and making them sting."
0,"She sat at the side of the uneven pass road beside the steep rocky slope of the forested mountain, her knees tucked to her chest and her shaking arms wrapped around them."
0,"Coby set her here after fleeing Revlan at Sammy’s order, right when she was about to surrender herself to Tolmyur to spare what fairies remained and the lives of her friends."
0,"She did not know where she was, only that it was the wilderlands."
0,Nowhere else nearby would be so mountainous and cold.
0,"The trees along the road grew sturdy and broad with thick, spearheaded fronds of scaled needles, shielding her for the most part from the lightly drifting snow, but they could do nothing for the cutting wind."
0,"It howled through the valleys and ravines, accelerating as it swam through the trees."
0,"The wind must have been magic, because the chill it carried pierced her through her plated jack armor and leather skirt."
0,"Ceil was exhausted, but she could not sleep."
0,The brief period of unconsciousness from the rapid ascent of her flight lasted until Coby set her down.
0,"Her dead eyes stared blankly down the pass in the direction of Vallen’s flatlands too far beyond her vision to see, especially in snowfall."
0,Again she survived due to the sacrifice of others.
0,Again she alone lived to spread destruction as Tolmyur hunted her.
0,Why am I resisting them so?
0,To what end is my survival beneficial?
0,"Ceil reached to her side and felt the fractured tip of her staff tucked in her belt, wood from a now deceased Hamadryad."
0,Not only the fairies but also the dryads were drawn into the conflict.
0,She ordered her own subjects to kill their former allies.
0,Subjects?
0,Ceil gritted her teeth.
0,She was no empress.
0,She was not royalty.
0,She was a farm girl of Heivleil on the very northeast border of the Amelian Empire.
0,"She was bought by the emperor as a child, not to be loved but to be hidden away as a tool to produce impure offspring who would never be recognized in royal High Elf society due to her mixed fairy heritage."
0,Prophesy and protection?
0,That meant nothing.
0,Only now did she realize she was not an empress but a concubine who had even failed in that role being unable to bear Emperor Yuro a single child.
0,"To think for a moment that she could take such an important responsibility as succeeding Emperor Yuro, even to the degree of announcing the rise of her own empire in Revlan, was the height of folly."
0,"Her delusions of grandeur led to the destruction of the final fairy city and the deaths of her friends, of Sammy and Chloe."
0,No doubt Lemi and Justin would also die before the conclusion of that hopeless battle.
0,Perhaps they were already dead.
0,"“You were supposed to protect her,” Ceil cursed at Justin’s memory."
1,"A shrill cry sounded from above, and the branches of the tree shielding Ceil rustled."
0,Something no bigger than her hand fell onto the ground in front of her.
0,It lacked odor but was clearly cured meat of some kind.
0,Ceil ignored it.
0,"She had no appetite, nor did she care where Coby happened to find cured meat in the middle of a mountain pass."
0,"Coby dropped down in front of Ceil and lifted the meat in his beak, presenting it to her, but she would not take it."
0,He trilled worriedly through the gap in his beak from holding the meat.
0,Ceil’s eyes fell away from him.
0,She did not want to eat.
0,She was fine with starving or freezing to death here on the pass.
0,Maybe the army would head north in search of her after they finished purging the city of life as they had all the others and discover her corpse by the roadside.
0,Maybe that would finally end the war.
0,Coby set the meat at Ceils feet and trotted behind her.
0,"His wings enveloped her, blocking the piercing wind, and he nuzzled his beak on the side of her head, nipping lightly at her ear."
0,Ceil stifled her cry out of habit as one who was supposed to lead the masses--a leader should never cry--and buried her head deeper into her arms.
0,"Coby was warm, and she felt she did not deserve that warmth."
1,Ceil woke to the crunch of footsteps over snow and gravel.
0,"The snowfall had subsided, but the few more inches covering the road showed it had fallen for most of the morning."
0,A man with a perplexed expression stood in the road.
0,"“That explains the thieving Habha,” he grumbled, rubbing the side of his head."
0,He was about Ceil’s height.
0,His long brown hair was tied back into a long ponytail exposing his rounded ears.
0,Ceil’s eyes opened wide.
0,"“Human…”
Ceil had committed herself to being captured by the humans should they find her, but seeing one alone, she grew apoplectic with rage."
0,"If she could not take her revenge against the army, perhaps she could kill just one."
0,Ceil grabbed the small dagger sheathed at her hip and lunged out from Coby’s wings.
0,"She swung wide, the tip of the dagger missing the man’s neck by a mere inch as he stepped back just enough to avoid it."
0,"“Hold it,” he said, deflecting her next swing with a practiced palm to her forearm."
0,He placed his foot into the small of Ceil’s back and kicked out.
0,She tumbled over the snow collapsing back to the side of the road.
0,Coby cried out and opened his wings in hostility.
0,“Woah!
0,"I mean no harm.” The man crouched with his arms spread out, palms turned away, and head bowed to Coby."
0,"Ceil watched how his strange, submissive posture calmed Coby."
0,This man knew how to appease Habha.
0,"He reached into the snow with one hand, not breaking the rest of his posture, and dug up a stone."
0,"He gripped it in his fist, and it fell through the back of his hand."
0,Ceil stared in amazement.
0,“I have lived in the wilderlands all my life.
0,I am not human.
0,I am an oread.
0,"My name is Zose.”
His hair wasn’t brown as she thought but a dark orange."
0,"Male nymph hair lacked in vibrancy compared to women, especially adults."
0,Ceil sat up and sheathed her dagger.
0,“A male oread?
0,"Shouldn’t you be sire to a village somewhere in Orest?”
Zose extended his hand to Ceil."
0,"She gripped it, and he pulled her to her feet."
0,"“By the grace and wisdom of my mother, I was saved of that fate when she fled the empire after learning she would bear a son.”
“Saved?"
0,Are male nymphs not worshipped?
0,Your kind is so rare.
0,"Only you can produce offspring with other nymphs.”
“That is precisely why the position of sire is a curse."
0,Come.
0,These mountains are dangerous.
0,A Lurr built a nest in the abandoned granite quarry to the west.
0,"It was male.”
A shiver ran down Ceil’s spine stronger than the chill of the air."
0,"Lurr could not reproduce with other Lurr, so they capture species of other races for that purpose."
0,Zose’s mention of the Lurr’s sex was a warning that she was in danger so close to the quarry.
0,"“I killed it, but its spawn might still be around searching, not knowing their broodleader is dead, and your bright purple armor is quite visible in the snow."
0,The beast was a pixy’s tail shy of a Chimera.
0,It was beginning to control its evolution.
0,"No doubt it had captured a handful of fairies in its life to grow so intelligent.” Zose beckoned Ceil to follow, and Coby trotted close behind."
0,“How could you kill a Chimera without magic?” Ceil asked.
0,“I am a hunter mercenary.
0,This is my job here in the wilderlands.
0,I took the request because its nest was a quarry.
0,I am an oread.
0,Infiltrating and killing it from the safety of the stone was simple.”
0,"“But cords of hair cannot kill a Lurr, especially not a Chimera.”"
0,"“You seem to be well acquainted with Lurr but not with nymphs,” Zose smirked, glancing back over his shoulder at Ceil."
0,“I was born in Heivleil at the edge of the empire.
0,"Lurr were always a danger there so close to the wilds, so we were taught about them as children.”"
0,"Zose reached to his thigh and removed a white knife from its sheath, handing it to Ceil."
0,"She inspected it, noticing the porous texture."
0,"“This is bone.”
“My mother’s femur."
0,I have an identical blade on my right.” Zose patted the sheath on his right leg.
0,"“Oreads can take products of themselves with them into stone, and that ability also extends to close relatives, parents or siblings."
0,"When my mother died, I turned her body into as many tools and equipment as was possible.”"
0,"Ceil stopped walking, staring at Zose in horror."
0,The knife fell from her fingers.
0,"His shirt and trousers were clearly woven from his hair, but his leather vest, belt, and shoes were not of a type of leather she had seen before."
0,Zose was undisturbed by Ceil’s reaction.
0,"He walked over to Ceil and retrieved the knife from the snow, placing it back in its sheath after wiping it down."
0,“Life in the wilderlands is often harsh.
0,To not use what resources are available to you is a waste and can lead to death.
0,My mother requested this of me on her deathbed.
0,"It was her decision, although I may have done it anyway without her consent.”"
0,"“If life is so hard in the wilderlands, why did she take you here?"
0,Why not live elsewhere in the empire?”
0,“What do you know of nymph culture?”
0,"“Not much,” Ceil admitted, continuing after Zose."
0,“The sire rules the village and provides seed for the women.
0,Most of the nymph sires were assassinated before Tolmyur invaded.
0,Only the smallest villages avoided it.” Ceil recalled the messages that appeared one after the other when she waited in the fairy council room of the Gallanvale after escaping Amel.
0,“There was a fear that there would be too few sires and that much of the nymph population would die off due to the lack of males being born now that there are not enough to support the number of women.
0,"Sires are protected because of that fear, and it actually happened.”
“Not protected."
0,Imprisoned.
0,My mother was one of the three caretakers for her village sire.
0,"The caretakers run the village, not the sire."
0,The sire’s sole purpose is to produce offspring.
0,That is all.
0,They are not pampered.
0,They are not even educated.
0,Did you know that every oread sire was born to a caretaker?
0,The reason is that they have more access to the sire than the other nymphs.
0,"Due to the drastic difference in numbers, any single nymph may only see the sire once or twice in her lifetime."
0,The caretakers bear as often as they are able.
0,"It is not uncommon for a caretaker to flee once they discover that they bear a son because they know the horrible life he will live, but every sovereign state of the empire had a political agreement with the nymphs to slay the mother for attempted genocide and return the child should they discover them in their territory."
0,This is kept secret from most the general population.
0,"The only state to end this agreement was Vallen, and only recently, after my mother fled to the wilderlands.”"
0,"“With the state of the nymphs after the assassinations, do you ever consider returning?”"
0,“And give up my freedom for the sole purpose of producing offspring?
0,"Never.”
Ceil’s steps slowed."
0,“We are the same… but I did not have a choice.
0,I was sold as a child by my father to nobility for the sole purpose of bearing children.
0,"I was educated, but mostly to rid me of my peasant upbringing."
0,I escaped during… after Tolmyur’s invasion.”
0,“I hear concubinage is alive and well in Vallen although it is outlawed in most of the empire.
0,"They were the most independent of the states under the Amelian Empire, after all.” Zose scratched the side of his head."
0,"“Perhaps for you the invasion was a blessing.”
Ceil tensed."
0,Her hands gripped into tight fists.
0,"She wanted to shout, to rebuke Zose for such a painfully ignorant statement, but instead held her breath until her face grew red."
0,Zose turned and grasped her trembling fist.
0,She shook it free in anger.
0,“That was inappropriate of me.
0,"I do not hold the empire in high regard, but I do not know your circumstances either."
0,"If I insulted you, I apologize."
0,I am headed for Ib’nua.
0,It is three days north from here.
0,"My wife, Basara, will welcome you and your Habha.” Zose nodded to Coby who cried lightly."
0,"“Will you join me?”
Ceil’s rigid fists relaxed."
0,"She had nowhere to go, so she nodded her consent."
0,Chapter 2 “A Hidden History” Ceil
1,"
Ib’nua sat in the first open valley within the Nuanae Range that ran along the northern border of Vallen."
0,"Although Zose called it a valley, multiple rolling hills like uniform mounds crowded together in what appeared to be only a lowland pocket before more steep mountains."
0,"Ib’nua was visible from the mountain pass in the waning daylight, spread between the hills like water filling the creases in the topography."
0,The city was small but still too large to be called a town or village.
0,"Ceil recalled it as a trading hub, the southernmost trade city of the wilderlands."
0,"A traveling merchant that passed through Heivleil for Menneiv, the largest commerce city in the plains of Filinceil, began his route in Ib’nua."
0,"He was the only merchant from the wilderlands to pass through such a small town, especially because Heivleil was a full two day’s walk off the main highway."
0,"The foreign products he carried were a delicacy for her village, and any additional food was welcomed during the long famine of her childhood."
0,Ceil remembered fondly the taste of the sweetbark her mother would buy from him as a treat whenever he arrived through the summer.
0,A small piece could be chewed the entire day without losing its sweetness.
0,"Sadly, sweetbark grew bitter in winter."
0,"“Keep Coby close,” Zose warned."
0,“He is liable to be shot out of the air for his plumage should people see him without knowing he is yours.
0,And it is best to refer to yourself as a tamer to ease others’ worries.
0,"Habha are dangerous, after all, and they do not live in this climate."
0,"Some may scare.”
Ceil called Coby, and he landed beside her, leaning over to nip at her fingers."
0,“If you plan on staying in the wilderlands you should consider registering yourself as a tamer.
0,"I have never seen a domesticated Habha.”
Ceil’s chest tightened."
0,It was not she who tamed him.
0,She scratched lightly the feathers beside Coby’s beak.
0,“Stay close.”
0,“That language you speak to him and he understands--”
0,"“Fiorran, the language of the sprites,” Ceil interrupted."
0,"English, she recalled, causing her chest to tighten further, choking her."
0,“Fiorrae… That explains his size.
0,The Habha in Dhuillir never grow this large.
0,Your situation must have been truly bizarre indeed.”
0,"Over their three-day travel, Ceil refused to elaborate why she had fled to the wilderlands, so Zose stopped asking."
0,Most people who moved to the wilderlands often did so for somber reasons.
0,No one would want to live in a seemingly lawless and hostile land otherwise.
0,"But as the size of Ib’nua could attest, even without formal laws community thrived."
0,"The question still lingered of why Ceil wore such vibrant armor, but if she was a royal Vallen concubine, perhaps that answer could be explained."
0,"Again, Zose did not ask further, especially after seeing Ceil’s distress at Tolmyur’s invasion of Vallen."
0,Ceil kept Coby close to her side as they entered town.
0,The city was bustling despite the drifting snow that was too wet to build on the ground at these lower elevations.
0,The roads were not paved nor were they packed earth.
0,"Passersby--elfkind of almost every race, many of whom were mixed breeds--kicked mud with each step soiling Ceil’s armor and irritating Coby."
0,His cries of frustrations were quickly hushed by Ceil stroking his beak.
0,The people would start but soon ignored the large bird seeing that another held his metaphorical leash.
0,"“I will clean your feathers later,” she promised."
0,Ceil was thankful that everyone kept to themselves.
0,Even those who knew Zose only cast him a glance with a twitch of their eyes being their only greeting.
0,Zose grabbed a thin meat skewer as he passed what looked like an open tavern window and handed it to Ceil.
0,"It was clearly overcooked, reminding her again of Sammy, particularly Sammy’s early attempts to cook as they left Fiorrae for Melia."
0,She hesitated to take it from him.
0,"“Did you just steal that,” she asked, not so much as an accusation but as an honest question."
0,“Food placed in open windows is for those who need it.
0,There are many destitute here.
0,The community takes care of each other.
0,"I cannot expect Basara to feed an unplanned mouth on the day of my return, but do not worry."
0,"We will accommodate you, if you do not mind sleeping in bed with my daughters.”"
0,“The floor is fine enough.
0,"I have Coby for warmth,” Ceil replied with a light shake of her head."
0,“I would hear no end from Basara if I made you sleep on the floor.
0,"She would rather I do and share her bed with you,” Zose chuckled."
0,“You have a good wife…”
0,"“Best in the wilderlands,” Zose boasted with a puffed chest."
0,“Is she also a nymph?”
0,"“Yes, but no."
0,You will understand when you see her.”
0,Zose’s cryptic answer made Ceil’s brows furrow.
0,How could he have daughters if his wife was not a nymph?
0,Only nymphs could reproduce with other nymphs.
0,"Past the first hill, the shabby wooden structures yielded to those built from layered stones."
0,Dress and apparel slightly improved as did the smell.
0,"Here Ceil could stomach nibbling on her skewer, but it lacked any flavor."
0,"The meat had burnt, making it slightly bitter, so it was probably set on the windowsill before wasting any seasoning."
0,Or perhaps there was to be no seasoning at all even if it was properly cooked.
0,She had been spoiled by Dharin during her short time in Revlan without realizing.
0,Her tongue yearned for something with flavor.
0,Coby nipped at Ceil’s hand.
0,"“Fine, you can have some.” She slid half the remaining meat off the whittled stick and passed it to Coby."
0,She then realized that she was now doing the very same that she often scolded Sammy for in the past.
0,Sammy’s feeding of Coby was likely the reason he continued to stay with them.
0,"“Here.” She handed Coby the rest of her skewer, now lacking the appetite for it."
0,"Past the next hill, the structures improved once again."
0,"The flat stones used in the masonry were now carved and mortared, leaving no gaps between."
0,What surprised Ceil the most was the appearance of the same types of ruins she found in Vallen’s flatlands buried partially in the hills.
0,The oddly uniform mounds may have all been ancient ruins of some form.
0,Zose led Ceil to a mortared building.
0,"It seemed he was not wealthy enough or with enough influence to claim a structure repurposed from the ruins, but the building at least could ward off the cold."
0,Only a leather curtain blocked the entrance.
0,Zose held it back for Ceil to enter.
1,Two young girls with vibrant orange hair rushed to the entryway.
0,They were both oreads.
0,"“Zose!”
“Father!”
The youngest looked to be half a year old and the eldest about a year if not a little older."
0,"Zose knelt and embraced his daughters, one in each arm."
0,"“Not until after he’s cleaned up,” a woman rebuked from the entry to another room."
0,"“Now we will have to clean you up too.”
She was fair skinned and beautiful, strangely youthful for a mother of two children of their ages."
0,She appeared no older than Eydis.
0,"Nymphs lived short lives, similar to humans, but kept much of their youth; however, she was not an oread, possibly not even a nymph."
0,"Her hair was red, but it lacked a vibrant hue like a nymph’s should."
0,"The color was dull, like Chloe’s if comparing Chloe’s orange color to an oread’s."
0,"She looked human, but no humans of Whinhlem had pale skin and red hair."
0,Ceil did not know what she was.
0,"Zose walked over to kiss Basara, but she held her fist to his chest preventing him from approaching."
0,“Clean yourself first.”
0,"Ceil, Coby, Zose, and now his two daughters had the mud and filth of the streets on them."
0,"“Let’s take a bath,” the eldest daughter said, pulling Zose’s hand."
0,"The youngest, the only one who seemed to notice Ceil’s presence, grabbed her hand."
0,"“No,” Ceil rejected, “I can wait until you are finished.”"
0,"“Hold,” Basara ordered before Zose could be pulled any further."
0,"“No mud inside.”
The two girls immediately stripped as did Zose."
0,They then passed beside Basara with her nod of approval.
1,Ceil stood alone with Coby in the entryway.
0,"“You too,” Basara said, not questioning who Ceil was, where she came from, or why she was with Zose."
0,“There is enough room for you all.”
0,Ceil did not want to intrude on the family more than needed.
0,"“I am grateful, but I will wait.” "
0,Basara tapped her foot in mild annoyance and then turned into the other room.
0,She quickly reappeared with a stool and a bucket of steaming water.
0,"“Turn your back to me,” she ordered."
0,Ceil expected to be doused with the water but instead felt the ties on her jack being loosed.
0,“I despise jacks.
0,They are too difficult to remove on one’s own.
0,Yours is finely crafted.
0,I assume it was made by a troll?
0,Their stitching is an easy tell.
0,"Turn, arms forward,” she ordered."
0,"Ceil extended her arms, and Basara removed the Jack with precise movements."
0,She was as practiced in doffing armor as Thanysa.
0,Basara noticed Ceil’s surprise.
0,"“I was a veteran hunter mercenary until my first daughter was born, if you were curious."
0,I also fought in the Coastal War in Tolmyur.”
0,Ceil pulled away before Basara could finish untying her leather skirt.
0,“You are human.”
0,“Half.” Basara beckoned Ceil to return and finished removing Ceil’s armor.
0,“Strip and sit on the stool.”
0,Ceil hesitated.
0,She couldn’t trust a half-human just as she couldn’t trust a human.
0,"If Basara fought in the Coastal War, she would have fought on Tolmyur’s side, because only Tolmyur, the Sea Elves, and the merfolk participated in the war."
0,"“Strip,” Basara ordered again, a little more sternly."
0,"“If you must know, I am also half nymph."
0,My mother was a maenad.
0,My father was born in the wilderlands when my pregnant grandmother fled from Tolmyur.”
0,“Like Zose.”
0,“He told you?
0,Yes.
0,"Very similar, although for different reasons."
0,Must I ask you again?”
0,“I can wash myself.
0,I do not want to trouble you.”
0,“Washing away the toils of a visitor’s travels is a form of welcome here.
0,"Had you joined my husband and daughters in the bath, my eldest would have performed the same for you as I am now.”"
0,Ceil removed her bind and untied her underskirt.
0,"Basara did not question Ceil’s two tails, only tapping on the stool for Ceil to sit."
0,She then soaked a rag in the steaming water and began wiping Ceil down.
0,"Coby trotted nearby, begging for similar treatment for his feathers."
0,"“I never heard of maenads,” Ceil said."
0,“Most elves haven’t.
0,We are fire nymphs.
0,"Maenads can be eccentric, violent, and difficult to interact with."
0,"Like other nymphs, they cannot use magic, so they cannot produce fire, but when a maenad enters a flame, that flame cannot be extinguished no matter the methods used."
0,"The Amelian Empire tried to eliminate them out of fear and hatred, so a war broke out."
0,"The other nymphs sided with the empire, and the maenads lost."
0,"Those few who avoided genocide fled to the wilderlands, my ancestors."
0,"Thankfully my human side mellowed my maenad impulses, but those same violent tendencies helped me succeed as a hunter mercenary.”"
0,“Genocide?
0,Why would the empire go so far-rrr…” Ceil cringed from overwhelming shivers as Basara forcefully wiped down her two tails.
0,"“Turn,” Basara ordered, and Ceil rotated to face her."
0,"“This is something you would never learn in the empire, but all nymphs were originally humans, slaves of the empire who refused to abandon their homeland after the elves took control of the fertile lands."
0,"You are a High Elf, correct?”"
0,"“Yes, but also fairy,” Ceil explained."
0,“You know the great Amelian Palace?
0,I assume you know what High Elf architecture looks like.
0,That palace is nothing similar.
0,It was built by humans.
0,Although I assume the elves have embellished it to their taste over the millennia.”
0,Ceil grabbed Basara’s hand and lifted it off her stomach.
0,“That can’t be.”
0,“It is.” Basara pried Ceil’s hand off and continued.
0,"“The Amelian Empire culled all humans with high magic proficiency, but they still feared an uprising."
0,"Adept life mages as High Elves are, they saturated human slaves with ven outside the humans’ elemental affinities to weaken those affinities."
0,"Treated as selectively bred livestock, female hair color grew more beautiful and vibrant, and though it lost its color when cut, it was quickly desired for textiles."
0,"Men were stronger, thus more dangerous, and their hair less vibrant and coarser."
0,There was little appeal to a male other than for the purpose of breeding the females.
0,No one wanted to house and feed more males than absolutely necessary.
0,They saw three choices.
0,"They had enough of a conscience to avoid the first, killing all infants born male that they did not need, although looking at the state of the nymphs now, that may have been the better option."
0,The last two fell back to breeding.
0,"They could breed males to the same desired state as females, or they could reduce male birthrate."
0,"After how many generations it took to produce the desired females, reducing birthrate was the quicker option."
0,"“A hundred or more human generations later under such torture and the enslaved humans became elementals incapable of magic, and male birthrate plummeted to near-unsustainable levels."
0,The plight of the nymphs is one very much of the Amelian Empire’s making.
0,"Eventually slavery was abolished, and the human elementals were rebranded as nymphs, another form of elfkind, but the maenads never forgave the empire."
0,"That hostility, combined with maenad aggression, and the empire wanted them eliminated as a matter of course.”"
0,"Basara finished wiping Ceil’s feet and grabbed a long, silken nymph gown that would conceal Ceil’s tails."
0,“This is only temporary until we clean your underskirt.”
0,"“Do you… also hate the Amelian Empire,” Ceil asked, unable or not wanting to comprehend what she just learned."
0,"Basara began wiping Coby’s feathers, just as fastidious as she was with Ceil."
0,“Not as much as some.
0,I have done contracts for them in the past.
0,"I do not have any personal grief with the empire, and my ancestral history is not enough reason to propagate the hatred."
0,"At the same time, there are others not of Tolmyur who take upon themselves the mantle of Tolmyur’s vengeance."
0,"I once travelled with such a man but could no longer bear it, so I left."
0,Shortly thereafter I met Zose and settled down.
0,"My earnings as a mercenary in the Coastal War afforded us this home, and Zose is an adept hunter mercenary in his own right."
0,This life is far better than wasting away in pursuit of an ancestral feud.”
0,Ceil’s hands slowly closed into fists.
0,"“I am sure…” She did not want to believe what Basara told her, but even if it was true, it happened tens of thousands of years ago."
0,No grudge should hold so long.
0,"“I am sure that the empire wanted to forget the past, to put an end to the feud between elves and humans."
0,"For the past thousands of years, not once did the Amelian Empire attack Tolmyur, and yet Tolmyur always tried to invade."
0,And now the assassinations.
0,The genocide of the fairies.”
0,“The modern Amelian Empire is not so innocent.
0,"Oppression from another country need not include open warfare,” Basara admonished, “but if you feel your cause is just, you can supplicate Bydrofe."
0,"As the Guardian of Whinhlem, he has often sided against unjust conflict to preserve the stability of our world."
0,"From what I understand, he already favors the elves over other races.”"
0,Bydrofe was a name all on Whinhlem knew.
0,There was a legend of a grand war before the founding of the Amelian Empire when the beastkin united to invade out of fear of the strength of the uniting elfkind.
0,Bydrofe alone withstood their might and turned them back to their continent.
0,Such a global war could have devastated Whinhlem.
0,"After so long a time, Ceil felt that Tolmyur’s grudge was unjustifiable."
0,"If Bydrofe was truly a protector of order, he should side with her in this conflict."
0,“I must speak with Bydrofe.” Ceil did not want vengeance.
0,"Her heart and mind was sick with it, but Basara was right."
0,"Avenging the dead will not end the conflict, only propagate it."
0,The war needed to end.
0,"Basara emptied the bucket in the entryway, dropped the soiled rag inside, and grabbed the stool."
0,"“It will be a hard journey, and you will need to convince the Afarit to allow you to meet him."
0,"Without a guide and someone to provide an introduction, you have no chance.”"
0,“I have nothing to offer but my armor and my body.”
0,“You could sell your Habha.
0,Many would pay a high price for him.”
0,Ceil looked to Coby who was preening his damp feathers.
0,“He is not mine to sell.
0,He accompanies me of his own will.”
0,“You can think on your options later.
1?,"It will grow dark soon, and you are welcome to stay.” Basara beckoned Ceil to follow her into the next room."
0,“Sit where comfortable.”
0,The room was not much larger than the entryway.
0,"There was no furniture, only large cushions lining the base of the walls sitting atop a wide and thick rug of interchanging orange and red diamond patterns spreading out from the center."
0,The rug covered all but the entry-side of the room allowing for a path to walk without stepping on it.
0,Two identical but smaller rugs also spread across the right and far walls adding to the room’s warmth.
0,"To the left was a stairway down to a lower room, the wall nearby open like a balcony above it."
0,Most of the home was underground.
0,"Below, Basara’s two daughters dressed themselves while Zose carried two buckets of clouded water up the steps, dumping them out the entryway as Basara had."
0,Ceil sat back into a cushion in the corner and watched Zose return three more times with full buckets.
0,“Where do you draw your water?” she asked.
0,"“We have a well in the room right below this one,” the eldest daughter explained pointing straight down."
0,"She sat down on a cushion next to Ceil and tucked her legs under her and to the side, almost leaning on Ceil."
0,She wore a similar Nymph gown of pristine white that only made her now glistening orange hair even more vibrant.
0,“Zose dug it after mother bought the house.
0,She heats the water with magic for us when we need it.”
0,“Can Basara use magic?”
0,"“I can,” Basara answered as she returned from the room below."
0,"“Nymphs cannot use magic, but half-nymphs can.” She sat on the other side of her daughter who quickly shifted the position of her legs to now lean against her mother."
0,“My affinity to fire is stronger than both minums and elves because I am half fire nymph.”
0,Ceil’s eyes fell to the rug.
0,Chloe could have easily been considered a half-Maenad if she was from Whinhlem.
0,"Her fire was so powerful, and because of that power, Ceil relied too heavily on her, leading to constant injury, capture, and eventually death, falling into that bottomless fissure."
0,Tolmyur didn’t kill Chloe.
0,She did.
0,Ceil didn’t want to say or hear anymore.
0,She pulled her legs to her chest and hid her face in her arms.
0,"Coby approached with a light cry, and Ceil grabbed him, pulling him into an embrace as she once again fought back her tears."
0,He struggled at first but soon submitted to his fate.
0,"“Dana, keep her company while your father and I talk,” Basara asked."
0,"“You too,” Zose said as he pushed the youngest in Ceil’s direction after retrieving a bucket from her."
0,"He had finished draining the bath, and his daughter wanted to help with the final bucket."
0,"After dumping the final bucket, Zose and Basara walked together down to the lower rooms."
0,"Chapter 3
“An Urgent Message”
Zose
"
1?,Zose followed Basara down the steps and under the top room.
0,A small prep station with an oiled iron plate sat against the right wall for food preparation.
0,"Basara only needed to heat the plate to cook, removing the need for kindling or fuel."
0,"The well sat in the center of the room, and a large, raised bath was positioned in the corner to the left, large enough for the family to bathe together comfortably."
0,"A spout at one end facilitated draining the bath water into a bucket, removing the need to draw the water out."
0,Across the kitchen an opening led to remnants of ruins dug out and repurposed into living quarters.
0,A large curtain divided the room between the parents’ and children’s portions.
0,"Like the lounge above, both sides of the room were covered with large rugs and filled with plentiful cushions, only long and flat for sleep instead of relaxation."
0,"Basara sat on their bed of piled cushions, and Zose sat beside her."
0,"“That girl, she is the missing wife of Emperor Yuro,” she spoke in a quieted, worried voice."
0,"Zose crossed his legs and leaned forward, fiddling with his fingers in his lap."
0,"“She called herself a concubine, and I do not get the impression she was lying."
0,"Concubines are outlawed in all but Vallen, and I heard her say she is part fairy."
0,The royal family would not take a mixed breed as a wife.
0,"There was no lie in her voice, and she does not seem to be one skilled with lying."
0,She struggles enough to hide her own emotions.”
0,"“She has two tails, as the wanted posters claim.”"
0,“Could she not be another with two tails?”
0,"“That would be rarer than even you, a renegade sire."
0,Where did you find her?”
0,“She fled north from Vallen to escape the Tolmyur invasion.
0,I found her huddled on the pass on my way back from exterminating the Lurr in Hurno Quarry.”
0,"“You already suspected it, didn’t you.”"
0,Zose nodded.
0,"He suspected, but he did not want to believe his suspicions."
0,“The only reason Jethro would eliminate the fairies is if he was searching for her there.
0,"His wrath was always direct, never indiscriminate."
0,He has fallen further in this past year.” Basara turned Zose to face her.
0,"“We cannot hide her here.” Her existence was too potent a threat for their family, especially their young daughters."
0,“Abandoning her in the wilderlands is a death sentence.
0,Eventually someone will grow suspicious or assault her and learn who she is.
0,The bounty on her is a king’s treasury.”
0,"“After I saw her tails, I suggested she seek out a guide to bring her to audience with Bydrofe,” Basara explained."
0,Zose thought in silence for a moment.
0,“She will never be permitted to see him.
0,"She may be royalty, but royal visits to the titans must come with forward announcements."
0,They must come with gifts equivalent to the honor of meeting a guardian of Whinhlem.
0,They come with fanfare and processions enough for a festival.
0,Ceil has none of these.”
0,“That is why it may be easier for her.
0,Fallen royalty is no more than a commoner to the Afarit.
0,Wealth is not what the Afarit desire.”
0,"“Proof of conviction…” Zose realized, his voice trailing off as the idea slowly grew in his mind."
0,"This might be the surest option, especially if the Afarit would not see Ceil as royalty."
0,"“But, in Ceil’s position, the only offering she could make that is great enough is her life."
0,Anything less would never pass Afarit scrutiny.”
0,Basara saw in Zose’s slowly falling brow that he was about to reject her suggestion.
0,He did not see the vital key Jethro gave them.
0,“We do not need Ceil to forfeit her life.
0,We only need the threat of it.”
0,Zose’s eyes widened as the brilliance of his wife filled in all the gaps.
0,"He looked over at her, amazed."
0,The threat to Ceil had to be real and present.
0,Jethro and Tolmyur needed to be involved directly for the plan to work.
0,Basara’s voice grew weak.
0,"“I understand Jethro’s ire, but he is ruining himself, Amel, and Tolmyur."
0,We should let Bydrofe decide if Jethro’s actions are justified.
0,Perhaps only he can turn him from his course.”
0,Basara leaned into Zose’s shoulder.
0,"He knew she was committed to him and their daughters, and her love was true, but he also understood her longing and sorrow over her former companion."
0,She left Jethro because she could not stop him.
0,Basara suggested this route not only for Ceil but also for Jethro.
1,"* * *
Zose woke early in the morning before Basara and his daughters."
0,Ceil lay between Dana and Emal wrapped in their arms with her Habha perched near her head.
0,He was awake staring at Zose but did not make a sound.
0,"The creature was intelligent, at least enough not to disturb his master or the sleeping children."
0,"To Zose, Coby almost appeared as Ceil’s guardian more than she his master."
0,Zose bowed lightly to the regal hawk who bowed back as he left the room.
0,It was truly a peculiar thing to see such a territorial and aggressive bird keeping watch over the young so silently.
0,"Perhaps Coby was trained from an eyas, but to Zose’s knowledge the Amelian royalty had never employed taming practices like hawking although they did breed hounds."
0,"Even if hawking was a recent development, no sane hawker would raise a Habha."
0,"Zose had use for a bird, a message to be delivered, but he could not use Coby."
0,"Ib’nua trained birds, and he was leaving early to claim the swiftest before others could."
0,"On his way through the prep room, Zose grabbed a roll from a small box at the end of the counter."
0,"Its dry crust cracked in his teeth, but the dark bitter bread underneath was soft."
0,"In the next room, he penned out his message by tallow candlelight on a thin strip of parchment that could be fastened around a messenger bird’s leg."
0,"It was brief, but the recipient would understand the meaning."
0,Zose grabbed his cloak from a rack by the entryway.
0,"Both his and Ceil’s armor and equipment hung on similar racks to dry, Basara and he having cleaned them after their private discussion the previous evening."
0,Ceil’s armor contained plates of resfahil intermixed with the other metals--a critical find.
0,"Taking Ceil through a portal would be fatal, although there was little chance of that happening yet."
0,There were no spatial mages in Ib’nua and very few in the wilderlands.
0,"Anyone with spatial magic proficiency would easily be able to secure employment elsewhere, so those in the wilderlands were often dangerous sorts in the employment of even more dangerous company."
0,At least the amount of resfahil would provide excellent magic resistance so long as it was not precision magic aimed where the metal did not cover.
0,"Much of the mud frosted over at night, crunching beneath Zose’s boots."
0,"The hard, uneven ground complicated his simple walk down the road."
0,He paid attention to where he set each foot in the dark so that he wouldn’t trip or roll his ankle.
0,"Few were out in the dark of the early morning sending out puffs of breath in the frigid air, but more would appear the closer he got to the central commerce hub of Ib’nua."
0,"Merchants and traders often woke early, and so he needed to as well."
0,The commerce hall was not a guild--such formal organizations did not exist in the wilderlands.
0,"It was merely a location where the people of Ib’nua gathered for trade and other transactions between fellow businessmen and women outside their dealings with general customers, mostly to secure products for the day, pay debts, collect on contracts, and hire services."
0,Messenger birds were one of those services.
0,"Half wood and half stone, it cut into one of the mounded hills to make use of the ruins underneath and resembled a warehouse more than a shop or home."
0,The deepest part of the structure was the home of a private lender.
0,Monetary exchanged did not use coins but rare metals weighted and stamped with the metal’s purity.
0,It was this lender and his stores of gold and silver that caused merchants and traders to congregate here for business.
0,"For the sake of the community, he never charged for the use of his facilities for business."
0,The congregation of merchants earned him plenty through the exchange of the rare metals.
0,"Mornings were often long and dark in the valley, but that did not stop the bustle of business."
0,The commerce hall was the busiest location in town before the sun rose high enough on the horizon beyond the mountains to light the sky.
0,"Shortly after the valley was bathed in the shadow of the mountains, not the blanket of night, the hall would almost grow deserted as the merchants and traders moved to their shops."
0,Zose weaved through the crowd of boisterous voices and bulk product to stone steps in the back of the hall.
0,The aviary for messenger birds sat on the second floor.
0,The high-pitched calls of the birds pierced even the cacophony of business.
0,"Like the merchants and traders, the birds too had learned to wake before the rise of the sun."
1,"“Do you know of any spatial mages in town,” Zose asked Amor, the manager of the aviary, a rather elderly fairy who trained his birds by flying with them to their destinations."
0,"“None to my knowledge, hunter,” Amor replied promptly."
0,“Have an urgent message?”
0,“I need a spik to Amel if you have one.
0,Your fastest.”
0,“We have one spik trained for Amel.
0,"High cost, but it will get there in six days.”"
0,Zose set his coin pouch on the table by the cage door.
0,Amor loosed the tie and emptied the shards of silver onto the table.
0,"He inspected the stamped imprints and separated the shards into their four purity ranks, weighed them, and shook his head."
0,“You are short by over half.”
0,"Zose thought he brought enough to hire four of the swiftest birds--all the disposable silver he and Basara had on hand--but Amel was far, so hiring a bird, especially one as fickle and troublesome to train as a spik, was sure to be expensive."
0,"Every message sent was a possibility the messenger would not return, and he was paying that insurance."
0,“I have a contract still to collect.
0,Can you hold sale of the spik until I return?”
0,Amor claimed two of the smaller shards of low purity not caring to weigh them.
0,“Be quick.”
1,Zose rushed down the stairs and into the repurposed ruins.
0,The money lenders handled payments of hunter mercenary contracts.
0,"The pay was deposited there in reserve for when the contract was completed, and the lender kept a small portion of the reward for bookkeeping and handling costs."
0,He cut to an empty counter before an approaching merchant had the chance to claim it.
0,"“Zose, glad to see you returned safe."
0,"After the first hunter failed, I was worried you might as well."
0,"I assume you completed the contract instead of fleeing?” Jit, a pixy and owner of the commerce hall, smiled at Zose."
0,His light voice showed his confidence in Zose’s skill as a hunter mercenary.
0,"Zose and Basara had bought their home from him, and Jit’s curiosity about a nymph couple relocating to Ib’nua led to a number of drink invitations and eventually a deep relationship between Zose’s family and the man who was the center of commerce in Ib’nua."
0,“The contract is complete.
0,A matter arose that requires me to claim the reward immediately.”
0,"“We will send out inspectors to Hurno Quarry, but it will take about seven days.”"
0,"“Immediately,” Zose repeated."
0,"Jit raised a judgmental eyebrow, so Zose clarified."
0,“I would like to take out a loan against the reward for the elimination of the chimera.”
0,Jit nodded and flew off to the back wall where piles of parchment sat atop rows and rows of shelves.
0,"He grabbed a sheet larger than him and returned, setting the leger on the table."
0,“Here is your contract.
0,Please sign the amount to forward from the reward and provide a blood-print.”
0,Zose signed for double the estimated value the aviary manager said he lacked.
0,He did not want to short his reward by paying usury on more than what was needed.
0,"In matters of business, Jit treated friends no different than any other customer."
0,Whatever remained he would return to Basara for home spending.
0,Zose pricked his forefinger on a provided knife and pressed it beside his name and loan value.
0,Jit waved his hand.
0,"A spriggan quickly grabbed the ledger and retrieved the metal weight and purity, far too heavy for a pixy to carry."
0,“My thanks.”
1,Zose returned to the aviary and set the additional silver shards on the table to be weighed.
0,"“The message,” Amor requested, and Zose handed over the tiny roll of parchment."
0,"The fairy was about to walk through the door of the cage, but Zose clasped his hand on his shoulder."
0,"“Amor, in front of me, please,” Zose asked."
0,"The secrecy of the message was too important for him to take any chances of foul play, not that he had any doubt in the established aviary manager."
0,His request for visibility was more for peace of mind.
0,Amor handed back the message and retrieved the spik.
0,"It was a small bird with sharp, angular wings in flight like the head of an arrow."
0,"Like Habha, it had a natural wind affinity that further improved its speed but lacked the intelligence to utilize it outside of flight."
0,"Spiks were certainly more agile, but Zose did not know who would win in an all-out race between a spik and a Habha."
0,The spik hopped off Amor’s hand onto the table.
0,"Although its focus jittered about, it did not fly off."
0,Its curious inspection of its surroundings ceased immediately with a light whistled click of the fairy’s tongue.
0,It rolled onto its back sticking its feet up into the air--perfectly trained.
0,Amor retrieved Zose’s message and wrapped it around the spik’s leg.
0,"He then wrapped another strip of parchment dyed black, the same color of the spik’s plumage, to the other leg to counterbalance the message."
0,"As fast and agile as spiks were, even slight imbalances could complicate flight, at least enough to prevent it from flying at top speed."
0,"“To calm your worries, you may be the one to release it."
0,Extend your hand.”
0,"Zose held out his hand, and the spik hopped on it after a different tonal click from its trainer."
0,Zose followed to the aviary window and sent the bird off into the dark morning.
0,It immediately headed south out of view.
0,* * *
1,The spik rose high into the air until the cold wind chilled it through its feathers.
0,"Spiks were a cold-weather, mountain-dwelling bird."
0,"Unless hit directly with ice magic, no cold would hinder it."
0,"It ignored the winding path for the earth-bound travelers and rose higher and higher over the first of many Nuanae ridges, only it did not travel much further."
0,"It descended to a small shack post in the snow-dusted forest, entering the window."
0,"“Inym, we have a black tag."
0,"Urgent message,” a thickly robed spriggan announced."
0,"He shivered in the airy shack, his race naturally unaccustomed to such cold climes."
0,The spik hopped along the windowsill waiting for someone to retrieve the message.
0,"“Don’t just stand there,” an emaciated female troll rebuked."
0,"“Read it, and if it’s personal, send the spik on its way.”"
0,"Known only to the influential heads of Ib’nua, all urgent messages were screened whether sent by land post or air to prepare against any information that might hint of danger to Ib’nua’s community."
0,"The spriggan clicked his tongue, and the spik rolled to its back for him to retrieve the message."
0,“I cannot read it.
0,"I think it’s a Tolmyurin tongue or similar, but not Minum.”"
0,Inym snagged the thin strip of parchment away.
0,“Check the destination.”
0,"Spreading the breast feathers of the spik revealed a small, branded scar."
0,“Amel.
0,What fool would be sending a message there?”
0,Inym did not know whether to be excited or scared.
0,“We have the one you seek at the Afarit.
0,No sender name.” The implications were indeed dangerous.
0,"There was only one reason why this message would be sent to the Tolmyur-controlled former capital of the Amelian Empire, and spiks were too expensive to send unless the sender was absolutely sure."
0,The wife of Emperor Yuro was found.
0,"She was at or near Ib’nua, and someone was planning on claiming the bounty, a king’s bounty, enough to buy all of Ib’nua thrice over."
0,“Does that mean Tolmyur will be coming to Ib’nua?” The spriggan rose in a panic.
0,He too had realized the meaning of the message.
0,"“No,” she replied."
0,“No.
0,Ib’nua was not mentioned.
0,The sender did not want to burden the city or endanger whatever livelihood they have there.
0,"They probably want to involve Hain-henel, the Lord of Contracts, to make certain Tolmyur would not cross them.” A grin spread on her face."
0,They were the only two other than the sender who knew the wife was here.
0,“We cannot send this message.
0,The wilderlands are not unified enough to defend against Tolmyur.
0,Keep the spik here for its duration.
0,I’ll inform Jit.”
0,Inym wrapped a thick leather cloak over her shoulders and walked out into the chill.
0,Her hunter mercenary blood that had long grown stale now boiled with adrenaline-fueled excitement.
0,"She was too weak to capture or kill the wife and sender of the message, at least by force, but she had connections who would be more than willing to share in such a bounty."
0,She only needed to discover the identity of the sender.
0,Chapter 4 “Rumors” Ceil
1,"“You should eat,” Basara ordered from over her shoulder as Dana and Emal hurried their emptied bowls to the small wash basin near the well."
0,Ceil sat on a cushion in the corner of the room between the bath and entry to the bedroom.
0,"On the small, low table not unlike those she saw in Revlan sat a bitter dark roll, a bowl of stew, and a platter of thick cream almost exhausted from Basara and her daughters having used it to soften the flavor of their bitter rolls."
0,“I can tell how famished you are by your complexion.
0,Did Zose not feed you on your journey here?”
0,"“He did… He tried,” Ceil corrected."
0,She did not want Basara to misunderstand.
0,“I do not have an appetite.”
0,“Because of what’s happening in Vallen?” Basara flash-heated her daughters’ washed earthenware bowls to dry them and set them back on the counter.
0,She nudged her daughters off to the adjacent room with the stairway where they immediately latched onto Coby.
0,She then knelt across the table from Ceil.
0,"“If you plan on traveling north to see Bydrofe, you will need your strength."
0,Eat.” Basara held her hand over the bowl to heat it again.
0,“You are forbidden from leaving that cushion until your food is gone.”
0,Ceil shrunk under Basara’s gaze.
0,"Her eyes had an immense weight to them, but at the same time they were comforting, like a heavy fur quilt."
0,Ceil snapped a piece off the roll’s crust and wiped it in the cream.
0,"“Good,” Basara said."
0,"This home of a nymph and half nymph was too comforting, too welcoming, and that terrified Ceil."
0,"Ib’nua was close to Vallen, perhaps only seven or eight days away from Revlan."
0,"Death and destruction followed her, and her very presence was a danger to this loving family."
0,They were not like the immortal sprites who had nothing to fear from Jethro or Tolmyur.
0,"Ceil wanted to hide under that heavy, warm quilt, and let others deal with the evils of the world, but she would kill Zose, Basara, Dana, and Emal as she had everyone else if she stayed."
0,It was she whom those evils hunted.
0,Ceil swallowed a mouthful of the chunky stew.
0,"It lacked flavor, much like the skewer from before."
0,"Perhaps spices were not available in Ib’nua, or at least at a price Zose and Basara could afford."
0,“Where can I find a guide to take me to Bydrofe?” Ceil asked.
0,“You do not need to worry about that.
0,"Zose and I talked last night, and he has agreed to guide you,” Basara explained."
0,The roll cracked in Ceil’s grip.
0,Her fear stuttered her reply.
0,"“No… No, I can’t have you… I can’t let Zose guide me."
0,It would be--”
0,“Dangerous?” Basara interrupted.
0,“Wouldn’t it then be dangerous for any guide you hired?
0,What makes Zose different?
0,Because we took you in and welcomed you into our home?
0,Any guide you hire will have a life of their own and possibly a family of their own.
0,"The only difference is that you do not know about them, so your conscience will be clearer.”"
0,Ceil could not offer a rebuttal.
0,“And how would you pay?
0,Your body and armor as you said before?
0,Pay your guide the resfahil upfront and let him bed you every night of your journey?
0,"Those small shards of fahil may help cover travel costs, but your guide can’t live off sex."
0,"There is no guide who would take such payment, and anyone who would should not be trusted."
0,You will find yourself sold to a brothel or worse.”
0,“I’ve been sold before…”
0,Basara knelt back down and leaned over the table to look Ceil squarely in the eyes.
0,Ceil’s gaze reflexively drifted downward to stare at her still unfinished breakfast.
0,“Accept our offer.
0,It is the best you are going to get.”
0,“Why would you help me?
0,What would you gain from this?”
0,"“We also want this war to end, but Zose or I supplicating Bydrofe will not sway him to action."
0,What would we complain about?
0,The decline of economic flow into Ib’nua from the fallen empire?
0,Stories we have heard from those who have fled into the wilderlands?
0,"It must be you, someone displaced by Tolmyur’s invasion, and we want to help.”"
0,Ceil considered telling Basara who she was.
0,"If Basara knew, then she would better understand the danger her very presence would cause them and their family."
0,"Tolmyur would continue hunting her down, and if Zose was there when they found her, he would not survive."
0,“Eat.” Basara lifted Ceil’s bowl and pushed it to her chest.
0,"Again the stew reheated, and the hot bowl stung where it touched."
0,“Don’t make me ask again.
0,I will not reheat it a third time.
0,Eat it warm now or eat it cold.
0,Your choice.” She walked away to the next room to help Dana pull Emal off the distressed Habha.
0,Ceil quickly finished her meal.
0,"She needed to leave, to be rid of this family before she could harm them."
0,"They were too goodwilled, and their goodwill would ruin them if directed at her."
1,"She dropped her bowl in the wash basin by the well and hurried up the stairs, calling Coby."
0,"He rose with a flap of his wings, his wingspan nearly the width of the stairway room."
0,The gust that launched him up and over the main-floor balcony knocked Basara and her daughters to the floor.
0,"Ceil turned into the entryway and ran face-first into Zose, knocking her to her back."
0,Zose’s footing was solid.
0,He did not move.
0,“Running off?” he asked.
0,Basara rushed up the stairs but slowed when she saw Zose.
0,Ceil could hear Emal whimpering below and Dana trying to console her.
0,"“Here, this is what’s left over.” Zose handed Basara a small coin purse."
0,“I had to take out a small loan against the Lurr contract to pay for it.”
0,"Ceil expected to be scolded, but Basara only retrieved the purse with a rigid hand and returned downstairs."
0,Zose extended his hand to Ceil.
0,"She accepted it, and he pulled her to her feet."
0,“We can leave tomorrow as soon as preparations are made.
0,"Going unprepared into the wilderlands is suicide, especially in winter.”"
0,"Coby hopped around anxiously fluttering his wings, not knowing what Ceil wanted to do."
0,"“We are not leaving yet,” she told him while caressing the side of his beak."
0,She resigned herself to the goodwill of this odd nymph family.
0,For better or worse.
0,* * *
1,"The next morning, Basara helped Ceil don her armor and even provided her a thin Tolmyurin sword."
0,“For when your staff cannot help you.
0,"It was mine from the Coastal War.” The hamadryad staff was currently half of its full length and could be used as a weapon, but lacking its benefit of reach, a sword would be more practical in close-proximity combat."
0,"At least growing the stubborn wood proved beneficial, yet difficult, practice of Ceil’s life magic."
0,"“I will make certain Zose returns with it,” Ceil promised."
0,"No matter what may come of her, she wanted Zose to return to his family."
0,I will die this time before I let anyone else.
0,Ceil retrieved the cloak Zose held out.
0,“Coby.”
0,Coby tried to hop forward into the entryway but was held back by Emal.
0,"Despite the scare the previous day, the young girl had grown attached to the hawk that stood taller than her."
0,She cried out in protest when Basara pried her away.
1,"Coby trilled at the crying girl and hopped backwards into the entryway, never breaking eye contact until the last moment when Ceil led him outside."
0,“Habha are far more affable than I could have ever imagined.
0,Emal is going to be heartbroken.
0,Perhaps we should think of taming one too.
0,I have made trips to Fiorrae before.”
0,“I advise against it.
0,"Coby is an odd one, and the one who tamed him… Sammy, she was an odd one too…” Ceil’s pace slowed."
0,"“Perhaps you could tell me the story of how you and Sammy met, and if you know, how she tamed Coby."
0,I would consider that payment enough for guiding you.”
0,“That cannot be enough compensation.”
0,“You will understand when you have children.
0,You can never put a price on your child’s happiness.
0,We will have plenty of time to talk on our way.”
0,Ceil kept Coby close to not bother the villagers.
0,The number of people who stared at her had decreased now that a heavy winter cloak hid her purple jack.
0,Zose led her between the mounded hills to the northern edge of town.
0,"Only a few people acknowledged Zose, but there she saw it again, the twitch of the eyes between Zose and a few others as if it was some odd form of greeting."
0,They exited the city north on a far more traveled road than the one leading south.
0,"There were few who traveled to Vallen now that Tolmyur had invaded, and perhaps there were few even before."
0,"Ceil’s only experience with the people from the wilderlands were Zose’s family and the traveling merchant who used to visit Heivleil, so she could not say for certain, but there seemed to be a general disdain for the Amelian Empire among people who lived in the wilderlands."
0,"“So, all Sammy did was save Coby from Tolmyur soldiers and then take care of him?” Zose summarized, rather surprised."
0,"“It was more than that, I think."
0,Her care and asserting authority over him might have been part of it.
0,Maybe speaking the language of the sprites also helped.
0,I do not know if all Habha can understand it or just him.
0,He is still independent and often hunts on his own like he is doing now.”
1,"Coby cried from above, and Ceil thought he was about to drop his most recent catch near her as he had done so often in the past--she suspected it was on purpose to get a rise out of her--but this cry was different."
0,Ceil stopped.
0,"“Something is wrong,” she said."
0,"Coby flew down and hovered just above them, his large flapping wings spreading the snow on the pass road."
0,"Zose quickly grew attentive and retrieved the bow from his back, nocking an arrow on the string."
0,Ceil looked around at the trees lining the road and the steep rock crags behind them.
0,She desperately wished Sammy was here to understand Coby’s cry.
1,A pale man walked out from behind one of the trees.
0,His hair was blond but with a faint green sheen.
0,"He was not as tall as a High Elf, and his ears were not long and angular but instead curved back until becoming thin, dangling cartilage."
0,His thick and freely waving tail had a leaf-like fin.
0,"Ceil had never seen a Sea Elf, a fresh-water siren, before."
0,"“Keep thinking of something, anything,” Zose warned in a whisper."
0,“Do not let your mind go blank.”
0,"“Zose, sorry to startle you,” the Sea Elf said, holding his hands up and palms turned away to show he was not armed."
0,“I do not want trouble.
0,I only want to know the identity of this girl.
0,I am sure you understand why.
0,A female elf of about two to three years in age.”
0,Ceil knew what the Sea Elf was suggesting.
0,"The age was off, but she was shorter than other High Elves, so reducing her age by a year would make identifying her easier."
0,The wilderlands also knew Tolmyur was searching for her.
0,Tolmyur was not her only enemy here.
0,“She is unrelated.
0,Gein is the daughter of an acquaintance of Basara’s from Vallen.
0,"She’s five years old, half Fairy.”"
0,Coby fell from the air into a snowbank his flapping created beside the road.
0,No weapon or magic hit him.
0,Ceil hurried to him and quickly found herself growing dizzy.
0,She had heard that the voices of sirens were their greatest weapons.
0,"The voice could not be lethal, but they could produce debilitating sounds and have even been known to knock others unconscious with tones unnoticeable to the ears."
0,Perhaps Zose’s warning was a countermeasure against such an attack.
0,She fell to her knees.
0,“I only want to make sure.
0,"Others in Ib’nua have been talking, and if you don’t want them growing any more suspicious, they need proof."
0,Show me her tail.”
0,“What kind of degenerate siren would ask a young elf to reveal her tail?” Even Zose began showing signs of nausea and exhaustion.
0,"His hands gripped the bow, but he could not draw it."
0,"Instead, he reached for his blade, but his fingers soon grew too weak to remove it from its sheath."
0,"“Better than her being attacked by mistake,” the Sea Elf reasoned."
0,His hand reached down towards Ceil.
1,An arrow flew from atop the crags and hit the Sea Elf in the back.
0,A second quickly followed.
0,"A fairy appeared on the other side of the road and hurled an earthen spike at Zose, but he recovered in time to dodge it and fired an arrow of his own."
0,It hit center in the chest of the fairy.
0,"Coby flailed about atop the snow drift and flew back into the air with a cry, but there was nothing for him to attack."
0,“Zose!” A Forrest Elf jumped down the crag and approached.
0,"Zose did not show any hostility, so neither did Coby."
0,"Ceil sat on the snow wondering what happened, her mind foggy from the imperceptible sounds of the siren."
0,"Another elf ran to them from down the road, this one a Mountain Elf, but he was neither as tall nor with enough physique to be a normal Mountain Elf."
0,"Mountain Elves could not grow facial hair, much like High Elves, but he had growth on his chin."
0,Ceil recognized him as one of the people with whom Zose exchanged those eye-movement greetings both the evening they arrived in Ib’nua and right before they left the city.
0,"“Jeddin, Dyson, you cut that too close,” Zose said with a shake of his head."
0,“To think they would grow suspicious that fast.”
0,"“I expected you to be followed, not ambushed."
0,"I wouldn’t have caught up in time,” Dyson replied with a small-fanged grin."
0,“You are lucky spriggans are quick on their feet.”
0,"“When you told us that danger might be following you, I wondered what kind of mess you got yourself into."
0,"You should know that with such a bounty on the widow of Yuro that traveling with an elf girl would be dangerous,” the other rebuked."
0,“She’s half fairy and fled from Vallen.
0,I am taking her where she will be safe.
0,We already had that attack on an elf girl in Ib’nua a few days before I headed for Hurno Quarry.
0,I didn’t want Gein to be caught up in all that.”
0,"“Who are they,” Ceil asked, unable to understand the wilderlands language they conversed in."
0,"A few of the words were similar to Elven, but the grammar was different enough that Ceil could not make any sense of it."
0,"“Hunter mercenary acquaintances of mine, Jeddin and Dyson,” Zose introduced pointing to the Forrest Elf and Mountain Elf respectively."
0,“I told them trouble might follow me and asked them to watch for suspicious activity as we left Ib’nua.”
0,"“You could at least call us friends,” Dyson chided."
0,“There are no friends among hunter mercenaries.
0,"You know that,” Jeddin replied while stripping the Sea Elf of what usable equipment he had."
0,"Clearly this was the case, baffling to Ceil as it was."
0,"The Sea Elf seemed to know Zose, but Zose and his acquaintances did not hesitate to kill him just as he did not hesitate to attack Zose."
0,Now the two bodies were being stripped.
0,"“What about your brother,” Dyson retorted."
0,“Family is different.”
0,"“When did you speak with them,” Ceil asked Zose."
0,"The Mountain Elf, if that was his race, knelt down and extended his hand."
0,“Saccadic speech.
0,"Hunter mercenary code, miss.” His eyes twitched with slight but very specific movements."
0,"She grabbed his hand, and he pulled her back to her feet."
0,“You need only glance at someone to relay a message.”
0,"As Dyson stared into Ceil’s eyes, his expression warmed, pulling a light smile across his cheeks."
0,It was a strange mix of light surprise and endearment.
0,"The more she stared, the more she found the smile blatantly flirtatious."
0,"“Take a few breaths, and the siren fatigue will wear off,” he said."
0,“We should move before others come.”
0,"Coby soared above them, now vigilant, and Zose lead their group down the road."
0,"“Are you a Mountain Elf,” Ceil asked without realizing her question might be insulting, her mind still foggy."
0,Dyson laughed.
0,"“Don’t look it, eh?"
0,Not built enough?
0,"You are new to the wilderlands, so I think you should know."
0,Drop those monikers here.
0,I am not an elf.
0,You are an elf.
0,"Well, half-elf."
0,"I am a troll, but also quarter human."
0,My grandmother was human.”
0,"“You will find very few with pure blood outside the Amelian Empire,” Zose followed."
0,"“Like Basara and Dyson, many in the wilderlands have human in them somewhere in their ancestry and are further mixed with other races where compatibility is possible.”"
0,"“Jeddin is a purebred spriggan, although his brother is different,” Dyson said."
0,“Spriggans have trouble breeding with other races except the afarit and I guess Lurr.”
0,"“Don’t speak of me as if I am some animal,” Jeddin chided."
0,"The light conversation helped Ceil’s mind find ground and recover, but with that recovery came a grave worry."
0,"“If the Sea Elf… I mean siren… If he and that fairy suspected me of being the emperor’s widow, and they knew I was staying with you and Basara, wouldn’t that endanger her and your daughters?”"
0,Ceil’s anxiety bubbled up within her.
0,She stopped walking.
0,"As she feared, she placed Zose’s family in danger."
0,Dyson laughed again.
0,"“I consider myself skilled in fire magic, but I do not think anyone, even an afarit, could compete with Basara."
0,No one would dare attack her or her daughters.
0,The last thief that broke into their home was left outside her entryway in an unrecognizable burning husk as a warning to anyone else that might try the same.”
0,"“Stunk up the house for days,” Zose added."
0,“And my daughters know to hide in the stone at the first sign of danger.
0,They will be safe.”
0,"“Never anger a maenad,” Jeddin advised."
0,"“The more level-headed maenads will give warnings when you irritate them, but set one off and you will be fighting for your life."
0,How Zose managed a stable family with one is beyond me.”
0,"“It’s quite easy,” Zose boasted."
0,"“Just keep her happy, and you will never find a more loyal and beautiful wife!”"
0,“Where are you planning to take Gein?” Dyson asked.
0,Ceil was glad they were now speaking to each other in Elven.
0,"“The Afarit,” Zose replied."
0,"“After the murder of that poor elf in Ib’nua, Basara and I knew she would not be safe there."
0,"So long as we can make the right deal with Hain-henel, they will shelter her there and protect her with the full power of the city if needed.”"
0,Ceil’s heart sank.
0,An innocent girl had been mistaken as her and killed.
0,She recalled the young girl the Gallanvale marshal tried to pass off as her to Jethro.
0,She recalled the girls impaled and set erect in the raised cities of Vallen.
0,The same was happening even in the wilderlands.
0,"“Fleeing to the wilderlands was foolish,” Jeddin sighed."
0,“Where else could I have gone?
0,"I did not have a choice,” Ceil mumbled."
0,"“What’s your story,” Dyson asked with an expression of care."
0,"“Basara knows the details better than me, and Gein won’t open up about it."
0,"She was a concubine, but that’s about all I know.”"
0,"“I am the great-granddaughter of Thorn General Dharin and cousin to Royal Chief Advisor Kiri.” Ceil explained, much to Zose’s surprise."
0,"His reply was a clear hint for her to keep silent, but she thought best that if she was to play to her fairy blood to hide her identity, she should be honest about it."
0,"If that knowledge somehow revealed her identity, she no longer cared."
0,The group halted.
0,“Dharin?
0,The Dharin of Kellendale?
0,He is Thorn General again?
0,"I thought he retired,” Zose said in exasperation."
0,“He did.
0,Kiri’s husband was Thorn General until he fell in defense of Amel.
0,Dharin reclaimed the position to fight back against the genocide in Vallen.”
0,"“Dharin is twin to Dhurin, the late Fairy High King."
0,So you weren’t just any concubine but a royal consort?
0,By the gods…” Zose rubbed his forehead.
0,“It’s almost every season I learn Basara has some connection to another major power.
0,Now Vallen royalty?”
0,Ceil did not know what Basara had told him in her discussions with Zose.
0,"She knew Zose’s claim that Basara knew Ceil was a lie, and he had even hidden her name, but his frustrations did not seem like an act."
0,"Or if it was an act, it was terribly convincing."
0,Did Basara perhaps have connections with Vallen royalty and then told Zose she knew Ceil to convince him to take her to Bydrofe?
0,"Ceil wanted to explain that she did not know Basara to try and clear up any misunderstanding that might cause tension in their family, but the ruse was now too far matured."
0,"Dyson shook his head, seemingly understanding of Zose’s grief."
0,“What did you expect marrying the most famous hunter mercenary?
0,I’m sure she’s been all over the continent and has connections in every corner.”
0,"“I am abstaining from contracts until winter ends, so I can help you take Gein north,” Jeddin offered."
0,"“I was close to the elf who was murdered, so I understand why you want Gein to be safe.”"
0,"“I thought there were no friends among hunter mercenaries,” Dyson quipped."
0,“I hate this war as much as anyone else.
0,Its consequences are spreading beyond the empire’s borders.
0,This is my way of alleviating some of the pain caused by the warfare.”
0,“But war is profitable.
0,"That’s how Zose and Basara made their fortune,” Dyson laughed."
0,"“I don’t take mercenary work, only hunting contracts,” Jeddin said."
0,"“I am taking contracts,” Dyson said with a smile."
0,“How about hiring me as a bodyguard?
0,I can’t do too many favors.”
0,"“I have nothing to pay you with,” Ceil admitted."
0,"Dyson’s warm smile returned, this time with a hint of playfulness."
0,“How about a taste of your skill as a royal consort?”
0,Zose glared at Dyson.
0,"“A Joke,” Dyson deflected with his small-fanged grin."
0,"“There are no good contracts in Ib’nua right now, so I was planning on heading north anyway."
0,"I’ll travel with you, and if someone attacks you, that also puts me in danger, so I will have no choice but to fight back, right?”"
0,"“Thank you…” Ceil replied, but secretly she did not want them involved."
0,They were endangering themselves more than they knew by associating with her.
0,* * *
1,"“One would think that with so much air on the surface, a siren would be able to think more clearly,” Inym spat."
0,"“Now Zose will be more guarded, and that Habha is no longer leaving them.”"
0,"Inym knew the siren, Fenon."
0,He was only one of many who had grown suspicious of the girl Zose brought into Ib’nua.
0,"She heard the rumors of the new arrival when she returned, and after confirming the identity of the sender through the aviary manager with a promise to take the vital message to Jit, she knew her target."
0,"Of course, she neither told the manager the contents of the message nor inform Jit."
0,"She did not want the information to spread too far, only to those in whom she felt she could confide and would be willing to share the bounty."
0,Inym took a swig of her liquid meal.
0,"She could not approach too near because of the Habha, but she had a pixy keeping watch."
0,She and her three accomplices would not lose them.
0,"Even if they did, she still had insurance."
0,"Chapter 5 “Snuffing out Embers"""
1,“Benab!
0,"Kill that scout!” Thanysa hollered in a coarse voice, her chest still burning from the mud that had drowned her."
0,She hacked out the phlegm that clogged her throat.
0,She left the stone blade in the human scout beside her and spat into the grass.
0,"The phlegm was discolored, and specks of soil remained."
0,"Her body burned with a fever, its incessant complaint at the foreign matter lingering in her lungs."
0,"The water mages washed both Chloe and her out to the best of their ability, but both fine silt and sharp grains remained for her body to slowly work out."
0,Life magic could do little against fevers unrelated to sickness.
0,"The effects could be mitigated, but until the physical causes were removed, the fever would return."
0,Benab rushed ahead after the fleeing scout.
0,"It was far in the distance on the open field barely within eyesight of the one Thanysa killed, and that scout had barely been within eyesight of another that Benab killed not moments before."
0,"Worst off, there was a fourth that they could not reach."
0,Thanysa had never seen scouting tactics such as this: one scout within eyesight of two or more others to relay information using hand signals.
0,"The information traveled between the scouts as fast as sight, impossible to stop."
0,"Tolmyur set a net outside Revlan, and they were caught."
0,Thanysa sat in the yellowed grass awaiting the bad news.
0,"“I couldn’t kill him, and there were three more who saw his flight,” Benab reported upon his return."
0,As she feared.
0,“We must speed our flight.”
0,"“Lady Chloe cannot keep our current pace,” Benab protested."
0,"Chloe was worse off than Thanysa, lapsing in and out of consciousness from her high fever, which was odd for a fire mage of Chloe’s caliber."
0,"Her body had withstood far higher temperatures, but the heat was not connected to her ven."
0,It was biological and weakened her.
0,"She could not tolerate the fever, even if she was unable to feel the heat because of her fire affinity."
0,At least that was the explanation from Tyree.
0,“Would you rather Tolmyur catch us?” Thanysa asked.
0,“No army can move as fast as a small party.”
0,"“No, but individual platoons can."
0,"You are a hunter Benab, not a soldier."
0,An army can catch fleeing injured quite easily.”
0,"If the only injured were Thanysa with the endurance-crushing debilitation of her lungs and Tyree with her missing leg, their group could abandon them to flee faster, but Chloe could not walk."
0,"Even though everyone was sharing the burden of carrying Chloe, she was heavy, and they could not move faster than a brisk walk for too long."
0,"Soon, the path would grow more difficult once they reached the mountain pass."
0,"They had fled south and then east bordering the dense forest the dryads gathered around Revlan, past the Tolmyur Camp, and then north for a day."
0,"The road from Revlan to the wilderlands was near, and the pass through Nuanae was just beyond."
0,The mountains stood like a wall in an illusion of being so near due to their size but remained half a day away at pace.
0,The pass to Ib’nua was steep but the soil was packed.
0,"Their pace would slow, but so would their pursuers’."
0,Benab extended his hand and Thanysa clasped it.
0,She fought the burn of her lungs as they ran north back to Kiri and the others.
0,Justin did not know where Coby took Ceil.
0,Sammy did not give the Habha a location or direction.
0,Their only information came from a sprite’s order to Kiri to pursue Ceil north.
0,"With providence, Ceil was hiding or being sheltered in Ib’nua."

1,Tallon weaved with all haste through the trees surrounding Revlan.
0,The net of scouts General Bregon set when he arrived at Captain--now General--Byurk’s camp had succeeded in discovering a group of elfkind running north with abandon.
0,"They were not citizens of Revlan but soldiers, organized in their flight."
0,"They had a purpose, and each scout that relayed the message knew that passing this discovery to their commanders was of utmost importance."
0,Many of the trees closest to the north wall were uprooted by the massive vines that tore through the outer wall.
0,A group of soldiers stood guard on the thickest vine that their army had used to enter the city.
0,"“Urgent message for General Bregon,” Tallon shouted as he passed the group along the top of the vine."
0,He was glad that the scouts sent without the city were not the ones relaying the message.
0,"Although they too likely felt the tremors of the vines, most would not have seen the destruction of the city."
0,"The message had travelled to the camp, and Tallon was the fastest, so Lieutenant Mackrum ordered him to inform General Bregon."
0,"A day after the vines tore through the city, many of the vines smoldered in the flames that spread, choking the sky and darkening the city in an umber shade."
0,"The battle against the Thorn General’s army finished earlier that morning, and the city was currently being purged."
0,"From atop the vine, Tallon could see Tolmyur soldiers weaving like insects through the rubble killing the scattering residents."
0,The rubble trapped most of the residents in and prevented the remaining Revlan conscripts at the outer walls from entering to defend them.
0,He was glad not to be part of the massacre.
0,Tallon hated fighting and loathed to take a life.
0,Scouts never fought.
0,They were specifically ordered not to unless for personal survival.
0,This was why Tallon struggled so hard training to be fast.
0,"His tall, lanky body was ill-suited for combat anyway, at least in his mind."
0,Tallon climbed the shallow incline of the vine to the central district and entered through the broken northeast curtain wall.
1,General Bregon remained in the largest manor while General Byurk finished his campaign by personally leading the purge of the city.
0,The giant at the front door opened it when Tallon approached.
0,General Bregon stood in the center of the entry hall where tables were moved in to create a tactical base.
0,"A scalped ponytail was fastened to his waist, the incredible length of the hair wound into three long loops."
0,Tallon grimaced at the sight of such a gruesome trophy.
0,"“General Bregon, urgent report,” Tallon announced upon his approach."
0,"General Bregon looked up from the large, sprawled out fabric map of Vallen and the surrounding territories."
0,"It was beautifully made, likely something that hung somewhere in the manor."
0,"“Speak,” he ordered."
0,“A band of Revlan soldiers were spotted fleeing north towards the Nuanae pass.”
0,“Have you informed General Byurk of this?”
0,"“No, sir."
0,You are the superior officer.”
0,“I will hold you to secrecy in what I am about to tell you.
0,Inform no one but General Byurk.
0,Tell him the humans from the other world have fled after the widow into the wilderlands.
0,He is ordered to assemble a swift elite squad of fifty soldiers who could survive without support from our armies.
0,He will lead that squad personally in recompense for letting the widow escape.
0,Revlan is almost cleared.
0,His men will not need his command to complete their task.”
0,Shivers trickled down Tallon’s back.
0,"Bregon’s deep voice was calm, but the aura of his internal fury seeped throughout the room."
0,Tallon did not know the wife had escaped yet again.
0,The entire Vallen campaign began for the purpose of her capture.
0,"So many Tolmyurin soldiers died, some Tallon knew personally, and now the wife fled the Amelian Empire."
0,Were they planning to begin a war against the wilderlands next?
0,Did Commanding General Jethro even have enough soldiers this side of the Stollmuk Mountains to begin such a harrowing campaign into hostile lands where every inhabitant was combat-hardened by their own struggle for survival?
0,* * *
1,Byurk sent away the scout.
0,General Bregon was indeed angry.
0,It was by Byurk’s suggestion that General Bregon had halted the battle between the sides of the deep fissure to negotiate the widow’s surrender.
0,"While it was true that Byurk feared that the fairies might secret away the widow amid the conflict, he also wanted to offer her one final opportunity to end the genocide, because the stubborn fairies certainly would not surrender."
0,His bare feet crossed the rubble on the outer second tier of southwest Revlan.
0,A large vine had torn through the wall on its way to the forges and craftshops of the bottom tier before it snaked towards the central district.
0,"All life on the surface was extinguished--he and his men made certain of it--but because of the sections of wall and buildings that cascaded from the first tier, much of the second tier was buried."
0,"The city was full to bursting, and many had been crushed under the rubble, but there were also many pockets of air."
0,"Survivors without an earth affinity struggled to find escape, and there was no hope for them."
0,Byurk felt a small body moving in the stone deep beneath his feet.
0,He could not tell if it was a fairy or a child.
0,"The ven he used to search the stone pinpointed the precise location of the survivor, and he tapped his heel."
0,The body fell still from the spike that impaled it from above.
0,"At this point, a quick death was a mercy for the trapped."
0,"Lieutenant Soppet relished in the destruction of the fairies, but Byurk didn’t."
0,"So much of Tolmyur directed their hatred to all elfkind in the Amelian Empire, but the ancestral hatred was not between Tolmyur and elfkind but between humans and elves, at least until the Coastal War that drew all Tolmyur into the conflict."
0,The minums’ ancestors did not originate from the ancient territory the Amelian Empire occupied.
0,"They were from the verdant strip in northern Tolmyur between the swamplands of the north and the endless deserts of the south, and that was where they had always lived until this day."
0,"The giants were coastal-dwelling seamen living along the southern and eastern coasts of the desert, and like the minums, they had resided there since ancient history."
0,"The dwarves perhaps had reason to hate elfkind, because they once shared the Stollmuk range with the golems, and by providing passage as the humans fled their homeland, the dwarves were branded as enemies and forced eastward to the already dwarven-controlled foothills of Stollmuk along the desert and verdant strip."
0,"The minums took in the human refugees and let them settle the deserts, providing aid where possible until they officially accepted them as part of the Tolmyur Kingdom along with the partially displaced dwarves."
0,The giants did not join until thousands of years later.
0,"The elves drove the humans out, not the trolls, not the spriggans or sirens or fairies or pixies or sprites or dryads or any other race of elfkind."
0,The Amelian Empire was not established until after the elves drove out the humans and unified the other elfkind under their banner.
0,"Byurk followed through with the genocide because Jethro had ordered it, but it still left a bitter taste in his mouth."
0,"Although the fairies were a member of the Amelian Empire and racial cousins of the elves, they were innocent of those ancient crimes."
0,"Byurk estimated that there could only be a couple tens of thousands of fairies remaining on the continent, and like he had warned the widow before the assault on Revlan, fairies will surely go extinct as they are absorbed into the other races, being biologically compatible with nearly every race of elfkind, nymphs and dryads aside."
0,"“I want to involve the wilderlands even less,” Byurk mumbled to himself."
0,"Jethro was from the wilderlands, or at least from the time he arrived on Whinhlem."
0,"He would never order an attack on those who dwelled there, many who also disliked the Amelian Empire."
0,"Although the races of Tolmyur were not openly welcomed, they were tolerated in the wilderlands, which was why humans quite often tried to flee there."
0,"With enough effort, they could secure a life in the wilds far better than they could in the barren desert."
0,At least two of the humans from the other world would not be with the widow.
0,The impossibly powerful fire mage fell to her death into the bottomless fissure.
0,"Another of those humans, the one who controlled the Habha, was killed by General Bregon."
0,That only left the time mage Byurk failed to kill even in his best efforts.
0,"He was Byurk’s sole hindrance, that and finding the widow."
0,Hopefully the bounty led others to capture or kill her for him.
0,"Even without Jethro, he could pay the bounty by taking those seeking to claim it to Amel personally."
0,More chasing…
0,Byurk sighed with a deeply rooted mental exhaustion.
0,* * *
1,"Now that Zose left with Ceil, Basara could no longer send him out to run errands."
0,"She had stockpiled enough for the six or seven days he would be gone to exterminate the Lurr, but now those supplies were running thin."
0,She would need to trudge through the city.
0,"Ib’nua was arguably one of the best cities in the wilderlands, but much of it was still filthy."
0,"Both Sen’uon and the Afarit were larger and cleaner, but Sen’uon was no place to raise a family, and the Afarit would not let her set up permanent residence after she already left it to become a hunter mercenary."
0,The Afarit did not view highly those who took lives for profit.
0,"Ib’nua snaked through the mounded hills, but not every valley was equal in elevation."
0,The lower sectors were horrendously muddy and would often flood when the snow first melted.
0,The wooden structures were refurbished every year because of this.
0,"Only the residences avoid damage, being built up the sides of the hills."
0,The tops of the hills were spared construction and used for much needed orchards and other edible plants to help feed the populous.
0,"The valley Basara and Zose bought their home on sat higher in elevation, so it would never come near to flooding and was far less muddy."
0,"But still, it was filthy."
0,“Watch your sister while I am gone.
0,I won’t be long.”
1,Basara grabbed her purse of silver shards and walked barefoot into the muddy street.
0,"Each step of her feet flash-dried the mud, sending steam out in her wake and hardening the ground like baked clay in a kiln."
0,Those on the street heading the same direction neared Basara enough to bask in her radiant warmth to ward off the cold but not close enough that their own footsteps in the mud would splatter her pristinely white nymph gown.
0,"The few small flecks of mud that did speckle her gown dried instantly and flaked off, but a small mark of dust remained."
0,The city both respected and feared Basara.
0,"If someone drenched her in mud, no one doubted the city would burn."
0,"Flour, legumes, and root vegetables, the only vegetables that survived storage over the long winters, could be bought without traversing the muddier sections of Ib’nua, but she had run out of winter’s staple food, meat, and the butchery was in the worse section of town."
0,Worst meaning dirtiest.
0,The mud was deepest there.
0,"The butchery never flooded in the snowmelt because it too sat just high enough up the hillside, but the valley beneath it had a small running stream year-round."
0,"There was no bridge over the stream there--the villagers just walked through the shallow water and mud--so she made certain to cross in a finer, cleaner, part of town so that she could be on the correct side when the mud ran deep."
0,"The amount of steam that spread with each of Basara’s steps on the softer, deeper mud greatly increased, creating a trail of fog behind her."
0,The smell grew foul enough to wrinkle her nose.
0,"Refuse often pooled where the mud was deepest, and in addition, there were a few dark red streams trickling from the butchery."
0,The butchers let the blood and filth of their product drain into the mud and stream to be washed away.
1,"On Basara’s way up the slick, muddy slope, a young shop-hand left the building carrying a bucket that sloshed of liquid waste from the slaughter."
0,"He was part spriggan from his budding horns but too short, possibly half fairy."
0,A spriggan’s senses were keen and could be used to detect when meat was growing foul long before any other race could.
0,"His legs were slightly deformed, common for half spriggans due to the difference in bone structure."
0,"Spriggans were quite fast and agile, but the curse of a half-spriggan prevented them from ever running."
0,Many could only limp and shuffle around lacking the ability to match a normal walking pace.
0,At least the boy appeared to have one working knee.
0,"Basara did not recognize him, possibly a new hire or apprentice."
0,"The butcher was a spriggan, so perhaps the boy was her relative, a grandchild maybe, now old enough to be put to work."
0,"The shop-hand struggled under the weight of his bucket and tipped it, spilling its crimson waste down the slope."
0,"Before the bucket could empty, the boy’s stiff leg slipped in the slick mud, sending him and his half-emptied bucket down the hill into Basara."
0,"His back collided with Basara’s legs, bucket and all, and she immediately dropped her heat."
0,The boy cried out.
0,He was badly burnt; his tunic fused to his back where it touched her legs.
0,Those who saw feared not for the boy but for themselves and fled.
0,"The elderly butcher, Habail, peaked out the door and frightened."
0,She agilely slid down the mud to Basara and the boy.
0,"“I am terribly sorry,” she pleaded, pulling the boy away and staring at Basara’s now bloody and muddied gown."
0,"“No matter,” Basara assured her, but her heart raced in her chest, and she struggled to keep her heat from flaring out of control in her temper."
0,"Like when Ceil tried to flee and Coby blew her and her daughters to the ground, she had to remind herself that no harm was meant."
0,This was only an accident.
0,“He’s hurt.”
0,“We deal with mud and bloodstains all the time.
0,"I can clean your gown,” Habail continued, ignoring Basara’s assurance that she was not angry."
0,"It was clear to all that she was, no matter how hard Basara tried to hide it."
0,“It will be as white as it was when you first wove it.”
0,"Seeing her fellow villagers fear her to such a degree hurt, but Basara understood why."
0,It was the fate of a maenad’s temperament.
0,More than a few times Basara had injured someone in Ib’nua who triggered her temper.
0,Twice she had even killed: a fairy who attempted to burglarize her home and a troll who thought he could take advantage of a nymph’s hyperactive libido to sleep with her despite her claims that she was committed to her husband alone.
0,"His argument of, “You cannot become pregnant from me, so your husband will never know,” was enough for her to bathe him in fire."
0,"Unfortunately for him, he had an earth affinity and could not endure the heat."
0,"“I will accept your offer, but first take him to a healer so his burns will not grow infected.” Basara wanted to pay for the treatment, but she knew Habail would not accept."
0,“His health is more important than my gown.” She had enough of her hair stored away to weave two more full gowns anyway.
0,"Her hair did not grow as fast as a full-blooded nymph’s, but it grew fast enough."
0,Habail thanked Basara and carried the boy off.
0,Buying meat would have to wait for another day.
0,"Basara did not want to walk around town in a filthy gown, so she decided to return home."
1,"As she neared the southern side of town where the bridge across the stream was located, noisy commotion filled the air."
0,"The sound bustled of curiosity, not conflict, so Basara chose to ignore it, at least until she saw the heads of armored elves over the crowd."
0,Vallen armor.
0,"There was only one reason Vallen soldiers would be in Ib’nua, and that reason had left for the Afarit two days ago."
0,"When those at the back of the crowd noticed Basara, they gave room for her to walk to the front of the crowd."
0,"If she wanted to see the procession, there were none in Ib’nua who would deny her."
0,"Most of the procession was dressed in Vallen armor, but there was only one fairy, a woman with regal demeanor who led the group through the streets."
0,"It was the most bizarre group Basara had seen, even in the wilderlands."
0,"There were two trolls, four elves, a spriggan, a fairy, three Melian dryads, an oread carried in a stretcher, and strangest of all, a blond-haired and fair-skinned human who should be their enemy."
0,He was not bound but in the center of the group beside the oread as if the group was protecting them.
0,"The oread’s hair was not vibrant, so perhaps the woman was like Basara, half human."
0,Basara rushed back out of the crowd and circled around ahead of the group.
0,"The mud had little time to dry in her hastened steps, so her feet and the hem of her gown dirtied, much to her annoyance, but she could not slow down."
0,The noble fairy was leading them directly to the commerce building.
0,"They sought information, but Basara could not let them inform the brokers that Ceil was in the wilderlands."
0,"Most the city would have known about the girl Zose brought, and those at the commerce hall would make the connection."
0,"She could trust Jit with her life, but that trust did not extend to those who worked for him or dealt business on his property."
0,"She slowed and walked out ahead of the group, steam in her wake, and stood in the middle of the road to block their path."
0,"The onlookers grew nervous, especially seeing Basara’s dirtied appearance, and many of them fled."
1,The fairy’s eyes narrowed then widened.
0,"“Basara,” she said."
0,Basara was not surprised this noble fairy knew of her.
0,"Maenads were rare this far south, and to her knowledge, there was only one who became renown, her."
0,"“Come,” she ordered and turned to walk down an adjacent path, diverging from the fairy’s course."
0,She did not look back at the fairy to see if she would follow.
0,She soon heard the march continue after her.
0,Basara stopped the party ahead of her doorway.
0,"“Choose a select few of you to enter to speak with me, but know that no mud is allowed in my home."
0,I have blankets for cover.”
0,The fairy did not question Basara’s instructions.
0,She looked over her party.
0,"“Chloe, can you walk?”"
0,"“Yes,” the oread spoke weakly."
0,"“And Justin, Thanysa, and myself."
0,"The rest of you, wait here.”"
0,"“I want to come too,” one of the young Melians, an anthousai, protested."
0,"“Ib’nua homes are burrows and caves, you will not be comfortable."
0,Stay here.” The fairy gave no further room for argument.
0,The male troll lifted Chloe off the stretcher and set her down at the doorway.
0,"Her clothes were clear of mud, having been carried by the stretcher."
0,"The female troll entered with her, the human next, and then the fairy."
0,Basara entered last.
0,“Did you kill someone?” Dana stood in the opening to the inner home and stared confusedly at the new guests and the dried blood on her mother’s gown.
0,"“Retrieve blankets,” Basara ordered."
0,Her daughter disappeared into the house.
0,"Her guests removed their dirty armor, footwear, and leggings, wrapping themselves in the blankets Basara handed them."
1,Dana led each to their place in the cushioned top room to sit.
0,"Without care for the sole man in the group, Basara removed her gown in the entryway and donned a new one Dana brought her, pristinely white, calming the anxious drum of Basara’s heart."
0,She tossed the soiled gown on one of the many racks.
0,"If it could not be cleaned as promised, she would have to weave another."
0,Basara joined the group and sat with her back facing the stairway.
0,Dana had done well sitting their guests against the wall but not in the corners.
0,"She even set the fairy in the correct position at the head, directly across from where Basara would sit."
0,Authority determined sitting positions.
0,"The troll, clearly a warrior or guard, sat against the wall adjacent to Basara in the lowest guest position."
0,"The human sat on the fairy’s left, the second highest, and the oread on the right, the third."
0,"Basara, the host, sat without a cushion at her back and Dana beside her."
0,"Emal, still too young to mind manners, found Chloe’s lap."
0,"This was the first oread the girl had seen outside her family, so curiosity took over."
0,"“Mother, I think she’s sick,” the young girl said, looking up worriedly into Chloe’s pale face."
0,Chloe looked pleased to have Emal in her lap and held her tightly with a smile.
0,"If Chloe was ill, it had to be something the Melians with them could not cure, something either genetic or foreign to the biological body."
0,"The fairy formally introduced herself as Kiri, the Chief Advisor of Vallen, and named the three accompanying her."
0,"“May I request our discussions be in Elven,” Kiri asked, well knowing that Basara invited her into her home to relay information vital to them."
0,She directed her hands at the two beside her.
0,"“These two are limited in what they can understand here, and Elven is their better language.”"
0,"As Basara expected, the oread was at least part human and likely not from the Amelian Empire."
0,“I can translate for them into whatever Tolmyurin tongue they are most comfortable.”
0,"“They are not of Tolmyur,” Kiri replied, solving another curiosity."
0,"“Unless you can speak the language of Fiorrae, of the sprites, Elven is all else they know.”"
0,The two must be uneducated to only know two languages.
0,"Even at a year old, Dana spoke six, and Emal was currently growing accustomed to her third."
0,“Understood.
0,"We will speak in Elven,” Basara replied, changing from the Vallen tongue of the Gallanvale to Elven."
0,"“First, I must know why you have come to the wilderlands.”"
0,“We are searching for a kin of mine who fled the destruction of Revlan.”
0,Basara’s eyes fell to the diamond pattern in the very center of the carpet.
0,She was not aware the genocide found Revlan and that the city fell.
0,That news had not yet reached Ib’nua.
0,The noble fairy race fell to Jethro’s vengeance when they were unconnected to the source of his wrath.
0,"As she feared, Jethro fell into madness, and her heart ached for him."
0,"“You seek Ceil, the widow of Emperor Yuro.”"
0,"Kiri’s eyes glanced to Thanysa who kept her calm demeanor, but Basara’s experience as a hunter mercenary caught the subtle change in tension in Thanysa’s hands."
0,The troll was readying an attack depending on how the discussion continued.
0,"“Thanysa, I will not tolerate hostility in my home."
0,I am a maenad.
0,"To not test me,” Basara warned."
0,Dana shook her head lightly in caution to Thanysa and Kiri.
0,She would know her mother’s temper best.
0,Thanysa’s hands relaxed.
0,"“I mention Ceil because she was here in my home not two days ago,” Basara continued."
0,“My husband found her in the pass.
0,He now takes her to the Afarit to supplicate Bydrofe for aid against Jethro’s armies.”
0,"Basara told of the short time Ceil was with her family and their agreement to help her end the war, using as much detail as she could to convince her guests that this was not a fabrication and that her family was indeed aiding her."
0,Kiri’s face grew a mixture of surprise and relief.
0,"She recounted the events of the fall of Revlan, including how Sammy sacrificed her life to save Ceil and send her to the wilderlands."
0,"She was glad that even after the fall of Vallen, Ceil had not given up hope, but Basara knew the truth."
0,Ceil was not acting out of hope but desperation.
0,"The girl was broken inside, and if her pleas to Bydrofe fell on deaf ears, she would not recover."
0,"Basara’s worst fear was the creation of another Jethro, a monster of vengeance."
0,"“If Ceil is headed for the Afarit and Bydrofe, then we must follow, but Ib’nua is all I know of the wilderlands."
0,Can we hire you as our guide?” Kiri asked.
0,"“I am retired, fairy."
0,My daughters are my employment now.”
0,"“You have shown that you care about our struggle, and I cannot trust another to take us,” Kiri pleaded, now on her knees."
0,Basara looked at Dana beside her and then an Emal playing unknown hand games she learned from Chloe during the discussions.
0,"Dana was nearly an adult, and she could be trusted to take care of Emal."
0,She was not worried on her daughters’ account.
0,What worried her was that something might happen to the home she created with Zose.
0,"True, Ib’nua feared her, but within that fear there were several people who hated her and wished she had not moved to Ib’nua."
0,The anonymity of actions taken in her absence may embolden the few.
0,"However, the war spread beyond the race of Jethro’s ire and destroyed the fairies."
0,Now it spread into the wilderlands.
0,"If she continued to ignore it, how long would she have before it came to Ib’nua and destroyed her home?"
0,Would Zose and her daughters be safe?
0,Would Jethro recognize and remember her?
0,Would he even care enough about their history to spare her after she and her husband chose to aid his target?
0,The fire in Basara flickered.
0,It was aggravating.
0,"The moment Zose discovered Ceil, she felt that fate was forcing her involvement, drawing her back to the past she left behind."
0,"The fate of the maenads was to lose control, of their emotions, of their actions, of their lives and livelihoods."
0,"Even being half-maenad, that fate clung to her, and she fought it every day."
0,Basara struggled so hard to create the life she now lived.
0,Maenads never lived among other races.
0,Most lived in isolation or in small covens far in the barren north so that they would not be a danger to others.
0,"The fire inside Basara flared, heating the room."
0,Dana quickly stood and knelt in front of Kiri.
0,“Basara already declined.
0,"Do not pressure her.” Dana’s words were a warning, not to protect Kiri and the other guests but to protect Basara from her own emotions."
0,"Basara understood this, and the quick action of her daughter helped Basara regain composure."
0,"Basara felt she had three choices: try to end Jethro’s destruction, wait for Jethro’s destruction to reach the life she built, or flee with her family and throw away all she had built."
0,"Awaiting destruction was a non-option, even if there was the possibility of the war not heavily affecting the wilderlands."
0,"If it did, it would be too late."
0,"Likewise, fleeing was not an option because Basara felt that the war could drown the entire continent if Jethro was willing to eliminate an entire race for harboring a single person."
0,"If the continent was to be engulfed in war, where would she flee with her family?"
0,"The rest of the world was controlled by the beastkin, and they despised both humankind and elfkind alike."
0,"Her only choice was to stop Jethro, but deep in her heart she did not want to be involved."
0,That was why she wanted Ceil to supplicate Bydrofe to intervene for her.
0,She knew why Jethro suffered and what drove him mad.
0,"She knew, and because she knew, she understood that had the same happened to her and her family, she would have gone mad or worse."
0,She was a maenad.
0,It would have been much worse.
0,"But perhaps because she knew, she was the only one who could stop him."
0,"If not by words, she might be the only person powerful enough to kill him."
0,The room cooled.
0,“I will guide you.”
1,"Basara held Emal as she marched through the commerce hall with Dana matching each step on the hot, baked mud Basara left behind."
0,The few monetary exchanges being conducted in the back halted when Basara entered.
0,She was an odd face here.
0,Zose was always the one to collect on contracts or make loans or deposits.
0,"“Jit, a word,” Basara called out."
0,An elderly pixy flitted over to Basara and waved for her to follow to a back room for privacy.
0,"If Basara, not Zose, was visiting with her daughters, he feared something dire had happened."
0,"“I have a request,” Basara began once seated."
0,"Emal remained in her lap, and Dana stood beside her as if a partner in business."
0,"Inside the home, Dana played like any child, but when guests visited or when outside, she acted mature, an imitation of the mother she admired."
0,“A contract has fallen into my hands that cannot be ignored.
0,"Zose is out on another, so I need my daughters cared for.”"
0,Jit flew over to Emal and tousled her hair.
0,"In front of Basara and Zose’s daughters he was not a businessman but their godfather, one to whom both Zose and Basara had agreed to leave their daughters should something happen."
0,"In the worst-case outcome, that may be the future awaiting them."
0,"“How long will I be watching them,” Jit asked, already agreeing to their care."
0,He did not ask for payment.
0,"This was a family request, not a business transaction."
0,“I cannot say.
0,Perhaps Zose will return before me.” Basara lifted and turned Emal to face her on her lap.
0,"“While you are staying with Grandpa Jit, finish learning your numbers and arithmetic."
0,You will find no better teacher.
0,"And Dana,” Basara continued, looking to her eldest standing beside her, “work enough for both you and your sister."
0,I am sure Jit could use another hand at the scales or tables.
0,"Now, take your sister upstairs.”"
0,Dana extended her hand and led Emal through a door leading to the stairway to Jit’s home buried deep within the hill.
0,"Basara forgot to tell her daughters she loved them, but they knew."
0,"“I will seal up my home when I leave, but keep an eye on it.” Basara breathed deep and exhaled slowly."
0,"“Jit, in not too many days there may be an army from Tolmyur marching north from Vallen."
0,Do not hinder them.
0,Send them north to the Afarit.”
0,Jit sat cross-legged on the table in consternation.
0,His face twisted into a frown that soon melted into worry.
0,"“Your contract, it is mercenary work.”"
0,“It is.
0,"Emal is still too young to understand, but Dana knows, as well as the possibility that I might not return."
0,She is a year wiser than her appearance.”
0,“I thought you gave up mercenary work after you left Tolmyur.”
0,"“So did I… But, this is connected to what I left unfinished back then.”"
0,"“Do not tell me that this contract is your own,” Jit spoke slowly out of both worry and pity."
0,Basara could not answer.
0,* * *
1,Jit flew out of his commerce hall with haste after instructing Dana to take Emal and hide deep in his home.
0,Two days.
0,That was how long Basara’s forewarned army took to arrive at the southern entrance to Ib’nua.
0,"When Basara had said in not too many days, Jit had assumed ten times as long at minimum."
0,"For this army of fifty or so strong to arrive so quickly, this was no search operation or platoon sent out to scout information."
0,This was a pursuit party.
0,Jit had a hunch.
0,A lot of information reached his ears in his commerce center.
0,"Zose left with a young elf woman after sending an urgent message, a message whose contents never made it to his ears by the usual secret channels."
0,Basara left shortly thereafter with Vallen soldiers.
0,Now the arrival of Tolmyur proved that Zose and Basara were involved with the missing widow of Emperor Yuro.
0,That was who Zose was escorting north.
1,The company was composed primarily of humans and a few giants dressed in light leather for mobility.
0,"A minum led the group, his expression discontent as he stood at the front staring down into the city whose populous would not permit them to pass."
0,"Dirm, an elderly fairy merchant who alone could nearly compete with Jit in wealth, had rallied the citizens to turn back the army."
0,"She stood arguing with Nythem, an elderly troll and retired hunter mercenary, one of the most influential people in the city."
0,"Nythem was advising Dirm not to make enemies of Tolmyur, but Dirm would not yield."
0,She had family in Vallen that she lost during the early days of the campaign.
0,"Their argument prompted a messenger to summon Jit to break the contest of opinions, he being the third of the influential heads of Ib’nua."
0,"“To the skies with your fairy pride, Dirm,” Jit chastised, fluttering in front of Dirm’s face and breaking up the argument."
0,"“Do you not realize that if you turn them away, they will only come back with a greater force?”"
0,“We are not a nation.
0,"How can we hope to face them when all of Vallen fell,” Nythem finished."
0,“We are decided.
0,You are the minority.”
0,"“Nythem, calm the people while I talk to the commander."
0,"I have the information he seeks,” Jit said."
0,"“Your information networks are a blessing, Jit."
0,"Come,” Nythem ordered Dirm with a nudge of his shin to her hip."
0,"Dirm drew a dagger and swiped at his leg, but the knife of an old fairy would never touch one who spent most his life as a hunter mercenary, even in Nythem’s withered years."
0,“Touch me again and I will remove your leg at the knee.” She glared back at the minum commander before returning with Nythem to the gathered populous.
1,"“I apologize for the commotion, commander of Tolmyur,” Jit said as greeting to the patient minum."
0,"“We do not mean any hostility to you or yours, despite appearances."
0,"I assume you know, but the wilderlands are a rough territory, and so its people are just as rough."
0,Expect the same at any city you find in your pursuits and know they do not mean harm.” Jit bowed.
0,"“I am Jit, money lender and exchanger of Ib’nua.”"
0,“I know the wilds all too well.
0,I was a hunter mercenary in my younger years.
0,I am General Byurk of Tolmyur.
0,We are here in pursuit of--”
0,"“Do not speak further,” Jit interrupted, angering the soldiers listening intently to the discussion."
0,"Their hands reached for their blades, which Jit found comical."
0,They must have quite the confidence in their skill to strike down a pixie.
0,"“I mean no offence, General Byurk."
0,You do not know where hidden ears may be located here in the wilds.
0,I want to avoid unnecessary conflict in Ib’nua.
0,I know why you are here and carry a message for you.”
0,General Byurk’s expression immediately improved.
0,“Speak.”
0,“Head north to the Afarit.”
0,Byurk’s lips curled back into a frown.
0,"“Is that all to the message,” he asked after swallowing his annoyance."
0,"“I can guarantee its credibility, as well as the credibility of the sender who requested I inform you when you arrived.”"
0,"“Who is the sender,” he asked in return, his eyes not accepting silence as an answer."
0,“You will likely meet her if you travel north.”
0,"Jit did not speak further to protect those who are living in Ib’nua, especially Dana and Emal."
0,The general could understand the “she” as being the widow or the identity of the sender or perhaps that they were both one and the same.
0,It did not matter.
0,“Keep to the main road as you pass through Ib’nua.
0,"Few will bother you, but do not expect a welcome here."
0,"Go north,” Jit repeated as he flew off."
0,"He prayed that Basara and Zose would survive this, and deep down he was livid that they involved themselves in something as dangerous as a war when they had a family."
0,Mercenary work was the job of those without a home to return to.
0,Basara should know this.
0,She retired immediately when she started a family and even forbade Zose from mercenary work.
0,“What are you two thinking?”

Chapter 6
“Decisions Made in Secret”
Miriam
"
1,"Back on Earth, Miriam was fighting desperately for her life."
0,A blade broke through her hastily conjured stone baton with ease and collided with the side of her face.
0,The blade slid across the side of her head to her cheek and flicked off the edge of her jaw.
0,"If her body wasn’t reinforced with earth magic, she did not doubt that the sharp stone would have cut deep into her skull, killing her instantly."
0,"Even with Eydis’s skill in life magic, Miriam could not be raised from the dead."
0,She grabbed the wrist of her opponent’s outstretched arm.
0,"Ven surged through her core, enhanced through the orientation of the wellpoints of her groin to her stomach, right breast and shoulder, and then extending down her right arm into the fist that struck her opponent’s side."
0,The wave recoiled through her system numbing her arm up to her shoulder.
0,Only about half the force passed to her target.
0,"Her opponent was not only reinforced like her, but she knew the stances to counter the ven of her strike."
0,Miriam received just as much damage as she dealt.
0,A second blade ran into her stomach.
0,"It did not penetrate, but the force of the impact nearly made her vomit again."
0,She had twice already during the fight.
0,Another thrust and Miriam was forced to release her grip.
0,"The two blades, now free, returned in a flurry of strikes at her stomach, chest, and forearms as she desperately fought to block her face."
0,"The blades could not cut her nor would they leave a bruise so long as her ven lasted, but each strike hurt nearly as much as if they had cut."
0,Her nerves reacted to the strikes all the same.
0,"Miriam could feel the onset of shivers, the signs of her ven running low."
0,"Again, she couldn’t last the entire session."
0,"One final kick to her stomach, and Miriam was sent tumbling over the mat."
0,"She sprawled on her back, momentarily lacking the energy to stand."
0,“You fail again.” Symra extended her hand to Miriam who clasped it and rose to her shaking legs.
0,"Meanwhile, two sanitation personnel quickly entered the arena to clean the vomit and sterilized the mat."
0,“This is your sixth failure.
0,"You are barred from advancement exams for…” Symra paused to calculate the time by Earth’s reckoning, “two months and fourteen days."
0,Use that time to improve yourself.”
0,"“Damn, I thought I could do it this time,” Miriam grumbled."
0,“Are you still against giving me some pointers?”
0,“You are a yeth in fourth.
0,Advancement to nenin in first must be done through your own efforts.
0,It is a mountain one must climb alone.
0,"There are many whose practice ends here, but you have potential."
0,I trust you will overcome it.”
0,“You don’t show any mercy.
1,"Makes me nervous for my advancement examination,” one of the observers mused."
0,“That blow to the head would have killed me.”
0,"“It most certainly would have, Alexander, but you are not an earth mage as she is."
0,"Advancement examinations must be as close to true combat as possible, or they are meaningless."
0,"At its core, this art is meant to kill, but I will be using blunt weaponry for you."
0,"Even so, permanent injury is always a possibility."
0,"Come.”
Miriam walked off the mat and raised her hand."
0,Alexander swatted it lightly as he passed.
0,"“Good luck,” she said before standing beside the remaining three observers and rinsing her mouth out with her water bottle."
0,"She had grown accustomed to the taste of her own sick over these intense matches, something she would never admit to anyone, but there was one person who would notice the taste or smell, Sean."
0,"“Does Symra ever tire,” Kim asked, one of Eydis’s former students from the self-defense class."
0,Miriam had tried to contact as many of Eydis’s students as possible as potential candidates for the government’s secret magic lessons.
0,"Some of them died in the attack on Gullivan, most refused to get involved, and in the end only Kim agreed to join."
0,“Must be something about being a Mountain Elf.
0,"If not, she is just far more fit than us,” Miriam replied while watching Alexander, a former Navy SEAL, hit the mat after only a few seconds of sparring."
0,"He was one of the few hand-selected military personnel who were found to have an affinity, water."
0,"Barring any use of ven or wellpoints, he could spar with Symra nearly as her equal, but without handicaps he was nothing more than a punching bag."
0,"He was a bem in fourth, the degree below Miriam and attempting to become a yeth."
0,Yeth was only the second rank.
0,Each rank had four stages before one could attempt advancement to the next rank.
0,"Advancement was terribly difficult, involving staged death-matches."
0,"On Whinhlem, such matches were no cause for concern due to life magic."
0,"Symra explained that the pain of combat was an important teacher, and the fear of death was a barrier to overcome quickly."
0,"But she was going easier on them because life magic was not accessible on Earth, and Earth’s medical capabilities were “primitive” by Symra’s assessment."
0,Miriam could not believe that Eydis endured such extreme training despite being the first princess and heir to the Amelian Empire.
0,"Eydis was a lin, two ranks above Miriam and four below Symra."
0,"“Has Symra told you the name of the art,” Thomas asked."
0,"This was his first day as a student, but instead of instruction, he was ordered to observe the two scheduled advancement matches."
0,"“Alex said it reminded him a little of Kali, but it is still rather different.”"
0,"“It has a name, but no one is ever taught it,” Miriam replied."
0,"“Apparently, once you reach avein, the highest rank, you will know its name without being told."
0,"I think that knowledge is actually required in order to reach that rank,” she elaborated, recalling what the Sylph had told her when she asked about the rankings."
0,The Sylph seemed to have knowledge not only about Earth but also Whinhlem.
0,"Regrettably, even the Sylph would not give her feedback to help her improve and become a nenin."
0,"“Is Symra an avein,” the final observer, Paul, asked."
0,Miriam shook her head.
0,"“No, Symra is stuck just below it."
0,"There was no living avein on Whinhlem that she knew about, so perhaps she is skilled enough to be one but she herself does not feel she is.”"
0,"“You pass,” Symra announced."
0,"In the short span of their conversation, Alex had turned his initial defeat at the beginning of the match into a victory, at least a victory matching the level of his advancement."
0,"This was his first attempt when Miriam had taken five, almost locking her into a two month ban on advancement examinations, and now she was not the only yeth."
0,"She felt slightly disheartened because of his rate of advancement, but he had also trained in other martial arts and only needed to learn to control his ven and utilize ven wellpoints."
0,"Miriam was his superior in that aspect, but she did not doubt he would catch up before long."
0,Miriam smirked to herself thinking about how much he would struggle advancing to nenin.
0,"Wellpoints were the focus of that particular advancement, and the higher the rank, the more ven and wellpoints were integrated into combat."
0,"If she was struggling this much, he would struggle even more."
0,Symra led the battered man to the edge of the mat and stood before Thomas.
0,“What are your opinions?
0,Do you want to begin training after what you have seen?”
0,"“Yes sir,” he replied promptly."
0,Symra’s eyes narrowed.
0,“I am asking you personally.
0,Do you want to learn?”
0,"“It is not a matter of wanting, I have been ordered to.”"
0,Symra shook her head.
0,"“Even among the palace guard, one must willfully choose to learn."
0,"If it is by order, I refuse to teach you."
0,"Let us leave.” Symra patted Miriam’s shoulder, beckoning her to follow."
0,"“That is all for today,” she told the military officers who stood on the balcony observing."
0,The soldiers manning the cameras and other recording devices quickly began dismantling their equipment.
0,"“You do realize that the reason you have so few students is because you always make them watch you try to kill me,” Miriam said with a smirk."
0,“It’s almost the same as asking if they want you to kill them.
0,The military keeps pleading for you to teach more of them.”
0,"“I understand that they are trying to increase their might by combining knowledge from both our worlds, but this art is dangerous if learned through conscription."
0,"The basics can be taught to anyone, as Her Highness has taught in your former self-defense class, but advancement requires immense willpower and drive."
0,"Without a strong will, skills learned in later ranks can debilitate the user."
0,Your own world’s martial skills are sufficient enough to contend against yeth on their own.
0,"If one does not desire to learn it, they should master this world’s arts instead."
0,"Your world’s power is not in ven or martial skill but in its technology, is it not?"
0,"Perhaps you can improve with magic, and we have no shortage of magic students, but no matter how hard you train, your bodies will remain weaker compared to humans from Whinhlem."
0,You should focus instead on advancing your technology.
0,Tolmyur could never compete against it.”
0,“But Jethro’s magic can.”
0,"“Jethro is only one man, and there is only so much one man can do alone."
0,"I firmly believe that even if he employed the same tactics he used to conquer Amel, he would ultimately fail in your world.”"
0,"“Teleporting an army into a city…” Miriam recalled the attack on Gullivan that resulted in over 5000 deaths including Sammy, Chloe, and Justin, lives that she still felt she could have saved if she foresaw the events of the invasion better, even though the Sylph assured her that nothing would have changed the outcome."
0,"From Symra’s account, the number of soldiers Jethro sent into Amel was many magnitudes larger than the thousand he used to attack Gullivan, and the army appeared within the city, not on the edges to fight their way in."
0,"If he sent multiple hundreds of thousands into Gullivan, the entire city would have been destroyed before the Army had time to respond."
0,"Nothing was stopping Jethro from attacking again, and the doppelganger of Eydis once warned that Jethro would destroy city after city looking for Eydis, so Miriam could not feel at ease no matter how much confidence Symra had in Earth’s technology."
0,“You were only caught unawares.
0,That is all.
0,"It will be different next time if your military truly is the best in this world,” Symra assured Miriam, noticing her unease."
0,"“I must speak with the commanders, so you are free to return home."
0,Rest up.
0,"Your ven is depleted, and you do not want to grow ill from your weakened state.”"
0,“Will you be discussing the fate of Oyak and Borgrum again?”
0,“Yes.
0,"Eydis is pushing for execution, and I agree."
0,Your nation’s aversion to capital punishment is dangerous.
0,We are running out of time.
0,"Once Oyak’s waning health claims her, nothing will stop Borgrum from rampaging.”"
0,“You can add my agreement in your discussions if it helps.”
0,“I will mention it.”
1,Miriam parted from Symra at the end of the hallway where two National Guard personnel waited.
0,She watched their backs as they walked away to wherever the secret meeting would be held.
0,"Symra acted unaffected, but she was well aware that she was being watched with nearly the same scrutiny as Oyak and Borgrum."
0,"Symra and Eydis were not imprisoned, but Symra was required to have an armed military escort wherever she went."
0,The escort was not for her protection.
0,She was very capable on her own.
0,"It was to subdue her or even eliminate her if she showed any sign of hostility, and Symra understood this."
0,"Miriam was also included in the military’s list of accepted escorts, of which Miriam was grateful."
0,It at least meant that Symra could be at ease some of the time without suspicion breathing down her neck constantly.
0,Miriam left the seemingly unremarkable building into the Washington D.C. night and walked along the sidewalk with others who were completely oblivious to the otherworldly lessons in the building they passed.
0,The world was slowly changing in secret.
0,"Magic was real, and another world was now in contact with Earth, but this was not known to those she passed."
0,"Chill was beginning to return to the air as the seasons changed, but it was not strong enough for Miriam to require a jacket, especially after the intense struggle of her advancement match that still made her sweat."
0,She took the nearest subway and stood silently in the corner of her car until her stop.
0,Moments when she was alone to herself were important.
0,"If her mind was too active on other things, she often found hearing the Sylph difficult."
0,"Although the Sylph could appear in front of her and converse with her if needed, most communication came through messages in her mind, often as quiet as a whisper."
0,The Sylph was the north wind.
0,She had responsibilities elsewhere and could not be with Miriam at all times.
0,Miriam did not want to miss any warnings or hints of danger.
0,"She was Earth’s oracle, the only one who could hear the Sylph’s prophesies of the future."
0,"The condo provided for Miriam and Sean was certainly not high class, but it was also not decrepit."
0,They were lower-middle-class condos owned by the government where the military was able to promise security for Sean and her.
0,"All the tenants were government employees, and most worked for the Pentagon or another federal agency."
0,"They had to pay rent like any other, but the price was reasonable enough for what the Pentagon paid them, considering both she and Sean worked."
0,"Sean was Eydis’s secretary and the go-between for communications between Eydis and any other government agencies, mostly to filter the information to leave out any mention of top-secret topics when communicating with those outside proper clearance."
0,"After the press conference where Eydis directly told the world about her identity as an elf and that the invasions would continue, the government no longer trusted Eydis to withhold sensitive information."
0,He was also involved with a taskforce trying to track Eydis’s doppelganger.
0,There was a lot the Department of Defense placed and Sean’s plate.
0,"By comparison, Miriam’s jobs only involved helping Symra with magic and combat training as well as acting as Eydis’s caretaker."
1,Miriam entered the door code for the complex and walked towards the elevator.
0,"The ride was brief, only to the second of four floors, and her walk to her door was just as brief being right beside the elevator."
0,"She fumbled in her purse for the key with fingers that still shook from her advancement exam, but the door opened first."
0,"“Figured that was you,” Sean said with a faint smile."
0,"“Heard the elevator.” He held the door open for Miriam to pass, and she kissed him lightly on the lips as she did."
0,She was glad she remembered to wash her mouth out this time.
0,“How’d it go?”
0,"“Failed again,” Miriam sighed."
0,“Can’t try again for two and a half months.
0,It’s frustrating.
0,"Symra won’t let me help instruct until I become a nenin, so I’m getting paid to just be a student."
0,Doesn’t feel right.”
0,Sean closed the door and followed Miriam to the living room.
0,“You are still complaining about that?
0,Job training is part of any employment.
0,And you are taking care of Eydis.
0,It’s not like I’m doing a whole lot myself now that the doppelganger’s trail has gone cold.”
0,He watched Miriam set her purse on the back of the dining table against the wall with a shaking hand.
0,“I put dinner in the fridge.
0,I can heat it up for you before you shower.”
0,A small smile curled on the side of Miriam’s lips.
0,"“I’m not all that hungry, and we can take a shower after."
0,I used too much ven today and could use a recharge.”
0,Sean shook his head lightly.
0,“Am I just your charging station?”
0,"“More like a portable power bank,” Miriam quipped while latching onto his arm."
0,"“You don’t use your ven, and it takes me three days to fully recover mine on my own.”"
0,"“Why not ask Eydis,” Sean suggested, returning Miriam’s smirk with a downward glance."
0,Miriam released his arm and skipped away a step.
0,"“While I’ll admit that I would love to try it at least once, I am not a lesbian.”"
0,"Sean sighed, exasperated."
0,“I meant asking her to simply give you some of her ven.
0,She could recharge you ten times over.”
0,Miriam giggled.
0,“Are you complaining?
0,She could recharge you ten times over.”
0,At least we are at home this time.”
0,Sean reached over and grabbed Miriam by the arm.
0,She shrieked playfully as he pulled her down onto the couch.
0,“I used to be such an upright person before I met you.”
0,“You mean stuck up?
0,I know.”
0,* * *
1,Miriam awoke in her bed with no recollection of how she got there.
0,"She couldn’t remember if she had fallen asleep during or after sex, and she hoped it wasn’t during."
0,"That had happened more than just a few times since dating Sean, and it was quite a blow to any man’s self-esteem, but it certainly wasn’t Sean’s fault."
0,"He knew exactly how to please her due to how often she requested a “recharge.” Conversion of natural ven to earth ven was physically taxing, and she had exhausted her available ven during her advancement exam, converting all of it, so she was rather exhausted."
0,"After assessing her ven level, it was lower than expected."
0,"Had she lasted longer, it would have been higher."
0,"She once told him that he could continue if she fell asleep, but he refused."
0,He was not the type of man who would enjoy sex with a sleeping woman.
0,Miriam looked at Sean sleeping peacefully beside her.
0,He would sleep in for a while longer.
0,"“I’ll have to apologize again,” she whispered to herself."
0,"She kissed Sean lightly on the forehead and slid out of bed, walking naked across the room to the main bathroom for the shower she missed the evening before."
0,The condo had two bathrooms and three bedrooms total.
0,"It was meant for a family, so it was a bit large for the two of them, but Eydis refused to live with them."
0,"At least they had room for children should they ever come, but Miriam had no immediate plans for them."
0,"She didn’t want any--not yet--and she had not been with Sean for long, but the only preventative measure they were using was her birth control pills."
0,Condoms blocked ven transfer by preventing the contact of the well points that facilitated it.
0,"Pills weren’t 100% effective, so Miriam reasoned that if she did get pregnant, that was nature telling her it was time."
0,"She would need an heir to the position of Earth’s oracle eventually anyway, and if she was being honest with herself, that responsibility was the sole reason she would ever consider having children."
0,"Miriam dressed quickly, donned light but professional makeup, and headed out the door."
0,She dropped by a convenience store before heading to the subway and picked up breakfast for two.
1,"Miriam knocked on the door to Eydis’s private office in the Pentagon, but she did not expect an answer."
0,It was simply out of courtesy.
0,"After all, this office was Eydis’s home for the time being."
0,"She unlocked and entered the dark room, flipping on the light and locking the door behind her."
0,There were no windows to the hallways like many of the other private offices.
0,"There had been windows, but they were removed and replaced with noise-cancelling walls."
0,"Much of what was openly discussed in this room should not be heard by the average employee, high security clearance or not."
0,"“I brought breakfast,” Miriam announced, but the blanket on the couch did not stir."
0,She set the two plastic cases on the desk.
0,“I have a garden sandwich and a sausage and egg muffin.
0,Which one do you want?”
0,Miriam walked over to the loveseat and peeled back the blanket.
0,Eydis was curled into a ball with her knees to her chest.
0,"She was six and a half feet tall, and the loveseat was only about four feet wide, hardly long enough for her to rest comfortably across let alone sleep on."
0,Eydis’s eyes were open but stared at nothing.
0,"She wasn’t asleep, and from the shade under her eyes, she slept little."
0,"“If you keep not sleeping, I will have no choice but to make you use one of our rooms."
0,We have a bed already set up for you.”
0,"“I made Justin sleep on the couch for months, did I not?” Eydis said in a tired voice."
0,"“This is a loveseat, not a couch."
0,The couch in his apartment was wider and Justin was much shorter than you.
0,How much did you sleep?”
0,“About two hours.
0,Maybe three.”
0,Miriam sighed.
0,“It is no problem.
0,Your days are much shorter on Earth.
0,I spent most my life staying awake longer.”
0,"“But your nights were also longer, so you slept more."
0,Dr. Hengen told you to get a full night’s sleep every night or you won’t recover.”
0,“She knows nothing of elven biology.”
0,Miriam pulled Eydis to sit up and walked over to retrieve the two plastic cases.
0,"“She’s a psychologist, and I don’t think our minds work all that different."
0,Which one?” She held the selection in front of Eydis.
0,"Normally Eydis would choose the garden sandwich, but this time Eydis selected the other."
0,Miriam was relieved because the sausage and egg muffin was far more filling.
0,Eydis did not eat yesterday.
0,“Did you at least do your memory exercises last night while I was training with Symra?”
0,"“They hurt, so no,” Eydis replied flatly."
0,"“You do realize that your headaches mean that you are unwell and need to continue your treatment, right?"
0,Recalling your past should not cause physical pain.”
0,"“I know my past,” Eydis retorted after swallowing a small bite of her English muffin."
0,"“I only lack the fine details, and I can do without those."
0,"I remember Sammy, Chloe, you, Sean, and everyone else now."
0,I am no different than I was before I was captured.”
0,"“Eydis FeAmel is following a dark path that will see to her ruin and the loss of many lives,” the Sylph had warned Miriam about Eydis."
0,“She must return to how she once was if we are to survive the coming calamity.”
0,The disaster that befell Gullivan was only the beginning.
0,"Something worse, something the Sylph called a calamity was coming."
0,"As Earth’s oracle, Miriam was tasked with preventing disaster."
0,"The only warning she had received was about Eydis, so she needed to put all her effort into helping her recover."
0,"So far, Sean was the only one she had revealed the prophesy to, and his suggestion was to help Eydis with her memory loss and make sure she continued meeting with Dr. Hengen, the military psychiatrist selected by the government for her specialization in PTSD and combat-related head trauma."
0,"Miriam thought that a memory-loss specialist would be best, but Eydis was coping with far more than just memory-loss."
0,"She was imprisoned and abused by her doppelganger, only recovering just in time to watch her best friend and the man she loved be killed in such a gruesome manner that there was nothing left of them but a shower of gore."
0,"Eydis was clearly still unwell, shown by her lingering and strong guilt, lack of appetite, unstable emotions, insomnia, and the list went on."
0,"Miriam was sure that if Sean had also been caught in Jethro’s blast, she would not be as calm as she was now, although she too was seeing a psychiatrist weekly."
0,She attributed Sean and her mental fortitude to both being even-tempered and logically minded.
0,"Sean appeared least affected by the disaster on the outside, but Miriam knew he was handling it a little worse than her."
0,His nightmares persisted longer and talk of war made him tense.
0,"He was skilled at hiding his emotions, so she was probably the only one who noticed."
0,"“Did you pass,” Eydis asked after another bite."
0,Miriam chuckled.
0,"Not even a month ago, Eydis failed to care about the daily lives of others, even her friends, so her question was a sign of recovery."
0,Or it could have been simple curiosity due to having gone through the same advancement process at some point in the past.
0,She sat down next to Eydis on the loveseat and cracked open the thin plastic casing of her sandwich.
0,“I am barred from advancement for two and a half months.”
0,Eydis nodded lightly.
0,“It took me over twenty tries to advance to nenin.”
0,The garden sandwich froze an inch from Miriam’s mouth.
0,"“You’re joking.” If an elf trained in magic from childhood took over twenty attempts to pass, how long would it take someone with not a year’s worth of education and practice?"
0,"“I was also the human equivalent to 13 or 14 years old, so my own immaturity had much to do with it."
0,"Symra speaks highly of you, so you should not take as long."
0,She had nothing but criticism for me.”
0,“Why did you decide to train in such a dangerous martial style?
0,I would have thought that they wouldn’t want to put the heir to the throne in danger.”
0,“I didn’t decide.
0,"My father made me,” Eydis said with a mild scowl."
0,“Symra said that study had to be voluntary.”
0,"“Normally that is the case, but it was an order from the emperor, so neither Symra nor I could refuse."
0,My reluctance was part of the reason she was so critical.
0,"Once Symra realized I could no longer advance because my heart was not in it, she demanded that my father end my training."
0,"She almost lost her position and standing because of that, but the unanimous voices of both the council and officers of the guard convinced him against it."
0,"“My father… he was rather paranoid, almost manic, about some things."
0,"As I got older, he began acting stranger and stranger."
0,"He accelerated my education, but I did not mind."
0,I enjoy study.
0,He forced me to train with the elite guard under Symra when I hated fighting.
0,He took a young child to wife and silenced any who protested.
0,The only time my father ever struck me was when I complained to him after seeing how terrified Ceil was about her situation in the palace.
0,He even made me supply blood for creation of that doppelganger knowing well how dangerous it would be.”
0,"Eydis stared down at her half-eaten muffin, her mind drowning in her memories."
0,She had not been so vocal since before the doppelganger captured her.
0,Her downcast gaze hidden partly behind her disheveled hair made Miriam’s chest tighten.
0,There was sadness and longing in her eyes.
0,"Eydis’s father was dead, as was her mother and her brothers."
0,"Thinking logically, much of what her father did was for Eydis’s protection."
0,"She learned how to fight, and the doppelganger was meant as a body double."
0,No doubt he had done more of which Eydis was unaware.
0,"She was alive now because of her father’s paranoia, although creating a doppelganger had backfired."
0,“Have you heard of the decision from last night’s meeting?” Eydis looked at Miriam through the strands of her hair hanging over her face.
0,"Her expression was calm, but a seething flame burned behind her eyes."
0,“Sean should be bringing the decision when he comes later today.
0,"For now, finish your breakfast, and I’ll take you to the public showers so you can get cleaned up.”"
0,* * *
1,Eydis stood in the cold water of the shower.
0,"The room was open and well ventilated, but heavy steam was still problematic for Eydis’s breathing."
0,"At least close to sea-level, the air was not as thin as in Gullivan."
0,The chill of the water helped calm the anger burning inside but did not extinguish it.
0,It still smoldered with the thoughts of every person Eydis loved that was killed because of Jethro and Tolmyur.
0,Yesterday was the fourth time the government of this country had discussed the fate of the two Tolmyur officers captured during the attack on Gullivan.
0,"Each time they had decided to further postpone execution, claiming that they may still be of use and citing their peaceful demeanor."
0,She leaned against the cement wall with her forehead resting in her arms.
0,The cold water cascaded down her back and ran as a thin stream from the tip of her tail that slowly grew numb from the chill.
0,"If this government continues to let them live, I will have Symra execute them on behalf of the Amelian Empire."
0,Every single human of Tolmyur needed to be eradicated before they could kill anyone else.

“Those Left Behind”
Fect
"
1,"Fect swirled the gin in his glass lightly, the single rock of ice clanking against the sides."
0,"His coworkers from the garage were shouting in drunken revelry already, and their night at the bar had only just begun; a bunch of lightweights, but then again, most people on Earth were from what Fect could see from the other tables."
0,They were celebrating Fect’s quick promotion to senior welder after only two months of working.
0,By chance he had walked by a maintenance welding shop as he trudged through some run-down town and noticed a small torch from the open shopfront.
0,Its flame bore striking similarity to the magic Jethro had taught him using a combination of wind and fire magic.
0,"The gas flame was not as hot, so it did not cut the metal but fused it together."
0,One of the shop hands noticed Fect watching their work from the road and called him over.
0,They were surprised by his stature just as much as he was of their work.
0,"They knew he was not a child because he let his beard grow out over the months of directionless wandering after being swept down the river away from the battle at Gullivan, his facial hair growing fuller than any of the men in the garage."
0,"Fect asked if he could try their shop-work, and they humored him, giving simple explanations once they realized that his English was poor and that he could not understand Spanish either."
0,"Fect picked up the skill almost immediately, and the supervisor hired him on the spot not caring that he lacked identification."
0,"Then again, another employee at that garage also lacked identification, so that did not seem to be an issue for them."
0,Fect hopped off the bar stool he used instead of a chair at his table for the added height and walked to the bar counter for a refill.
0,His coworkers did not seem to mind his absence despite him being the reason for the trip to the bar.
0,They were only looking for another excuse to go out drinking.
0,"Fect was glad to have some employment so he could legally purchase food and other necessities instead of utilizing his concealment magic to steal it, but at the same time he found it hard to feel at home here."
0,"The garage welcomed him, but he did not feel welcome, perhaps because he came to this world as an invading soldier, killing their people."
0,"He was their enemy, and try as he might, he could not remove that wedge driven between accepting a new life in this world and knowing that at any moment he could be discovered by this nation’s government and executed."
0,"He was a captain of Tolmyur’s armies, not some maintenance welder, and so long as that remained true, those laughing back at the table speaking unintelligible babble in some unknown language could never truly become his comrades."
0,Fect felt alone.
1,"“You have stronger than gin,” he asked once sitting atop a barstool at the counter, determined to get drunk."
0,"“For a small guy, you can throw it back,” the bartender praised."
0,“You have a preference?
0,"Vodka, whiskey, rum?”"
0,“Strongest.”
0,"The bartender nodded and grabbed a bottle near the top of one of the back shelves and showed it to Fect, but Fect could not read the label."
0,"“This Bacardi is a bit more expensive, but it’ll knock you flat."
0,How would you like it?”
0,“The bottle.” Fect patted the counter.
0,“It’ll taste like gasoline.
0,How about this.
0,"If you want rum, I’ll give you a Kryptonite.” The bartender grabbed two more bottles of rum from behind the counter."
0,"He added spiced rum, coconut rum, and then gently poured pineapple juice and melon liqueur, finally topping it with the Bacardi."
0,"Fect eyed the odd green drink and then downed it without so much as a slight reaction, much to the surprise of the bartender."
0,"It was far better than the gin, not only in flavor but also because of the burn he sought, different from a flame."
0,"Fire mages often struggled getting drunk because alcohol tricked their bodies into thinking that they were in distress, making them convert raw ven to fire ven naturally to fight that distress and burn off most the alcohol, so strong drink was always needed."
0,“You like it?” the bartender asked.
0,“Leave the bottles.
0,"I will pay,” Fect replied."
0,"The bartender did as asked, expecting to come back to the small man knocked out on the counter."
0,"In this small-town bar, no one would criticize him for allowing a customer to let loose."
0,"So long as the customer did not go overboard, no harm done."
0,"Fect mixed the drink skillfully as he had seen and downed two more glasses, finally noticing the light buzz of drunkenness."
0,"As he was pouring his fourth, the bottle of spiced rum slipped from his hand, but he promptly righted it before too much spilled."
0,It did not slip from his drunkenness.
0,The television in the corner of the bar displayed two familiar faces on the screen.
0,"The first was General Oyak, and the second was unmistakably a giant."
0,"Subtitles displayed on the screen, but Fect could not read this country’s language."
0,He waved over the bartender again to turn up the television.
0,The bartender immediately complied and raised the volume to max.
0,"The moment the news on the television sounded over the revelry, many people grew attentive, some far too attentive, glaring at the screen."
0,"It became clear to Fect that most people in this country had great interest in the attack on one of their cities and those involved, an attack that he took part in."
0,His feelings were not wrong.
0,These people were not his comrades.
0,"“Where is Carswell,” Fect asked the bartender, feigning only mild interest."
0,“The FMC?
0,"It’s in Fort Worth, about two hundred miles south of here.” The bartender rattled on about his uncle’s family that lived in Fort Worth, and his opinions of the attack and how his family thinks the government should just torture information out of them or execute them to appease the people."
0,"All the while Fect listened to the brief news segment until it ended, the volume of the television was turned down, and everyone returned to their revelry."
0,"Fect paid his bill in cash, leaving extra for the bartender’s service."
0,He then left without his coworkers noticing he was gone.
0,These people were not his comrades.
0,Two of his actual comrades were trapped in this world like him but imprisoned.
0,Fect was a captain of Tolmyur.
0,He had the responsibility to free them.
0,* * *
1,Walking to Fort Worth took six days.
0,"Having abandoned his short employment, he carried only his clothes, provisions, and a fair amount of this country’s paper currency in his backpack."
0,Fect learned nothing about the prison complex other than its location.
0,He did not know where General Oyak or the giant was held in the complex or what security measures were present for their detainment.
0,"Someone of General Oyak’s skill could not be held easily, and a giant could overpower any human of this world with little effort, but they could not escape, or they would have already."
0,"General Oyak was one of the most loyal of the generals to Jethro, bordering religious fanaticism, so he was certain she had not struck a deal with their enemy."
0,Fect feared that their captors may have done something to them that would complicate the escape or make any attempt at escape impossible.
0,Two rows of high fence bordered most of the prison complex with bladed wire coiled about their lengths.
0,Two gated vehicle entrances on opposite sides gave access through the fences but were likewise just as guarded with the bladed wires.
0,"The wire was certainly to prevent climbing, but Fect could simply cut through without issue."
0,He only worried about the astounding surveillance powers of this world.
0,"He did not doubt he would be discovered if he did so, even if concealed using his magic."
0,"A public entrance sat at one side, but visitors were not regular."
0,"He could slip in with one of the employees of the complex using his concealment magic, but civilian buildings in the complex were not where he needed to go, and he doubted they would connect directly to the cells where the prisoners would be kept."
0,Good prisons had many levels of security between areas of civilian access and the deepest dungeons where the highest of security prisoners were kept.
0,General Oyak certainly fell into that category.
0,"He did not know if prisons in this world had dungeons, but regardless, he needed a more direct route."
0,"Fect observed the complex at a distance for three days while hiding in a rather unkempt plot of land containing abandoned shacks and dumped garbage, being careful to stay out of sight without his concealment magic active."
0,He did not want the complex to increase security if they noticed someone suspicious inspecting the perimeter.
0,"The outer perimeter beyond a third smaller, less defensible fence seemed to be public, but the two loiterers he saw over the three days were quickly met by security personnel and questioned before being sent on their way."
0,"Had he acted like a civilian as well, he would be unable to explain himself when questioned."
0,"Fect determined the actual prison within the complex rather quickly: a dull, multistory cement structure with small, uniform windows."
0,The grander structure beside it must have had a different purpose than housing prisoners.
0,He would check there last if his initial assumptions were wrong.
0,"While observing the far side on his fourth day, Fect happened to catch a vehicle passing through."
0,He felt this was his only chance.
0,"Fect scaled the low, outer fence with ease using his light weight in this world and approached the gate under the shroud of his concealment magic."
0,"The former blur of his magic caused by motion weakening the illusory effect was nearly imperceptible now due to his constant use and practice of the magic over the past months out of necessity, now no more visible than the waves of heat that can be seen atop sand baking in the desert sun."
0,It was still imperfect but far safer than before.
0,He only needed to be careful not to approach too near someone.
0,"The magic was not hot enough to burn instantly, but someone would surely feel the heat and grow suspicious."
0,"Fect slipped in through the first gate as it opened and crept slowly along with the vehicle, waiting as the guard and driver did business."
0,He then passed through the final gate.
0,"His concealment magic would not last too long, so he needed to either find somewhere to hide and meditate to recover his ven or locate his comrades quickly and escape."
0,Fect hurried to the prison structure and walked along the wall.
0,"The windows were far too high for him to reach, and they were closed, preventing him from listening in."
1,He noticed a group of four groundskeeping at the end of the structure.
0,One woman separated a little from the others as she picked up a scrap of paper that had been blown in by the wind.
0,"She sung a spirited tune, her arms and legs moving to the rhythm as she worked."
0,Fect quickly approached her before she could return to the group.
0,He needed information most of all.
0,"Now that he was inside, he had no idea where to go or what to do."
0,"“You have good voice,” Fect whispered without removing his invisible veil, testing the woman’s response."
0,"The woman’s song immediately ceased, and she looked around her in confusion."
0,“Do you know of Oyak?
0,"She is old woman here,” Fect asked next."
0,"“Oh, god,” the woman said, backing into nowhere as she continually changed directions looking for the origin of the unseen voice."
0,“Do you know Oyak?” Fect repeated.
0,"“Listen, I don’t want no trouble, you hear?” the woman said in a quiet voice, fearing that if she spoke up and alerted anyone, she would be in danger."
0,“Do you know location of Oyak and Borgrum?
0,"If you help, maybe I free you too,” Fect offered."
0,"Given that her attire was vastly different than that of the guards Fect had seen, he could only assume she was a prisoner."
0,“Free me?
0,"No, I am here for the hospital."
0,"I have this operation, and taxes will pay for it here,” she refused."
0,The woman’s reply was a startling revelation.
0,Fect set fire to a hospital in Gullivan where he was treated after he fell injured during the fight with Princess Eydis in their first failed attempt to capture her.
0,He was their prisoner and yet they treated him.
0,Did all medical facilities double as prisons?
0,"This meant that once again he would be attacking a hospital, a crime that would undoubtedly result in his execution if caught."
0,"For a moment, Fect reconsidered the possibility of returning to that small, forgotten town and continuing his life as a welder."
0,He was most likely thought dead along with the many other soldiers who fell in the assault on Gullivan.
0,General Oyak was certainly not expecting him to rescue her.
0,"Once he did rescue them, what then would he do?"
0,"He trusted that he could conceal them long enough to escape the facility, but giants did not exist on Earth."
0,"Small people did, allowing him to live somewhat normally aside from the initial surprise of people he encountered."
0,"“Tell me location of Oyak or I kill you,” Fect ordered."
0,He would see their condition and decide then whether the rescue was possible.
0,He still did not know why they allowed themselves to remain imprisoned.
0,"The woman did not know the exact location of Oyak, but she knew the name and the general location where the high security prisoners were kept."
0,"Fect sped across the grounds to what he believed was the hospital, the grand structure of quality build just to the north."
0,"General Oyak was not imprisoned there, but he needed a distraction large enough to clear whatever guards might be at the cells."
0,"If this instead increased security, his only other option was to blast and burn his way through."
0,"He ran by the windows, glancing in long enough for his sight-based fire magic to set each room alight with an intense fire not caring for who or what may be inside."
0,"Once he finished the length of the structure, the entire side of the hospital was ablaze with a billowing flame far too large to quell."
0,"The hospital in Gullivan had the means to suppress and control fire, so he did not want to take the chance that a small fire would die too quickly."
0,This structure needed to burn.
0,He then hastened to the location told him by the singing woman.
1,The sound of a battle could be heard from inside.
0,General Oyak and the giant must have noticed the commotion and realized this was their moment to escape.
0,"If that was the case, they might be healthy enough to flee."
0,"Fect blew open the entrance, killing any personnel or prisoners that met his gaze, and followed the noise of the conflict."
0,"After blowing open the final door, Fect saw the giant fighting a familiar troll in the hall."
0,She was the same troll who had escaped him in Gullivan during Jethro’s teleportation experiments.
0,The door to the cell where the giant had been confined was blown out and in a bent heap on the other side of the wall.
0,The giant protected the entrance from the troll.
0,General Oyak was likely still inside.
0,Fect rushed to assist.
0,Fect shot a beam of concentrated fire ven from his eyes at the troll.
0,"She conjured a slab of stone at her side the moment she felt the intense heat, and the slab exploded, showering her in shrapnel."
0,A black and blistering burn remained just below her ribs.
0,"The giant exploited the opening to land a powerful blow in her center, sending her into and through the cell door opposite them."
0,She quickly recovered without much damage.
0,"Instead, the giant’s arm fell limp and broken at his side."
0,"Fect heard rumors about the elven martial arts, but to rebound a blow as powerful as a giant’s felt to Fect like sorcery."
0,Such should not be possible.
0,Fect lit a wall of flame between the troll and giant.
0,"“We must escape,” he called, but the giant quickly signed the hand-signal for injured."
0,He was not referring to himself.
0,The reason why he had not escaped was because General Oyak could not.
0,"This was a hospital prison, and General Oyak was here for both confinement and treatment."
0,"If they wanted to escape, they needed to eliminate or at least incapacitate the troll."
0,The troll bounded through the flame only lightly singed and targeted Fect with two stone scimitars raised.
0,"Fect ignited a flame pillar in front of her approach, but she kicked out the stone beneath the floor, sending the pillar’s column erupting to the side."
0,The blades lowered for an execution.
0,"A powerfully thrown slab of concrete hit the troll’s arm, deflecting the blade enough for Fect to just barely dodge."
0,"The troll’s arm hung broken above the elbow, but the pain did not slow her assault."
0,"Fect erupted flames from his body, forcing the troll back, and then activated his concealment magic."
0,"Meanwhile, the giant charged and grappled the troll to the hot ground."
0,Fect was about to execute her when gunshots fired from the entrance.
0,Reinforcements arrived faster than Fect had expected.
0,The giant shielded his head.
0,One of the bullets hit his arm and the other landed in his side.
0,"Not a moment later, he was off the troll with her on his back and her good arm locked around his neck."
0,"A small stone knife appeared in her hand, and she swiftly ran it across his throat."
0,"Now with reinforcements and the only other combatant eliminated, Fect’s sole option was to flee."
0,"He ran in the shroud of his concealment magic to the other side of the hall, stopping briefly in front of the destroyed cell."
0,There he saw General Oyak on a hospital bed with a stone spike impaling both the bed and her from below.
0,She lived but was fading.
0,Her glazed eyes noticed the wavering air of Fect’s concealment magic.
0,"“Young Captain Fect, flee this place."
0,"You should not have come,” she said in a weak voice."
0,“Our death was inevitable.
0,Wait for Jethro to find you.
0,He will not abandon you in this world.”
1,"Light flashed behind Fect, and all fire in the hallway extinguished."
0,General Oyak’s eyes filled with tears.
0,"“I wondered where you were hiding,” spoke a familiar voice."
0,"Fect turned as multiple gunshots rang out, but none of the bullets reached Jethro."
0,His simple barrier deflected them away.
0,Fect saw that the giant was no longer in the hall.
0,The troll stood in front of the guards in a defensive stance.
0,"She would not forget the master of Tolmyur’s forces, nor his power."
0,"“Flee this place,” Fect heard the troll order quietly to the guards."
0,“Flee or you will die.”
0,"Jethro paid her no concern, and with a flick of his hand, General Oyak vanished next."
0,"“Fect,” he spoke jovially, “I had hoped beyond hope that you survived."
0,"You are far too crafty to die in battle.” He turned, patted Fect’s invisible head, and after shaking off the sting of the heat, walked towards the troll."
0,"“Symra, was it?”"
0,"“Flee,” the troll ordered again, this time shouting, and the guards fled with haste."
0,"Every step Jethro advanced, Symra receded back at even pace."
0,She dared not turn her back to him.
0,"“I had thought you would not be a nuisance if left in this world, but you surprise me,” Jethro laughed."
0,“I trust that you are here under order of Princess Eydis FeAmel?
0,I have a message for her.”
0,The troll’s eyes narrowed.
0,"“The Gods of this world have interfered with our feud, and so long as Eydis remains in this world, I am forbidden from touching her."
0,"Likewise, I do not doubt they would interfere with her should she decide to use this world’s power to attack me."
0,I give her a choice.
0,"Once my probation here is over, I can send her back to your world."
0,We can then kill each other at our leisure.
0,"If she decides to stay here, so be it, but once I am back on Whinhlem, I will use the full power of Tolmyur to eliminate the last member of the royal family, Ceil."
0,"They were as close as sisters, if I am not mistaken."
0,"If she wants to save that girl, she must accept my offer."
0,"If she chooses to remain in this world and abandon Ceil to death, know that if I ever discover the means to thwart the Gods of this world, I will return here and end her next.”"
0,Jethro eyed the troll who had escaped him once before and now stood before him after potentially killing two more of his commanders.
0,"“Fect, have your fire ready to cauterize two wounds,” he spoke quietly."
0,Fect readied his sight-based magic for whatever Jethro had in mind.
0,It happened in an instant.
0,"With only the slightest movement from Jethro, the troll’s left leg severed from just above the knee and right arm from just above the elbow."
0,"Fect immediately focused his gaze on the wounds, igniting them briefly."
0,"The troll fell to her back, writhing and howling in agony."
0,"Fect then set the severed arm and leg alight, preventing them from being reattached if life magic was used quickly."
0,"“Seek treatment from your princess, and do not forget to relay my message."
0,"Oh, and one last message for her.” Jethro’s joviality vanished, replaced with pure rancor."
0,“Remind her that she brought all this upon herself.”
1,"The hallway vanished, and Fect found himself in a cement room with pillars and high, barred windows."
0,Borgrum lay motionless on the floor having bled out from his neck.
0,General Oyak remained alive but waning.
0,Fect did not doubt she would soon pass.
0,"“My Lord, thank you for sparing a thought for this old woman."
0,I know young Captain Fect was your true aim.”
0,"“He was,” Jethro admitted."
0,“No one but him would think to set one of the higher security prisons in that nation ablaze.
0,"Had it been a lesser prison, it would not have made immediate international news.”"
0,"“You already knew General Oyak was there and where in the prison she was located,” Fect realized."
0,"“I did, and I have been in regular contact with them."
0,She and Lieutenant Borgrum chose to remain there instead of rescue because they could feed me information they glean from the periodic interrogations.
0,I must apologize for my past comments about you needing to focus more on cowardly tactics.
0,I only wished for your safety.
0,"You are a braver man than most, and you have proven that once again today.”"
0,Jethro knelt on the cold floor to look Fect level in the eyes.
0,"“Your father, Temmet, was a good friend of mine, the first companion I made after my hunter mercenary party arrived in Tolmyur."
0,You spent most your life living in the shadow of his accomplishments.
0,"I supported your military career in honor of his memory, but you are not your father."
0,"You are smarter, more cunning, and a fair bit more powerful.”"
0,Fect trembled.
0,"He was used to Jethro’s casual and amiable speech when they were alone together, but now Jethro’s tone had an air of seriousness that scared Fect."
0,“I have personally instructed you in magic.
0,I gave you dangerous missions to both test and train your wits and mettle.
0,Several of the top generals of Tolmyur are aware and have given their full support of my decision.”
0,General Oyak turned on her broken body and bowed her face to the blood-soaked cement floor.
0,She did not bow at Jethro but at both Fect and Jethro.
0,"As Fect stared at her in stunned silence, she drew her last breath, frozen in reverence."
0,Jethro directed Fect’s focus back to him.
0,"“You still require more mentoring and education, and I do not have any plans to give up my position just yet, but whether I die or become king, you will succeed me as Commanding General when that time comes.”"
0,* * *
1,Eydis sat in a single lone chair in the center of an unadorned room across from a table populated by five of the highest-ranking military officials of the country.
0,"She did not want to be here, and she could leave at any time she wanted with teleportation magic, but that would only worsen her current situation."
0,"Symra had called Eydis’s order to subvert the due processes of this world to execute the two Tolmyur prisoners foolishness, but Eydis ignored those sound warnings and ordered their execution on behalf of the Amelian Empire nonetheless."
0,"Now Symra was in critical condition, and the whereabouts of the prisoners were unknown."
0,"“We now know that Jethro is still hiding somewhere on Earth and cannot return to Whinhlem,” Eydis asserted, justifying her rash actions."
0,“At what cost?
0,"Knowing that Jethro is still here does not help us find him,” the man in the center of the table rebuked."
0,“He gave invitation for me to contact him.”
0,"“Will you take his offer, to use his magic to return to your world?” the official on the far left asked."
0,Eydis could read clearly the expressions of three of the officials.
0,They wanted her gone to remove the blade hovering over their country’s throat.
0,"“I would be returning on his terms, by his power."
0,"The moment I take such a deal, my life is forfeit."
0,The only reason I would agree would be to cross him and fight.”
0,“And do you believe we have any hope of capturing or killing him?”
0,"“Your technology is great, but your lack of understanding and ability in magic will be your downfall."
0,You cannot fight him.
0,None of us can.”
0,"“We have lost a valuable instructor due to your rash actions, one who could have helped us to that end,” the man in the center rebuked though his voice was calm."
0,“You only see Symra as a tool.”
0,"“As did you when you ordered that assassination,” rebuked another, not denying their exploitation of her skills."
0,Eydis steeled her expression.
0,"She did not regret her order, nor would she ever admit it was in error."
0,"She had to play to their fears, or they would not understand."
0,"“Had you done what I asked and executed those two long ago, the thirty-two people at that prison would not have died."
0,I did not set fire to that hospital.
0,"Someone from Tolmyur did, and only because there were prisoners in your custody whom they could rescue."
0,"You continually underestimate their abilities, and this is the result."
0,They assassinated my entire family in one night and dissolved my empire in half a month of your world’s time.
0,Do not think for a moment that they could not do the same to your country.”
0,The panel of officers behind the table fell silent.
0,"“If you are finished with me, I will leave.”"
0,"“Our decision has not changed,” the man in the center spoke as Eydis stood from her lone chair."
0,“Your privileges to information will be heavily restricted as will those of your friends.
0,You will work with Ms. Schruder to instruct both magic and combat in Symra’s place until her recovery finishes.”
0,"“Miriam is not sufficient rank to instruct,” Eydis reminded."
0,"“You are, and Miriam only needs one more advancement."
0,Get her that advancement immediately.”
0,"Eydis marched to the table and stood erect, glaring down at the sitting military officers."
0,“I am not yours to command.
0,I am working with you solely to fight a common enemy.
0,That is all.
0,"Miriam will not help instruct until she advances, and she is prohibited from advancement for two months."
0,I will see to Symra’s quick recovery.
0,"In the future, heed my warnings or expect more lives to be lost to your hubris.”"
0,Eydis turned and walked from the room.
0,"Chapter 8
“A Lurr Village”
"
1,"“How many are there,” Ceil asked from the center of the defensive perimeter."
0,"Zose, Jeddin, and Dyson stood guard around her in the deep snow nearly up to their waists."
0,Coby hovered nervously above.
0,"The flapping of his massive wings did not clear the snow on the ground around them because the top, sun-melted layer had frozen overnight."
0,"“Five at least, but that’s not the issue."
0,"We are in Lurr country now,” Dyson cautioned."
0,A snarled howl bellowed from deep inside the dense conifers a short distance away.
0,A second answered from the rising cliff behind them.
0,"“Regular wolves are not much of a threat unless you are alone, but Lurr are far more powerful."
0,"Mistake a Lurr for a regular wolf, and that will be the end of you.”"
0,"Ceil readied her hamadryad staff, now full length after her days of nurturing it."
0,"Aside from their initial ambush after setting off from Ib’nua, the seven days of travel had been uneventful."
0,"They stayed in a small hovel outside a run-down village two days ago to weather a blizzard passing through, covering the road in two to three feet of snow overnight, but that alone was the only hindrance of their journey north for the Afarit, until now."
0,Dyson noticed a light bulge in the snow from the edge of their perimeter between him and Zose.
0,"He yanked Ceil aside into Jeddin as a wolf lunged up from beneath the snow, nearly biting Ceil’s face."
0,His follow-up kick sent the beast tumbling into Zose who finished it with his twin bone knives.
0,Ceil shook off the impact of colliding with Jeddin and immediately grew cautious of the deep snow around her.
0,The frozen layer prevented her from seeing where the wolves would appear until just before the strike.
0,"“Don’t worry about the snow,” Jeddin said, pulling Ceil to her feet."
0,“That was an arrogant pup.
0,Wolves normally do not attack unless they are certain they can avoid pointless losses.”
0,That pup was a large as the palace hounds.
0,"If a pup was that large, how much larger were the grown wolves?"
0,"Coby flapped his wings sending two wide blades of wind into the thick trees, cutting three of them down."
0,"As the towering pines crashed to the ground, four massive wolves fled to the safety of the open roadside."
0,"They were much larger than her, large enough for their entire head and most of their back to rise above the deep snow."
0,"While three of them circled the road snarling, the largest of them receded, almost afraid."
0,"“The one in the back is a Lurr,” Zose cautioned, “but it does not seem a threat.”"
0,"“Two more from the cliff,” Jeddin announced, drawing his bow."
0,"“When I signal, go.”"
0,Ceil’s heart thundered in anticipation.
0,"She had fought predators in Fiorrae, including several the smaller Habha, but she had never personally fought anything this large."
0,“Now!”
0,"Jeddin loosed his arrow, striking the nearest wolf in the neck near the shoulder, but that alone was not enough to drop the beast."
0,It charged.
0,Jeddin had another arrow nocked and fired before it could approach.
0,It penetrated the beast’s open maw.
0,He stepped aside as it crashed past him next to Ceil.
0,"She slammed the butt of her staff into its writhing head, blackening its fur and killing it."
0,She then turned to the three charging from her back.
0,Two ran for Dyson and the third for Zose.
0,"Dyson was forced away, unable to challenge two at once."
0,Zose shallowly ran his blade across his opponent’s chest to deflect the beast aside.
0,"Ceil was exposed, but the Lurr receded further back, snarling directly at Ceil with its red eyes and its tail tucked between its legs."
0,Coby dove after the Lurr.
0,"With one massive flap if his wings, the snow blew away in a white cloud, and the Lurr tumbled back through the deep snow."
0,"It righted itself quickly and lunged, jumping an impossible height."
0,Its teeth sank into the flight feathers of Coby’s right wing and pulled him to the ground.
0,"“Coby!” Ceil ran after her friend, not wanting him to die protecting her."
0,"Even for a large Habha, a Lurr of that size was too powerful an opponent."
0,“Ceil!
0,"Don’t stray,” Zose called out after successfully running off his injured wolf."
0,The Lurr was about to carry the wildly fluttering Habha off but then noticed Ceil’s approach.
0,"It yipped in fear, releasing Coby’s wing, and frantically scurried away."
0,Ceil was not mistaken.
0,The Lurr was terrified of her.
1,"She ran to Coby and saw that only his feathers were damaged, not his wing, much to her relief."
0,"Zose quickly ran after Ceil to cover her against the other wolves, but when Ceil looked back, the other wolves were in retreat after their leader, the Lurr, fled."
0,"“What were you thinking,” Zose scolded, grabbing Ceil’s arm."
0,Ceil wrenched her arm free.
0,“Coby is all I have left!
0,I will not let him die while I yet breathe.”
0,"“Let it go,” Dyson said as he approached, wiping down the large scratch on his arm with an alcohol-soaked rag."
0,“Can Coby fly?”
0,Ceil straightened out Coby’s feathers to the best of her ability and repeated Dyson’s question to him in English.
0,Coby cried out and flapped his wings.
0,"He rose into the air unstable, but he could still fly."
0,"“You can ride my shoulders if flying with that wing tires you,” she told him while stroking his breast feathers after he landed."
0,Coby nipped playfully at her fingers in reply.
0,"“We are nearly at Hen’anin, an old fahil mining outpost."
0,"We can tend our wounds there,” Jeddin said after bleeding the two wolves they managed to kill."
0,“We should be able to sell these for their meat and pelts.”
0,Zose extended his hand to Ceil.
0,"He was still angry at her for leaving their protection, and she spent the next hour listening to him berate her for her foolishness."
0,He was her protector and she his charge.
0,"If she acted on her own, he could not fulfill his duty."
1,Hen’anin consisted of worn and dilapidated shacks set along the slope of a mountain.
0,"The tiered slope, clearly carved by hand, stood on the side of a massive pit further down the mountain, so deep that Ceil could not see the bottom from her angle."
0,"The pit itself, the fahil mine, was eroded and crumbling, showing several centuries of abandonment."
0,"Whatever fahil, and possibly resfahil, that may have been in that mine had long been extracted."
0,"Unlike Ib’nua, no ruins were present, at least that Ceil could see."
0,"The recent heavy snowfall had collapsed parts of weakened structures, and they were left in disrepair."
0,"The populous trudged with faces downcast through snow-packed streets, paying no attention to the new arrivals just entering town."
0,"The only people who walked through the city with confidence had the essence of a warrior about them, much like Zose, Jeddin, and Dyson, other hunter mercenaries here to seek contracts or simply passing through."
0,A woman of odd characteristics as if she was a mixed breed of many of the elfkind chanced a glance up at Ceil’s party as they passed and screamed.
0,"Her eyes flared red and locked onto Ceil, but as she stared, Ceil could not help but think the terrified woman looked not at her but through or past her to something behind."
0,"The woman scrambled to her nearby hut to get inside, tearing down the meager cloth covering the entry."
0,"Ceil stopped walking, startled by the sudden display."
0,Inside the hut she heard a crash and then sobbing.
0,"“Was that a Lurr,” Ceil asked, now worried and a bit scared herself."
0,"“Yes, but I do not know why she would be so scared,” Jeddin replied."
0,“Lurr here have no need to fear hunter mercenaries.”
0,“Are Lurr not dangerous?”
0,"“Bestial Lurr certainly are, but those who have fed solely on common folk enough to become one of us are able to live among us under certain conditions."
0,They abstain from uncooked meat to prevent further evolution and the interference of bestial instincts that may develop from the inclusion of that blood.”
0,"“It is those bestial tendencies that warp the mind and when combined with high intelligence create the possibility for the development of a chimera,” Zose explained."
0,A man who looked nearly elven carried a heavy sack across the road.
0,He glanced over at Ceil’s party and hollered.
0,He dropped his sack and scrambled in a panic to distance himself.
0,He tripped on the sloping road and slid over the packed snow.
0,"He collided with the support beam of a hut elevated against the slope, breaking it and sending the hut careening onto the road atop him and another resident."
0,"The terrified man broke free with ease and fled, but the other resident remained under the heap."
0,Nearby villagers hurried to unbury the poor victim caught in the collapse.
0,"Jeddin and Dyson rushed to their aid, but the astounding strength of a few of the villagers cleared the rubble with ease before they arrived, freeing the man as well as a woman and child who had been inside the hut."
0,Ceil and Zose approached the group slowly.
0,"Ceil wanted to apologize for the destruction, but as they neared, the eyes of three of the villagers flared up in deep crimson."
0,"Like the two before, they fled in a raving panic."
0,"In the distance out of sight somewhere down the sloped village, Ceil heard another crash."
0,The woman with her child looked up at Ceil and screamed.
0,"Instead of fleeing, she stood and shielded her child, her arms out and fingers rigid like claws, ready to attack Ceil if Ceil so much as took another step forward."
0,Zose drew his twin blades and stood in front of Ceil while Jeddin and Dyson tried to calm the woman who refused to be calmed.
0,“They are just like the wolf Lurr from before.
0,"She is scared of me,” Ceil realized."
0,"“Are you sure it’s not Coby,” Zose replied."
0,"“Habha are mostly unknown in these parts, especially one so large.”"
0,"The woman’s terrified crimson eyes continued staring into Ceil, not at Coby to her side."
0,"“If it was Coby, why are only the Lurr frightened?"
0,"It is me she fears, but why?”"
0,“Zose!
1,What have you done to these people?” A burly troll with a thick fur cloak and his coarse red mane of hair braided down his back marched over the road to stand between him and the mother.
0,"His height, not lacking compared to elf men, dwarfed Zose and made Ceil anxious."
0,She did not know if he was friend or foe.
0,"“We have done nothing,” Dyson assured from behind him, finally managing to turn the mother away with her child now that a powerful presence stood between her and the source of her fear."
0,"“Silence whelp,” the troll roared."
0,“The villagers would not have reason for such fear of Zose unless he had done something to them.”
0,"“I have not taken a red contract, if that’s what you mean,” Zose protested."
0,“I know as well as anyone that these Lurr are harmless.”
0,“And yet you brandish your blades against them.”
0,Zose sheathed his blades.
0,“I am under contract to protect this woman on her way to the Afarit.
0,The Lurr are only scared of her Habha companion.
0,"As her protector, I must draw my weapon against any who might mean harm, even if out of misplaced fear."
0,I am sure you understand.”
0,The troll’s gaze bore down on Ceil and then Coby beside her who rustled his wings in irritation.
0,"His feathers puffed up, making him appear slightly larger than he already was."
0,"Ceil stroked Coby’s head lightly to calm him down, but she was still anxious about the antagonistic man before them and the conversation she could not fully understand."
0,"“It’s all been a misunderstanding, Pyn,” Jeddin said as he dragged the two wolves over and thrust them in front of the troll."
0,"“We were planning on selling these to you, but take them for the village as apology for the commotion and damage we caused the people."
0,Two wolves should be more than enough to compensate for a single hut.”
0,"“Make it one wolf,” Dyson argued."
0,“We must still trade for supplies.”
0,"Pyn growled when Dyson spoke, but Dyson remained unperturbed."
0,He was used to the belittling treatment from other trolls who saw him as weak due to his thinner physique.
0,Pyn slung the larger wolf over his shoulder by the rope and bade everyone follow.
0,“Come.”
0,"“Have you seen that reaction with Lurr you have encountered before,” Zose asked quietly to Ceil after another Lurr in the village fled from them as they traveled to Pyn’s tavern."
0,Ceil was unsure if he believed her or if he was trying to find the truth in her suspicion.
0,"“I have never encountered a Lurr until now,” Ceil admitted."
0,“I thought they were a problem in your village.
0,You told me as such when we met.”
0,"“They were, or so the villagers told us."
0,"There was a sighting every few days, and about twice a season someone fell prey to them."
0,"But after my family moved there, never once had a Lurr approached the town that I can remember."
0,"The village thought it odd too, but at the same time a famine began that destroyed the land, so the lack of Lurr could be explained there.”"
0,"They had not traveled far before reaching a sturdier structure than most, the likely reason Pyn arrived after the commotion so quickly."
0,The foundation of the tavern was built of layered stone with slightly higher quality wood for the walls and shingling on the roof.
0,The shingling had been cleared of snow to remove the heavy weight.
0,"“Your habha waits outside,” Pyn ordered, breaking up Ceil and Zose’s conversation."
0,“I do not want it scaring the customers.”
0,"Ceil explained Pyn’s order to Coby, and he flapped briefly into the air to land on the roof, dislodging two loose shingles."
0,Pyn grunted in annoyance.
0,"Dyson and Jeddin entered first, but Ceil hesitated."
0,"If there were many Lurr in this village, there was sure to be some inside."
0,"Evening was approaching, and she could hear light commotion from the entryway."
0,“I will wait out here.”
0,Zose looked at Ceil’s worry-pained face.
0,“I would prefer you take this time to warm your feet and hands.
0,We have been traveling through snow for too long.” He placed his hand on her back and led her through the entry.
1,"A chair toppled on one side of the tavern, and a table tipped on the other, sending its earthenware dishes to the floor."
0,The thin spriggan who toppled his chair sprung out the nearby window.
0,"The other, a mix of different elfkind like the woman before, drew a hatchet from his belt and backed into a corner behind his table, brandishing it in fearful defense of his life."
0,“It is me!” Ceil protested.
0,"“What manner of woman are you escorting,” Pyn hollered."
0,He marched over to the Lurr in the corner.
0,"“What do you know of this woman,” he asked."
0,"“Let me out,” the man mumbled."
0,“Protect me from that thing.”
0,"Unsure of the reason and not wanting to cause a regular customer any more trouble, Pyn escorted the man to the door."
0,The three other patrons watched the scene from their tables with a mix of astonishment and confusion.
0,"Pyn then marched in irritation to the back and returned with a sack, tossing it into Dyson’s arms."
0,“Trade for the wolf pup.
0,"That should be enough, and I will not haggle."
0,Leave this city before that woman causes any more harm.
0,"She is not welcome here.” Unlike Pyn’s previous conversations with Zose, he spoke in elven so Ceil could understand."
0,Ceil’s heart sank.
0,"She knew that her very existence was a plague that killed anyone who associated with her, but even here deep in the wilderlands where her true identity was not known, people feared her and wanted her gone."
0,Her life was a sick joke.
0,Ceil wanted to collapse there on the ground and rot.
0,She slowly trudged out the door only to have another Lurr on the road run in fright.
0,"“Your hospitality is lacking from my last visit, Pynthos,” Zose sneered."
0,“Hen’anin has always cast out those who cannot coexist with the peaceful Lurr who live here.
0,I’m sure you understand.”
0,* * *
1,"“The Lurr are afraid of her?” Inym repeated back to Kep, a female pixie she employed to monitor Ceil."
0,Kep spun around Inym’s head once.
0,“Every single one who saw the girl either bared their fangs or fled at the sight of her.”
0,Inym walked past a pile of wood that had been a hut just the day before.
0,"As she walked, she spotted a similar pile just down the slope."
0,“We can use this.
0,There is a Lurr city Zose will likely have to pass through to reach the Afarit by the safest and quickest road.
0,Fly ahead and tell Deinan to stir up the Lurr there.
0,Warn them that an evil is approaching their city and should be eliminated at all cost.
0,They will know her when they see her.
0,I’ll investigate here.
0,"Once finished, head back to Zose’s party to continue observation.”"
0,Kep flashed an excited grin and shot like an arrow out of town.
0,Inym was amazed every time she saw Kep’s speed.
0,"Pixies with an affinity for wind were extremely common, but like all other pixie affinities, they could only practice manipulation."
0,"Those who could conjure wind were nearly unheard of, rarer than spatial pixies."
0,"Manipulating the wind around them made pixies extremely agile in flight, but add in the ability to conjure wind for propulsion, and a pixie was unmatched in the air."
0,"Kep was one such pixie, and her price was exorbitant."
0,"If the bounty on Ceil was anything less than a king’s bounty, Inym would never have been able to convince Kep to help without any payment upfront."
1,Inym pulled the leather curtain back from the entry of Pyn’s tavern and knocked on the sideboard.
0,"“Pyn, you here?”"
0,Pyn walked from the back room with his hands bloodied up to his elbows.
0,“Inym?
0,What brings you back to Hen’anin?
0,Have you finally settled somewhere?”
0,"“I’m living near Ib’nua, working for Jit.” Inym entered and leaned back against a table next to Pyn."
0,“Want breakfast?
0,Got my hands on a wolf pup yesterday.
0,The meat should be soft enough for you.”
0,Inym peeled back her cloak and lifted her thick fur armor to expose her midsection.
0,"A deep scar cut across her stomach and abdomen from the left, leaving a large chunk of flesh missing from her right side."
0,"Pyn already knew her scar from back when it was fresh, but he would not know just how emaciated she had become over time because of it."
0,Her stomach was sunken and both ribs and hip bones were pronounced.
0,“Can’t eat solid foods anymore.”
0,“By the god’s.
0,That is no way for a troll to live.” Pyn wiped his arms off on a rag he pulled from his waist and then slung the bloodied rag over his shoulders.
0,"“If I stew it for you, could you manage?"
0,No charge.”
0,"Inym smiled, and her drooping ears twitched lightly."
0,“I do not have the time.
0,I am on errand right now.
0,I am only here for information.
0,"From what I understand, you had a dangerous party pass through here yesterday, led by Zose.”"
0,“Aye.
0,Right made a mess of things.
0,Terrified every Lurr who saw them.”
0,“That same party caused havoc in Ib’nua as well.
0,Killed Fenon and Burdhu.”
0,"“Never cared for that shrewd siren, but I am sad to hear Burdhu is dead."
0,"Listen, if that party is as dangerous as you say, you should leave them be."
0,"Lurr are generally unshakable, given their strength and all, but that girl with Zose had them jumping right out my windows.” Pyn grabbed Inym’s arm, and he could feel the bone directly beneath her fur covering."
0,“Stay here.
0,I’ll take care of you.”
0,"Inym’s ears twitched again, and she peeled his fingers off her arm."
0,"“I was already run from this village after the incident, if you remember."
0,It was a Lurr that did this to me.
0,"I still can’t feel comfortable here, or I might have returned.”"
0,“Not any Lurr.
0,"It was a chimera, two of them.” Pyn corrected."
0,"“Very few could ever hope to fight two chimera and survive, let alone kill them both.”"
0,“All the same.
0,"Besides, if this job goes well, perhaps I can be the one saving you from this run-down village."
0,I need to know what scared the Lurr.
0,Do you know one I can ask?”
0,“Ask the spriggan next door.
0,"I’ll have soup for you when you finish,” Pyn said, returning to the back to continue his work."
0,Inym shook her head and then grabbed her ears.
0,"They wouldn’t stop twitching, and for sure Pyn noticed."
0,That was likely why he continued being so adamant about her staying.
0,Male trolls always competed for the best warrior women.
0,"Inym was certainly quite skilled among hunter mercenaries before her injury, but she felt he could do far better than the emaciated woman she had become."
0,Inym flicked her ears to stop them from twitching as she walked out of the tavern.
1,"The shack next door was shapelier than most, and the furs peaking from below the fabric covering the entrance hinted this Lurr was better off than many in Hen’anin."
0,She parted the fabric and patted the sideboard.
0,“May I enter?
0,I need information on the woman you saw in Pyn’s tavern.”
0,"A mound of furs stirred in the corner of the hut, and a face with glowing red eyes peeked out from below."
0,"Inym’s heart raced, and for a moment, she almost fled out the door despite herself."
0,"Even years after her subjugation of the two chimera, the mental scars remained just as clear as her physical ones."
0,"Inym’s body shook, but she forced herself to enter and kneel beside the fur mound."
0,“What did you see that frightened you so?” She suspected that this spriggan Lurr had not left his furs since he fled the tavern the day before.
0,"“That girl,” the Lurr hissed, “she has death about her."
0,Death is in her and stands behind her.”
0,“Death?
0,Surely no one here in the wilderlands is unacquainted with it.”
0,“No!
0,This is different!” The Lurr’s head shot out from under the furs.
0,His left antler caught and snapped off the corner of his forehead.
0,"Inym lunged back in fright and collided against the far wall, causing the sturdy hut to creak."
0,"“This is different,” the Lurr repeated, ignoring his broken antler and the blood leaking down his face onto the furs."
0,“Death emanates from her and poisons the ven in the air.
0,The earth blackens where she steps.”
0,"The Lurr’s fears sounded like the ramblings of a mad man, but according to Kep, many Lurr had the same reaction."
0,Inym left and ran to the rubble of the first collapsed hut.
0,"After asking for any Lurr involved, Inym met a Lurr mother with a non-Lurr elf child, showing that the mother’s evolution had progressed enough that she did not simply bear larva, likely being supplied blood regularly by her willing mate."
0,"Her answer was the same; the woman with Zose was death, and she felt she had to kill the woman before that death claimed her child."
0,The third Lurr Inym asked gave the same answer.
0,The fourth was no different.
0,"They all spoke as if the woman under Zose’s protection would bring death or was death itself, indescribably dangerous."
0,Perhaps there was more to that wanted poster than anyone realized.
0,"If that woman was Ceil, the widow of the late emperor, would her life truly be worth enough riches to make one a king?"
0,No sane person would solicit such a reward.
0,What if the bounty was so high because of the danger that individual possessed?
0,The most dangerous of bounties always came with higher reward or there would be little incentive to take on such dangers.
0,And now that danger has entered the wilderlands.
1,Inym ran back to Pyn’s tavern and slid a table in front of the entry to show to others the tavern was closed.
0,Pyn exited the back room hearing the noise.
0,Inym grabbed his arm and pulled him to the back.
0,“We must talk.”
0,“First you should eat.”
0,“No.” Inym spun Pyn and pushed him back against the wall.
0,She could not continue this discussion as old friends.
0,This was a hunter mercenary matter of greatest importance.
0,"Pyn immediately understood, and his face grew rigid."
0,“How much can you vouch for Zose’s honor?”
0,"“When it comes to his work, he is among the most reliable,” Pyn answered."
0,“Did he mention where he was taking that woman?
0,Was it to the Afarit?”
0,"“He mentioned he was guarding her on her way there, yes.”"
0,Inym removed her hand from Pyn’s chest.
0,"“I am sure you have heard of the bounty on the widow of Emperor Yuro, an elf girl appearing about three years in age.”"
0,“Are you saying that is the girl he is protecting?”
0,“At first I thought he was going to collect the bounty.
0,"He sent an urgent message from Ib’nua to Amel hinting he would make the exchange at the Afarit, or at least that was how it seemed."
0,"That is what I am investigating, but why would he travel so far?"
0,Amel is just as far but an incomparably easier journey than the Afarit.”
0,“You are wondering if Zose would be the type to deceive an employer for a bounty.
0,"I cannot say for certain, but I do not think he would."
0,"If anything, Basara would roast him if he tried."
0,Her honor is unmistakable.”
0,Inym took a deep breath.
0,“What if there was a greater purpose that would lead him to do so nonetheless?”
0,"She explained what she learned from the Lurr of the village, and as she did so, Pyn grew more and more troubled."
0,"“The Amelian Empire has fallen, and Tolmyur controls Amel."
0,"The war should be over, and yet Tolmyur has mustered all its armies to kill the widow."
0,Why?
0,Why target a single woman?
0,Why have they not succeeded despite their efforts?”
0,"“Perhaps they cannot kill her,” Pyn realized."
0,“Because she is death.
0,"Death would never claim one of its own, but it may be even worse than that."
0,"The Lurr claim she kills the ven around her, that death spreads from her."
0,She is a living plague.
0,"Emperor Yuro discovered the girl and must have taken her to wife to claim that power for himself, the wretched man he was."
0,"Tolmyur’s invasion released that calamity into the world, and now they are trying in desperation to contain it."
0,"Their feud is with the elves, so why would they choose to wage war against the fairies to pursue her?”"
0,"Before Pyn could answer, Inym continued."
0,"“If the other races learn they have released a calamity upon them, it would worsen their already hostile relations with the bordering nations that were never members of the Amelian Empire, sealing Tolmyur’s destruction."
0,That must be the reason for such an enormous bounty.
0,"No doubt it is half the coffers of the Amelian palace, half the spoils of their victory long sought since ages past."
0,"They are giving all that up to hunt one girl.”
“Zose is headed for the Afarit…” Pyn stood in pensive thought."
0,“His message stated that he has her at the Afarit.
0,"Now that I know what kind of monster that woman is, I doubt he is turning in the bounty."
0,"The length of message a spik can carry is small, so you cannot give lengthy explanations."
0,Zose is not presenting her to the Afarit for her protection to dissuade the Tolmyur kingdom from their pursuit.
0,He was informing Tolmyur that he knows a way to kill her.”
0,Pyn reached the same conclusion as Inym.
0,“Bydrofe.
0,"If she is a living calamity, perhaps the titan knows a way.”"
0,“I have made a terrible mistake.
0,"My initial goal was to secret away the widow to claim the bounty instead, and I have accomplices in waiting ahead down the highway to the Afarit."
0,I sent out an order to rally the Lurr of Sen’uon against Zose’s party.”
0,If her ill-formed attempts to capture the widow led to the widow fleeing or becoming lost--a direct repeat of Tolmyur’s mistake in Amel--it could spell disaster for the wilderlands.
0,She should not be hindering Zose but helping him in his quest to kill her.
0,"Pyn grew angry, but he did not chastise Inym’s actions."
0,“I will send someone after Zose’s party to explain the situation.”
0,"Inym waited anxiously at Pyn’s tavern for two days to hear back from Pyn’s messenger only to learn that Zose’s party left the road at the valley to travel cross-country, and the heavy snowfall had covered their tracks."
0,Chapter 9
0,“The Worst News Possible”
1,"Three blizzards, one after the other."
0,"If Byurk was not under direct orders from a higher general, he never would have marched into the wilderlands in the height of winter."
0,"He wanted to be done with the war in Vallen, but now he had to lead his frost-bitten men through frigid mountains they were ill-equipped to endure."
0,"Like Ib’nua, the second village they passed gave them no welcome, would not house his freezing soldiers, and refused to sell supplies."
0,"In a day or so pending fair weather, they would happen upon another village from an explanation of the road that he was able to force out of a trio of travelers headed back the other way."
0,"It was a Lurr village, and although he knew they were not uncommon in the wilderlands, the thought of relying on one made Byurk’s skin crawl."
0,“Keep march.
0,"If you stop, I will abandon you at the Lurr village."
0,You can live your life with them in this frozen wasteland.”
0,Several of his men whose feet had grown sluggish picked up pace.
0,"The giants were more than tall and strong enough to plow through the deep snow, and the humans who marched behind them struggled little."
0,"Byurk led the group, often through drifts reaching his neck."
0,"If not for his water magic parting the snow in front of him, he would not be able to walk."
0,"As their leader, he certainly would not make his giants march in front of him."
0,"Every five-hundred-yard stretch felt like a shuffle of the last five-hundred yards: the same white-capped peaks towering in the distance, the same rocky crags and steep ravines, and the same sturdy pines immune to the cold and elevation growing wherever their roots could grab hold."
0,At least his large numbers deterred any would-be predators from ambushing them from the innumerable crevices and ridges.
0,"When pursuing the widow of the emperor through Melia, he felt his mission had purpose."
0,"When assaulting Revlan in the plains of western Vallen, he knew the exhausting campaign would soon end."
0,"Every second the frozen air numbed his fingers and the snow chilled his feet, Byurk questioned why pursuit of the widow was so important."
0,"He knew Jethro’s reasons, and they made sense, but the Amelian Empire would never be reborn."
0,"The fairies had rallied behind her, but they were eliminated."
0,The hamadryad had taken her side but was eliminated by an even greater power among the dryads of Dhuillir.
0,No other nation would dare support the widow in striking back against Tolmyur.
0,"Jethro should secure his hold in Amel, work to create networks for communication and travel between Amel and Tolmyur, and let the widow hide away in isolation."
0,Surely she had seen enough of the destruction that followed her to rid any lingering thought of rebellion or retaliation.
0,Byurk would abandon the pursuit if not for a fear lingering in his mind.
0,"The widow was willing to surrender to Tolmyur during the standoff in Revlan’s central district, but she was rescued by her Habha at the cost of her otherworld companion’s life."
0,"If the message given to the pixie in Ib’nua could be trusted, she was headed north, but to what end?"
0,Why was he given that message if not to ensure he pursued?
0,"Did she give him the message for him to follow, or was it another who knew of her identity?"
0,Was it the party that fled Revlan?
0,"Byurk wanted to speak with the widow, not in hostility or as a commander of an army ready to wage war for her capture."
0,"He wanted to speak with her person to person, as two people who tired of seeing lives lost over one woman."
0,"Hopefully this time, the fourth time, he could convince her to surrender."
1,"As these thoughts occupied Byurk’s mind, he spotted his forward scout hunkered in the elbow of a rock at the bend ahead."
0,He doubted his scout would succumb to a frozen death.
0,"As he neared, he could just see faint puffs of breath."
0,"If the scout did not return immediately, there was little chance it was an emergency."
0,He was observing and waiting for Byurk to catch up to report.
0,"Before Byurk could reach the bend, the scout signaled: target party ahead, visible."
0,"The widow was their true target, but what caused the excursion into the wilderlands was the party that fled Revlan during the battle."
0,"The Revlan party was ahead, perhaps with the widow, and should he approach the bend, his army would be visible to them."
0,The three blizzards had slowed them down.
0,"Without being able to take shelter in the villages he passed, Byurk had forced his men to march through the blizzards to find an area of sufficient cover."
0,Those frigid marches caught them up to that party.
0,"The snow was deep, and the Revlan party would be unable to flee so easily."
0,"Should he confront them here, he could facilitate their immediate surrender, if they were willing."
0,"Byurk raised his hand and signaled preparation for battle, silent approach."
0,"Weapons unsheathed behind him, but little other noise was made."
0,Ranks reorganized.
0,Byurk signaled to the scout asking for distance.
0,The scout signaled back: three hundred yards.
0,They were close.
0,"Of course, in such winding mountain roads, visibility down the road was seldom far."
0,Thankfully the deep snow had muffled the approach of his fifty men.
0,Next he asked for terrain.
0,"The reply: shallow valley, light bend east, enemy on the rise."
0,The road lowered in elevation briefly as it bent around the ravine to the right and then rose again.
0,The other party was atop the rise on the other side.
0,"Enemy status: camp, preparations for departure."
0,"Perfect, he could catch them unawares, increasing his chance at persuading their surrender."
0,This was the perfect opportunity.
0,Byurk sent his rangers up the ridge to circle above the road as a precaution and led his remaining soldiers around the bend.
0,* * *
1,"“Pack up quickly,” Basara ordered."
0,"“If we can keep our pace, we will reach Hen’anin by tomorrow evening.”"
0,Their camp was little more than a few oiled tarps suspended over cleared ground.
0,"The three Melians managed the cold just fine without clothing, albeit a tad sluggish in their movements, and the two trolls took care of most of the heavy work and any fires that were needed."
0,"Surprisingly, the oread woman, Chloe, seemed able to ignore the cold just as easily as she could."
0,"Perhaps like Zose, she was accustomed to it."
0,"The remaining members of the party, the elves, fairy, spriggan, and human struggled with the many days of travel in the snowy mountains."
0,"They had left in pursuit of Ceil without any preparation, and Basara prepared what she could with the funds handed her by Zose before he left, but they still lacked."
0,"“Is there any way we could send someone more mobile ahead to intercept your husband’s party to inform them to wait for us,” Kiri asked."
0,"“You would need to hire a skilled tracker in Hen’anin, but we do not have the funds.”"
0,Basara looked ahead over the far ridge in the distance behind which Hen’anin was located.
0,"Past that ridge, the mountains opened into miles of plains before another steep range, worse than the Nuanae."
0,"Much of the geography of the western wilderlands resembled ripples of mountains that only grew steeper and more dangerous the closer one traveled to the center, beginning with the Nuanae range on the border, then the Nuafonen, Hemenonan, and at the center, the Afarit."
0,“And even a skilled tracker would have little hope of catching Zose past Hen’anin unless we hired a Lurr.
0,"He takes a different path over the plains, avoiding the common road."
0,"His trail is much faster but is seldom used because the mountain pass it connects too is treacherous, and lycon hunting parties often attack any lone travelers who leave the common road.”"
0,“There are beastkin in the wilderlands?”
0,Basara understood Kiri’s surprise.
0,"Beastkin and elfkind never coexisted, and any attempt to settle in lands owned by the other led to war and eventual extermination."
0,"The mostly lawless wilderlands were the only exception on this continent, and only in the northern wilderlands that were too inhospitable for most to live."
0,"“Lycon are more common in the tundra north of the wilderlands, but a few tribes migrate along the plains between the ranges."
0,Sending a lone tracker after Zose would be a death sentence.
0,"Besides, the snow would have covered his tracks anyway."
0,His goal is to reach the Afarit as quickly as possible.
0,"If there was any location we could catch him, it would be at Sen’uon, and only if he has trouble securing passage through the city."
0,That city is the only feasible way through this side of the Hemenonan range.”
0,Basara glanced past Kiri and sighed.
0,She approached Justin who was trying to tie the oiled fabric of his tent back into a tight bundle to be carried.
0,His cold-numbed fingers combined with the waterproofing oils on the fabric made his attempts futile.
0,"When in camp or during rest periods he only meditated, emitting an unfamiliar ven signature from rare affinity use."
0,He clearly had no survival experience and was incredibly weak compared to the others.
0,He could only carry as much as Kiri who was half his size.
0,She grabbed the leather straps from him and quickly bound up the tarp.
0,"“Sorry,” Justin said, dejected."
0,Basara smiled reassuringly at him.
0,Much of his apparent weakness was emotional.
0,"From what she learned, he had lost someone most dear to him in Revlan, another human who stood with them against Tolmyur in protection of Ceil."
0,"No matter how much Kiri tried to stop him from working, to let others take care of his burden, he refused their aid."
0,“Tolmyur soldiers!” Benab called from higher on the nearby ridge.
0,The camp immediately scrambled to their arms.
0,"Down the road behind them, about forty Tolmyur soldiers marched around the bend."
0,A lone minum led the party.
0,"From what Basara could see, there were no bowmen present in the group."
0,"“Benab, Lemi, Tae, eyes on the rocks,” Basara called."
0,“They sent their rangers ahead.”
0,"Lemi drew her bow, nearly as tall as she and grown from one of the great pines when they set out from Ib’nua."
0,“I see one!” She loosed her arrow at some enemy Basara could not see far up the ridgeline.
0,"“Hit him,” she announced."
0,"“Keep watching for rangers,” Basara ordered."
0,Thanysa stood as vanguard with Hethyro.
0,Kiri took flight out and away from the road for a better vantage.
0,"Basara drew her sword, ready to fight at the front with the trolls when the enemy platoon halted just before the dip in the road."
0,The minum alone walked forward.
0,“Is that…” Chloe spoke up from behind Basara.
0,"Basara did not understand the brief words in an unknown language, but Chloe clearly recognized the minum."
0,The air around Chloe heated so fast that Basara felt it even with her heat tolerance.
0,"Chloe’s usually mild demeanor vanished in an instant, replaced with rage."
0,"Basara recognized the signs immediately, having lost control of her own emotions many times in the past."
0,"When Chloe erupted in flames, Basara knew she had been terribly mistaken."
0,Chloe was not an oread.
0,She was a maenad like her.
0,“Byurk!” Chloe ran enflamed past the troll vanguard down the road.
0,* * *
1,Impossible.
0,Byurk had seen Chloe Hearn fall into that bottomless black fissure.
0,There was no way that otherworlder could have survived.
0,First that time mage survived buried in water under a ton of earth and stone.
0,Now it happened again.
0,Were these otherworlders immortal?
0,“Retreat!” Byurk ordered but too late.
0,"A massive fireball soared over him, colliding with the soldiers in the back ranks."
0,The force of the blast sent Byurk tumbling forward over the snow down the road.
0,His head ached and his ears rang.
0,"When he righted himself, he saw a black plume billowing into the sky."
0,His entire platoon was either engulfed in flame or motionless on and off the road.
0,Their path of escape was gone.
0,"Had he stood with them instead of approaching to solicit discourse, he would have died."
0,Another fireball approached.
0,Byurk propelled himself over the snow to the bottom of the shallow valley of the road.
0,That last fireball finished off what few of his men might have survived the first.
0,Byurk looked up the road at the harbinger of death engulfed in flames glaring down at him.
0,One last flame grew in her hands.
0,"“Chloe, stop!"
0,That is enough!” A nymph ran after the otherworlder and grabbed her flaming arms.
0,“Cease this!
0,I must speak with their commander!”
0,"In the brief struggle, the flame the otherworlder conjured erupted in her hands between her and the nymph, bathing them and the entire road in fire."
0,Their party up the road called out for the safety of their members.
0,The flame swirled and gathered in the center of the road.
0,"The nymph spun her arms, and the flame followed her motions, perfectly under her control."
0,"She swept her arms to the side, and the fire arched as a large ribbon over and down the slope of the mountainside, leaving none remaining on the road or covering the otherworlder who now knelt naked and afraid on the hot ground."
0,Byurk had seen this level of flame control mastery before.
0,"The woman who led this party through the wilderlands was none other than Jethro’s former companion, Basara."
0,"“Basara, I surrender to you,” Byurk called, prostrating himself in the snow."
0,* * *
1,“I’m sorry.
0,"I’m sorry,” Chloe repeated again and again in an apologetic fit."
0,Basara coddled the young woman.
0,"Losing to one’s anger was a terrifying experience, especially when the destructive power of fire was included."
0,"Had Basara not been half maenad, she would not have survived that explosion, dooming their party in the wilderlands."
0,Even a skilled fire mage would have been severely injured if not killed by the heat of Chloe’s flame.
0,Chloe’s heat surpassed her own and lacked any control.
0,"“Chloe, are you alright?” Justin ran down the road beside Benab, nearly slipping on the melting snow, but they could not cross the red-hot road to Chloe."
0,"Hethyro hurried past him, cloak in hand, and draped it over Chloe’s naked shoulders."
0,He alone was the only other fire mage in their party and could handle Chloe’s radiating heat.
0,"After only a few seconds of resting on Chloe’s back, the cloak caught flame."
0,"“Grab one of my gowns,” Basara ordered."
0,She waited until Hethyro returned and then dressed Chloe.
0,"Unlike the cloak and Chloe’s former clothing, the fabric woven from Basara’s hair perfectly resisted Chloe’s heat."
0,“Cool her down with the snow while I speak with the enemy commander.”
1,Basara walked down the road to the minum who remained with his head bowed into the melting snow.
0,"“It has been quite some time since we last saw each other,” Basara said standing over the minum."
0,“You can rise.
0,I will not harm you.”
0,Byurk lifted his head to look into Basara’s smiling face.
0,She knelt down to speak level with Byurk.
0,"“I am glad you are well, old friend.”"
0,"“Thank you for sparing me,” Byurk replied."
0,“At least for now.
0,I do not doubt those behind you will demand my execution.
0,I plead that you convince them to take me prisoner.
0,I will cooperate in any way needed.”
0,“Gather your archers on the ridge and whoever might have survived.
0,I would prefer we speak officially with all members present.
0,"I will try to convince the Melians with me to aid your men,” Basara said."
0,“I must inform you that my scout will have retreated to report what just transpired.”
0,"“Even if he survives traveling on his own through the wilderlands back to your main forces, it will make little difference."
0,I will wait for you at our camp.
0,I trust you will not flee.
0,"There is much I wish to know, and I am sure you are the same.”"
0,"Byurk bowed again, silently praising his good fortune in meeting a former ally and hero of Tolmyur, someone who would not outright want him dead."
1,"While Byurk gathered the survivors among his men, Basara returned to Chloe and Justin to ask them all they knew about Byurk and his involvement in the war from their perspective."
0,She did not fear Byurk would flee with his remaining men.
0,"Having been hunter mercenaries together for a brief time before serving together through the Coastal War, she had a deep trust in him, and no doubt he had the same unshakable trust in her."
0,Questioning Chloe and Justin took time due to their poor language abilities.
0,At least Chloe showed some aptitude in Elven due to her constant practice with Benab who seemed quite attached to the woman.
0,"Justin’s ability was to a lesser degree, possibly because he did not talk much to anyone."
0,"Basara learned of Byurk’s pursuit of Ceil in Melia, that he led the campaign in Vallen, and that because of him and his armies, Chloe’s friend and Justin’s lover, Sammy, had died."
0,Basara now understood Chloe’s rage-filled assault against Byurk and his soldiers.
0,"Byurk pleaded for Basara to spare him, but she was unsure that would be possible given the circumstances and the level of Byurk’s involvement."
0,"Byurk was promoted to lieutenant at the end of the Coastal War, but as the leader of the Vallen campaign, he was likely a general now, and generals were never spared if captured as a matter of course."
0,Their hands bore the blood of all whom their soldiers killed in the many battles over which they presided.
0,"Basara’s personal feelings may not be enough to spare his life, and she also needed to take caution for her own safety."
0,"Over the days of travel, she never once mentioned her connections to Tolmyur, Jethro, and now Byurk, all sources of this group’s suffering, and those connections would likely become known in their discussion with Byurk."
0,"Shortly after Basara’s questioning of Chloe and Justin finished, Byurk marched slowly up the road with eight human rangers behind him."
0,Not one of his men in formation had survived Chloe’s ruthless assault.
0,At least this meant she would not have to convince Tyree to treat the injured.
0,"Thanysa and Hethyro stood guard before the camp with one of the elves, but Byurk did not approach."
0,"Instead, he bowed his head to the ground."
0,Basara walked out to meet him and then escorted him to the camp where Benab bound Byurk’s wrists to his ankles behind his back.
0,"Byurk was forced to kneel before Kiri, Justin, and Basara while two elves pointed spears at his back."
0,"Chloe sat off to the side between the exchange, the gown she borrowed from Basara billowing in her radiating heat that melted the snow around her."
0,"Chloe’s wrath was palpable, but she did not lash out and remained as composed as Justin."
0,Perhaps the woman had more control over her maenad impulses than Basara thought.
0,"When Basara was Chloe’s age, Jethro often had to lock her in a barrier the moment something set her off until she calmed down."
0,Kiri led the interrogation as sponsor and leader of the party.
0,"“General Byurk, Basara tells me that you are fully willing to cooperate in any way we demand."
0,Is that true?” She emphasized the word “any” to make certain he understood that his life depended on his full cooperation.
0,"“I cannot reveal critical information that could potentially endanger the Tolmyur Kingdom, even under pain of death, but as for my involvement here in the wilderlands and the campaign in Vallen, I am willing to speak.”"
0,Kiri stared down Byurk.
0,"Secrets of the Tolmyur Kingdom would benefit her little now that the fairies lost in Vallen, so Basara hoped Byurk’s reservations were acceptable."
0,"She did not want to see her friend executed, and being a maenad, witnessing such an act might set her off and endanger the party."
0,Perhaps informing Kiri of their connection was the safest route.
0,"“Before we continue,” Basara cut in, “I must inform you that Byurk and I are former companions and fought together for Tolmyur in the Coastal War back in my mercenary days."
0,"For your safety and the safety of your party, I must warn you that, as a maenad, I do not believe my emotions could bear watching his torture or execution."
0,"He has promised me his cooperation as a friend, so I implore that you trust that promise.”"
0,"Kiri glared at Basara, now realizing that her party had been at the mercy of a guide with direct connections to the generals of Tolmyur."
0,"“Do not fault her,” Byurk pleaded."
0,“Basara abandoned Tolmyur two years ago and has made no attempt at communication since.”
0,“I will leave the matter of whether or not I can believe your claim and trust that our guide is true for later.
0,"General Byurk, what is your exact mission here in the wilderlands.”"
0,"“To pursue the party that fled Revlan, your party, and if possible, find the widow of Emperor Yuro."
0,My mission was given as punishment for my failings in Revlan in letting her escape from me once again.”
0,"Justin tensed beside Basara, the knuckles of his fists growing white atop his lap."
0,He understood more of the conversation in Elven than Basara previously assumed.
0,Perhaps his conversation skills only lacked.
0,Basara understood Byurk’s mission.
0,“The one who gave you this mission was a higher ranked general.
0,He disapproves of Byurk’s failure and so he gave him a mission he could not possibly complete.
0,His goal is not so much the capture of Ceil but Byurk’s possible death in the wilderlands.
0,Byurk’s soldiers are ill-equipped for such a task.
0,"Suicide missions are not uncommon for commanders in Tolmyur to regain honor lost in battle,” she explained to Kiri."
0,"“Kiri, daughter of Thorn General Dharin, Royal Chief Advisor of Vallen, it was by my order against the demands of General Bregon to cease the battle across the ravine for a final attempt at negotiation to spare what remained of your people in Revlan."
0,"Like my futile attempts to move the conflict away from Dhuillir to prevent the involvement of the dryads, the genocide of your people was never my aim, but I was duty-bound to continue the campaign."
0,"Thrice I tried convincing Ceil to surrender herself to end the slaughter, not just for my own desire to end the war but for the sake of those who should never have been part of it."
0,"The ancestral feud is between Tolmyur and the elves, not all races under the empire’s banner.”"
0,"“And yet your commanding general has chosen to involve us nonetheless,” Kiri replied, refuting Byurk’s meager plea of goodwill."
0,“I cannot speak of Jethro’s reasoning in all of this.”
0,Basara’s heart sank.
0,"She felt she could speak for Jethro, because she knew what happened."
0,“It is as I feared.
0,Jethro has gone mad.”
0,Byurk glared at Basara.
0,"“You can only see his actions from the outside, but know that while you fled from the tribulations of the people of Tolmyur, Jethro has worked tirelessly for their benefit.”"
0,"A fire lit within Basara, and she fought to contain it before it erupted out of her control."
0,Kiri and Justin felt Basara’s radiant heat and readied to distance themselves if needed.
0,"“My allegiance was never to Tolmyur,” Basara retorted, half shouting."
0,"“When I left, it was not Tolmyur I abandoned but Jethro to his madness."
0,"If I had known what he would become and that he would not hesitate to plunge this world into chaos in pursuit of the life of a single terrified girl, I would have killed him there in Tolmyur’s archives and burned the history of your nation’s ire against the elves down with him.”"
0,"“Basara,” Kiri reprimanded."
0,Basara took several deep and troubled breaths.
0,"Eventually her temperature regulated, and the flame cooled to embers."
0,"She was dangerously close, and there was none here save maybe Chloe who could have protected everyone from her emotional rampage."
0,"“You see it too, Byurk."
0,"In your desire not to involve the dryads or unjustly punish the fairies, you know Jethro is lost.”"
0,"“What is Jethro’s aim in seeking the life of Empress Ceil,” Kiri asked to redirect the topic back to gaining information from their prisoner."
0,"She had a lot of questions about Basara’s involvement with Jethro, but that would need to wait for another time and place."
0,"“He seeks the extermination of the royal line, to eliminate the family of the one to whom his anger is most directed, Eydis FeAmel, and by doing so, prepare the way for Tolmyur’s eventual recovery from the crimes of the elves in generations past."
0,"The Tolmyur Kingdom, the nation of the minums, predates the Amelian Empire by thousands of years."
0,The creation of your empire led to the destitution of my nation through no fault of our own.
0,"So long as your empire stood and their prejudices remained, so long as your empire had the slightest chance of being reborn, Tolmyur would continue to suffer."
0,"Tell me, Royal Chief Advisor Kiri, in your desire to fight to the very last fairy in protection of one whom you call Empress Ceil, was it out of a desire to protect a terrified girl pursued by an entire nation or was it with the hope of reviving your empire with little care to the girl’s own wishes on the matter.”"
0,"Kiri raised her hand, and the two elves pressed Byurk’s face into the frigid mud with the hafts of the spears crossed over his neck."
0,"Basara feared Byurk’s execution would soon follow and almost intervened, but Kiri’s hand lowered."
0,"The spears eased off Byurk’s neck, and he was allowed to kneel once more."
0,"Kiri smiled, almost laughing."
0,“You are ignorant of the truth of what is happening.
0,The extermination of the fairies is but a trifle thing compared to the life of Empress Ceil.
0,I do not protect her because of duty to a fallen empire or familial obligation.
0,I protect her because the very beings who observe and oversee not only this world but countless worlds in the infinite cosmos have demanded it of me.
0,"Should Empress Ceil die, Whinhlem may be doomed.”"
0,Byurk’s eyes widened and shot between Justin and Chloe.
0,“Then these otherworlders…”
0,“Perhaps you are not as ill-informed.
0,"Yes, these two not of our world are like Empress Ceil, protected by the sprites, and you in your ignorance you have killed one of them, which very well could spell disaster for us all.”"
0,“The controller of the habha…” Byurk’s eyes stared into nowhere in front of him as he made connections in his own mind.
0,"His lips parted, and in nothing but a whisper, he spoke, “Then Jethro is…” in his native tongue."
0,Byurk’s words bridged the same connection in Basara’s mind.
0,"“Kiri, if what you claim is true, there is something you should know."
0,"Jethro is not of our world, not of Whinhlem."
0,He comes from a world he calls Trattnou.”
0,"Kiri’s haughty attitude vanished in an instant, replaced by the shock of what might be the worst possible revelation."
0,"The conversation in Elven was terribly difficult for Chloe to follow, but she felt eternally grateful to Benab for personally tutoring her over their days of travel in the wilderlands out of his desire to communicate with her."
0,She understood enough.
0,The revelation about Jethro brought a terrifying curiosity to her mind that for a moment replaced her rage against Byurk.
0,"“Ephora or Arkhon, are you listening,” Chloe called up into the sky, confusing the others who could not understand her words."
0,"After a moment of silence, she called again."
1,The silhouette of a small figure appeared in the center of the group.
0,"Because Justin shied away or perhaps did not want to look at or acknowledge her, Chloe knew this was Ephora."
0,The others grew astonished at the sudden appearance of a sprite.
0,“You have a question?” Ephora asked.
0,"“Although I have a feeling that I know what it is, and you will not like the answer.”"
0,"“Is Jethro like Ceil, Justin, and me?"
0,Is he important to whatever disaster that’s going to come?”
0,Ephora smiled.
0,"The advent of the calamity was nearly upon them, but she could not reveal this without endangering the sprites’ foresight."
0,"Revealing the time would create such a distortion that it may take a hundred years for the Sprite’s foresight to become accurate once more, instead of a manner of minutes, hours, or days as their former involvement had done."
0,"She reasoned that she could, however, answer Chloe’s question, because that information had already been revealed to some."
0,"At the worst, it would only cause a few days of blindness, a risk she felt justified to prevent them from taking any undesired or dangerous actions."
0,She turned to all who stared and spoke into their minds in their own native languages.
0,"“Like Ceil, Jethro is important not only to the survival of your world but that of other worlds."
0,"If Jethro dies, billions of lives may be lost.”"
0,"Without another word, Ephora vanished."
0,"Her final statement was the worst news for Justin, Chloe, and all those in opposition to Jethro."
0,"For Basara and Byurk who both knew of Jethro’s tenacity and madness, the problem was even greater."
0,They had to convince Jethro to spare Ceil.
0,"If not, they had to somehow stop him without killing him."
0,"For all Jethro’s apparent reason or lack thereof, neither of them knew if he would stop his attempts to kill Ceil knowing that countless lives could be lost should he succeed."
0,"After all, he willingly ordered the genocide of the fairies--millions of lives--for his goals."
0,Chapter 10
0,“The Path of Least Resistance”
0,Ceil
1,The cold winds of the mountains were nothing compared to the gusts of the plains.
0,"The mountain winds chilled Ceil, but these constant violent winds nearly swept Ceil off her feet, and the chill cut her through her cloak to her core."
0,She felt naked in a storm despite her armor and many layers.
0,"Coby huddled close, guarded under her cloak because the winds were too much even for him."
0,"The first day across the plains he managed with his wind magic directing the wind around him, but by the second day he could not keep his ven levels high enough to continue."
0,The winds peeled his wings open and threatened to pull him away into the unknown.
0,"Her cloak could barely hold them both, but Ceil could not trust Zose or the others to care for Coby the same way."
0,"Zose had already chastised her for attempting to save him from the Lurr wolf, so she did not doubt that they would abandon him to the winds in an emergency."
0,"“Burster incoming,” Dyson shouted."
0,Ceil glanced upwind to the snowless sky and saw the clouds in the distance roll like an inverted wave approaching at incredible speed.
0,She immediately dropped to the ground with Coby under her and buried down as far as she could into the snow.
0,Zose dropped next to her and clung tight to her cloak.
0,No more than a few seconds later a deafening wind roared over her that peeled away the top layer of snow and nearly her along with it.
0,"Coby cried in protest at being smothered, but Ceil only held him tighter in fear."
0,"The burster only lasted a minute, much shorter than any previous."
0,"Zose rose and lifted Ceil and Coby from the snow, brushing off her cloak so that the ongoing wind wouldn’t freeze the snow to her."
0,"Coby rustled under her cloak in irritation, so Chloe stroked his feathers to calm him down."
0,The last thing she wanted was for him to peel her cloak open in frustration and be carried away.
0,"“Could we not have taken the road,” Ceil protested for the umpteenth time."
0,The road meandered through the various trenches and ravines across the plains to protect travelers from the winds.
0,"Zose claimed his route was much faster, but Ceil could not see how with how often the bursters appeared."
0,“How do you even know where we are going?”
0,"Zose pulled Ceil forward without a word, so she did not know if he heard her over the deafening wind."
0,"“A trick we learned from the lycon,” Zose eventually shouted back."
0,He stood and angled himself so the wind directly hit his side.
0,"“The winds always follow parallel to the plains, so if you walk perpendicular to them, you will eventually reach the Nuafonen range.”"
0,"“If you are accustomed enough,” Dyson continued from just behind Ceil, “you can angle yourself to the wind and count your paces to chart a specific course."
0,Zose has a pass he uses through the Nuafonen that he learned from the lycon.
0,He is taking us there.”
0,"“It will bring us closer to Sen’uon than the pass the main road travels through Nuafonen,” Zose finished."
0,"Ceil welcomed a fast route, but she did not know how much longer she could last."
0,Zose was not so much leading her as he was pulling her along.
0,"She was sore and tired, not just from the cold but from fighting the wind for the past three days."
0,"She wanted to stop and rest, to set camp, but that would be impossible unless they reached a ravine."
0,"As far as Ceil could see, the plains were a perfectly flat, white expanse until the horizon or at least until distant snow or frozen humidity in the wind cut off further visibility."
0,Only a few barren trees sparsely dotted the landscape giving it some character.
0,It almost made her miss the home of her childhood.
0,She could imagine that in the summer when the snow was gone and the winds were milder these plains were covered with golden grass not unlike the never-ending grain of Filinceil.
0,"“Burster,” Jeddin shouted this time."
0,"Ceil half-moaned, half-whimpered as she dove again into the snow."
0,"This burster lasted far longer than the former, burying Coby and her under a drift of snow."
1,Ceil collapsed in the shelter of the crevice of a rock as Dyson lit a fire for camp.
0,Coby hopped around full of energy to rid himself of the irritation he felt being smothered over and over again for the third day in a row.
0,Ceil hated that he had so much energy.
0,She more or less had carried him under her cloak all day without food.
0,"They could only spare time to eat when they set up camp, and they only set up camp in the evening before they slept for the night."
0,A light meal in the evening and a heavy meal in the morning were all Ceil had to build her energy for an entire day of fighting unrelenting winds and deathly cold.
0,"“Cheer up, Gein,” Dyson said as he moved some heated stones next to Ceil."
0,She immediately grabbed them and held them to her core.
0,"“Once we pass the Hemenonan, the temperature will get much warmer."
0,You might even start missing the cold.”
0,"Preposterous, Ceil almost spat back at him."
0,"Dyson only laughed with his small-fanged grin, seemingly predicting what Ceil wanted to say."
0,"“If you want to warm up faster, I could always hold you."
0,Maybe take me up on the offer to show me your consort skills?”
0,Ceil scowled at him.
0,"She could not believe that diluting troll blood with humans could create something so debonair, but his unwanted advances were a never-ending source of irritation for her."
0,"Once their campfire roared, Ceil left the crevice and joined Jeddin and Dyson by the fireside."
0,Zose was out keeping first watch.
0,"He assured them that so long as he was there, they would have little issue with lycon, but there was still a risk."
0,"At least knowing that Lurr feared Ceil, there was even less risk of one lurking in the ravine attacking them."
0,"“How many more days,” Ceil asked to break the silence."
0,“Until we are off the plains or until we reach the Afarit?” Dyson asked.
0,"“Two on the plains,” Jeddin answered, “and then another three until Sen’uon."
0,"If we are lucky, we can find a spatial mage there to teleport us to the Afarit."
0,"Otherwise, it will be another ten days after that.”"
0,"“There is a major issue, though,” Dyson continued."
0,He pointed at Ceil.
0,“You.
0,"Sen’uon is the second largest city in the whole of the wilderlands, and it is run by Lurr."
0,It’s not like Hen’anin where Lurr simply live together with others.
0,Lurr rule that city.”
0,"“I wish we could avoid it, but that is simply not possible,” Jeddin said."
0,“Coby could fly me over the city.
0,"I could meet you on the other side,” Ceil suggested."
0,"“Zose will never agree to that,” Dyson rejected."
0,"“You are his charge, and he would never part from you."
0,"The Lurr flee at the sight of you, so we should be safe simply passing through."
0,Although we would have to abandon any hope of finding a spatial mage.”
0,"“No, I feel Gein’s plan is the best course of action,” Jeddin said as he added to the fire another strange coal from the satchel traded to them by Pyn, making it roar once again."
0,“It would be best to avoid Sen’uon altogether.
0,I will convince Zose.”
0,Ceil heard a high-pitched whistle from up the ravine.
0,Shortly afterwards Zose descended to the camp.
0,"“Lycon parties are out tonight,” he said while pocketing a small, thin brass whistle."
0,"“What was that whistle?” Ceil asked, slightly panicked."
0,“Would that not give us away?”
0,"“The opposite of what you think,” he replied."
0,“It tells them I am a friend and to not mind us.
0,They likely already noticed the glow of our fire here in the ravine long ago.
0,"We might get a visit, which is why I am informing you.”"
0,"Ceil was about to tell Zose her plan for Sen’uon, but Zose quickly returned up the ravine after relaying his message."
0,"“You are lucky to have Zose as a guide,” Dyson said once Zose was out of sight."
0,“Very few gain favor with lycon.”
0,"“The whistle is gifted by the lycon,” Jeddin elaborated."
0,“The pitch of each is distinct to the one gifted.
0,"A personal article is given in exchange, and the lycon distribute it so all the tribes remember the scent."
0,"When a whistle is blown, a lycon commonly appears if in the area to make certain the pitch matches their memory of the scent."
0,"If it does not, the tribes rally to kill the imposter and reclaim the whistle.”"
0,"“If one of us had blown Zose’s whistle and a lycon visited, we would be ambushed by no less than a hundred lycon before morning,” Dyson finished."
0,"“Kill one with a whistle, and the lycon treat it as killing one of their own.”"
0,"“How does one gain the lycons’ favor,” Ceil asked."
0,"“You must save the life of one of them without thought of reward,” Jeddin replied."
0,"“Beastkin are despised by most, and I am no different in my feelings towards their ilk.”"
0,"“Many have tried to play the lycons’ favor, creating or searching for situations where they could save a lycon’s life."
0,All have ended in failure and the death of the fool who tried.
0,"They appear as kin of beasts, but they are no less intelligent than you or I,” Dyson continued."
0,“How did Zose gain their favor then?”
0,"“I do not know,” Jeddin admitted."
0,“You had best ask him.”
0,"“It is because he saved a young lycon when completing one of his contracts,” Dyson answered."
0,Ceil’s eyes widened in astonishment.
0,She could imagine the situation was not all that different from how she met Zose.
0,"She felt it odd that he would go to such lengths to help her like this, but perhaps Zose was such a person."
0,“It happened like this.
0,"A small group of bandits had made a camp in a steep ravine, well-hidden and nigh impervious to assault.” Dyson leaned into the fire and cleaved the flame in two with his hand."
0,There it held in its new position as Dyson gathered smaller flames to sit along the cloven slopes.
0,"“Travelers, hunter mercenaries, and merchants alike fell prey to ambush."
0,They left none alive.” He removed a fresh coal from their provisions and moved it slowly between the flames.
0,All at once the smaller flames dove onto the coal setting it alight.
0,"Dyson dropped it into the other coals, and the fire resumed its natural shape."
0,"“If they left none alive, how did anyone learn of the bandits?"
0,"And don’t waste the coals,” Jeddin admonished."
0,"“That’s the key to the tale,” Dyson replied."
0,“People were disappearing somewhere between two villages.” Dyson raised his hand towards the top of their ravine in the direction of where Zose kept watch.
0,“Zose took the contract that no one else dared to claim to investigate the disappearances.
0,People feared that a powerful chimera was at fault.
0,"The terrain was rocky, so an oread was the best choice--the only choice."
0,"Had they sent a larger hunter party, the bandits would never show."
0,Any other small party would fall prey like all the others.
0,"“Zose travelled the pass like all the former victims, but when the ambush happened, he vanished."
0,None of the bandits knew how and why.
0,They searched for a time but eventually returned to their camp.
0,"Little did they know, Zose followed them within the rocks."
0,That was how Zose found the base.
0,That was how he found the victims.
0,"“The bandits were a terrible sort, cannibals with refined tastes."
0,"Not Lurr, if you could believe."
0,"Zose never expected to find the victims alive, but there was little remaining of them."
0,"There was only one sole survivor, a lycon child chained by her neck to a tree.” Zose wrapped the strap of his bag around his neck and pulled it taut."
0,"“Zose thought her dead at first, a possible meal for later, but lycon were not for their tastes it seemed."
0,"They made sport of her, tossing rocks and knives and whatever small objects fell into their grasp when the urge arrived.”"
0,"Dyson spoke with the melodic flair and gesticulation of a practice storyteller, enrapturing Ceil."
0,"His storytelling enveloped her, and she yearned to hear more, although she hid her desires under her tired expression."
0,“Zose quickly and quietly eliminated the bandits while they slept as an assassin who could swim unseen through stone.
0,He rescued the lycon child and nursed her back to health in secret at a nearby village.
0,"Not wanting to leave her to become prey to others, he brought her to the same storm-tossed plains we now travel and found a lycon pack to take her in."
0,"“The girl wanted to gift him a whistle then and there with the goodwill of the pack, a reward for his heroism, but Zose declined."
0,His claim: that he had no proof for them that his rescue was out of goodwill or if his sole desire was safer passage over the plains.” Dyson pressed his hand to his forehead in feigned astonishment.
0,He shook his head and continued the tale.
0,“He left them stunned and returned home.
0,A later contract sent Zose between the Nuanae and Nuafonen once more.
0,"A large pack built of four tribes hunted him down, trapping him on the road through the many ravines.”"
0,Dyson’s voice bled urgency as his rate of speech accelerated.
0,Ceil’s heart beat with anticipation.
0,"“He could simply escape by stepping into the stone as he did with the bandits,” Jeddin interrupted."
0,"“Let me guess, the pup was among them and presented him with the whistle, not giving him the option to refuse.”"
0,"“Don’t spoil the end,” Dyson rebuked, now back to his regular manner of speech."
0,He pushed Jeddin’s shoulder hard enough to topple Jeddin over.
0,Ceil felt deflated that the tale ended so abruptly.
0,"She could hardly remember the last time she had any entertainment, and she was loathed to admit that Dyson’s charisma only made her desire it more."
0,“Could you not see I was winning Gein over?” Dyson moaned.
0,"“Is the story true,” Ceil cut in, wishing she had not heard that last statement."
0,"“It is,” Dyson replied."
0,“Zose told me the tale when I went drinking with him and Basara not long after he returned with the whistle.
0,"It was just last summer, shortly after Emal was born."
0,You could always confirm it if some lycon do happen to visit us tonight.”
0,"As soon as Ceil was sufficiently warmed from the fire, sleep took her readily."
0,"If there was a visit that night, no one woke her, not even Coby."
0,The next morning Ceil could barely find the will to hike out of the ravine back onto the wind-tormented plains.
0,"Another day of trudging through snow drifts ranging from her calves to her hip in frigid, endless flatlands."
0,"By midday, she was more frustrated by the bursters than afraid of them."
0,"Her mantra of “only one more day” was all that kept her moving, that and Zose’s tight grip on her wrist pulling her onward."
0,She did not even want to think about the plains on the other side of the Nuafonen range.
0,Zose never told her if they were the same.
0,She could not bear the thought that they were similar or worse.
1,“Burster!”
0,Ceil dove into the shallow snow and covered Coby the best she could to wait out the violent winds.
0,Something snagged Ceil’s cloak by her neck and ripped her from the snow.
0,"She tumbled at incredible speed at the mercy of the burster unable to tell up from down, screaming with her eyes shut tight out of fear."
0,"A solid impact, and everything went dark."
0,* * *
1,A lycon shot like lightning towards their party in the burster.
0,"Zose noticed too late, and Ceil was ripped from his grasp."
0,"In the fraction of a second it took for Zose to lift his head, Ceil and her captor were nothing but a black dot in the distance and growing ever smaller."
0,"He pulled out his whistle and blew it as hard as he could, hoping that the lycon could hear it and know they were not enemies."
0,"Coby flapped up in confusion, the wind of his wings just barely cutting through the lingering burster."
0,He rose into the air and spotted the shrinking speck in the distance now mostly obscured by drifting snow caught in the high winds.
0,"With a great flap of his wings, he shot after Ceil."
0,Zose removed his cloak and grabbed the far corners in each hand.
0,"His cloak unfurled, and the burster caught it, ripping him from the snow and dragging him speedily away."
0,He prayed he could reach her before ill befell her.
0,She was the smallest of their party and inexperience on the plains.
0,The lycon must have thought that she would be easy prey.
0,At least the wind blew him the exact same direction it blew her.
0,The speck in the distance slowly grew.
0,"Zose could see Coby fluttering around in the air just above, attacking the lycon."
0,The lycon pinned Ceil to the snow with one arm while brandishing a crude sword at Coby with the other.
0,"Coby’s blades of wind could not hit without fear of striking Ceil, so he dove and attacked with his talons in a frantic, aggravated assault."
0,"The burster died, allowing Zose to right himself, and held both ends of his cloak in one hand to let it pull him instead of drag him."
0,"He blew the whistle, now close enough that the lycon would surely hear it, but the assault in the distance did not end."
0,Zose blew his whistle again but soon noticed something peculiar about this lycon.
0,The left ear atop the lycon’s head was missing.
0,"He snarled at Zose’s approach with his hairless, almost wolf-like face."
0,This lycon did not respect the whistles.
0,It was an aberrant or outcast of the tribes.
0,"Zose released his cloak, letting the wind carry it away, and drew his twin blades."
0,"Instead of preparing for a confrontation with Zose, the lycon grabbed Ceil under his sword arm and fled over the snow, half using his free hand as another leg to move faster."
0,"Even with the wind’s aid, Zose had no hope of catching him."
0,"Coby continued trying to grasp and claw at the lycon, but even he did little to impede the lycon’s flight."
0,"Once the next burster arrived, Zose did not doubt that he would lose Ceil."
0,He simply did not have the same bestial strength to allow him to control his movements in the burster’s might.
0,Zose sheathed his swords and blew through the other end of the whistle.
0,He heard no sound but knew that this distinct tone would pierce through the wind much further than the whistle’s normal tune.
0,"As he chased for another mile, he blew over and over again, glancing upwind behind him both to see if Jeddin and Dyson were following and out of fear of a possible burster."
1,A shadow approached from the south low along the snow.
0,It grew into several distinct bipedal forms seemingly running on their hands and feet.
0,They heard.
0,A pack of lycon was approaching.
0,The pack ran ahead and intercepted the fleeing lycon.
0,"Coby flew into the air, not knowing if he should continue attacking or whether these arrivals were friend or foe."
0,Zose glanced back behind him one last time and saw the rolling clouds.
0,“Coby!
0,"Burster,” he called as loud as he could."
0,"Coby looked towards him, and the intelligent hawk saw the approaching sign in the clouds."
0,He dove down into the snow just in time for the burster to blow over them.
0,The lycon stayed rooted in place against the burster.
0,They had the rogue lycon and Ceil pinned to the ground.
0,Zose waited out the burster and then approached once it passed.
0,Behind him he saw Jeddin and Dyson a ways off far in the distance.
0,They had ridden the second burster to catch up.
0,An elder lycon from the hunting party approached Zose.
0,"Behind him, another lycon carried Ceil in his arms."
0,"She looked heavily battered with numerous cuts on her face from the icy snow, but she was alive."
0,"“Is this companion of you,” the elderly lycon asked."
0,“It is.
0,Thank you for coming to my aid.” Zose handed his whistle to the elder.
0,The elder accepted it and reached for Zose.
0,"Zose stepped forward, and the elder embraced him, sniffing Zose’s neck and confirming ownership of the whistle."
0,"When they parted, the elder returned Zose’s whistle."
0,"“No, the debt has been repaid."
0,I cannot accept it.
0,"I called for your aid, and you answered."
0,"By custom, the whistle should be returned to you.”"
0,"“No, this one is our sin,” the elder replied with a growl."
0,"“We hunt him for nine days, and he escape us."
0,Your bird help us catch him.”
0,The lycon carrying Ceil set her down beside Zose.
0,"Coby immediately landed and lifted her to sit with his beak, wrapping her within the warmth of his wings."
0,The lycon watched the strange hawk in admiration.
0,"The lycons’ attention focused behind Zose, and they drew their weapons."
0,"“Wait, those two are my allies,” Zose called quickly."
0,"Dyson quickly ran to Ceil, but Jeddin stayed at a distance, his disgust of the lycon showing on his face."
0,"Dyson’s fire magic quickly warmed Ceil, but she remained unconscious."
0,"“Friend of lycon, we will escort you to safe camp,” the elder announced."
0,* * *
1,Ceil awoke to the crackling of a warm fire.
0,"Her body ached terribly, and her face and hands stung."
0,"She could hear a heated discussion around her, but Coby’s cry broke it up."
0,She blinked to clear her vision and saw Zose and Jeddin looking down at her.
0,Dyson sat frustrated on the other side of the fire.
0,"“How are you feeling,” Zose asked."
0,"“What happened?” Ceil tried to sit up, but she could barely move without pain wracking her entire body."
0,She stifled the cry that almost escaped and lay back down.
0,Her inability to move troubled her three escorts.
0,"“You were abducted by one of those beasts,” Jeddin replied."
0,Zose scowled at him.
0,"He then explained what happened, including that the lycon had saved her."
0,"“I apologize, but without your leave I investigated your injuries thoroughly."
0,Be assured that neither Dyson nor Jeddin saw.
0,"You are battered, but nothing seems broken that I could tell,” he finished."
0,"Ceil looked up from the camp to the dark sky above the steep ravine, far steeper than their last camp and partially covered by overhanging rock."
0,"A harsh snow was falling, but the high winds kept most of it out of the ravine."
0,“How long was I out?”
0,"“The sun only just set,” Jeddin answered."
0,"“We are about ten miles off course, but that is not much of a problem."
0,"If that was all, it would only be a minor delay.”"
0,"Ceil wanted to ask what also was the problem, but she felt she knew."
0,"“Do you think you can stand,” Zose asked."
0,"Ceil tried once more to sit up, but moving her core sent a surge of pain throughout her body."
0,She whimpered despite herself and lay back down.
0,"“You are in no shape to travel,” Zose announced."
0,"“We can rest here for another two days to give you time to recover, but after that we will need to move if we want our supplies to last until Sen’uon."
0,"I know your life magic is weak, but do what you can in that time.”"
0,"“I can carry you on my back to Sen’uon,” Dyson offered."
0,“I am the strongest among us.
0,We can seek treatment for you there.”
0,"“No, because of Gein’s injuries, we will avoid Sen’uon and seek treatment for her at the Afarit.”"
0,Dyson grew livid.
0,“You cannot seriously be considering following Jeddin’s plan.
0,"Gein needs help, and Sen’uon is only a few days away.”"
0,"“It is Gein’s plan,” Jeddin retorted."
0,"“Dyson, we cannot know how the Lurr will react to Gein in Sen’uon."
0,Finding help for her may be impossible.
0,The only life mages we could hire there will be Lurr.
0,Her injuries place her at even greater risk.
0,She was almost attacked in Hen’anin.
0,"If they see her injured, more might take the opportunity in their fright.”"
0,"“What says our party’s sponsor,” Jeddin asked, glancing down at Ceil."
0,Ceil wanted to retort that she was not sponsoring the party.
0,"Zose volunteered to help, and Jeddin and Dyson were only helping for their own reasons, but she was their charge, so perhaps it was common to leave such decisions to her to rid them of liability should the worst happen."
0,"They were professionals, after all."
0,"“We avoid Sen’uon,” Ceil decided."
0,"Danger was certainly a part, but for more personal reasons, she did not think she could emotionally endure passing through an entire city that was terrified of her very existence."
0,* * *
1,Inym huddled in against the wall of a ravine behind an outcrop of rock for a barrier against the wind and snow.
0,This was the first time since her injury she had attempted to cross the plains.
0,"She could manage the cold with her fire magic for a time, but on her liquid diet, her body could not store enough nutrients to sustain her fire magic for long, even something as simple as regulating her body heat."
0,She may as well not have a fire affinity at all.
0,She cursed her ill fortune catching a blizzard shortly after setting out from Hen’anin.
0,"In her healthy years, she could have run the long, winding road and arrived at the pass through the Nuafonen in eight days, blizzard or no."
0,"Now for the sake of warmth, she had spent two days traveling the distance she should have in one."
0,Inym questioned returning to Hen’anin.
0,She could never hope to catch Zose now.
0,"Kep hadn’t returned to report, so either that pixie was still monitoring Zose, lost him across the plains, or was having trouble finding her."
0,"Even if Kep came to report, Inym knew that it would be too late to calm the Lurr she had Deinan rile up in preparation for Zose’s arrival at Sen’uon."
0,Perhaps a city of Lurr could successfully kill that living calamity without the need for Bydrofe’s aid.
0,She could only hope.
0,A march from back down the road echoed through the ravine.
1,Inym peeked out from her cover to see a procession of various races led by a nymph.
0,"The regal Vallen armor of the elves towering over the rest suggested that perhaps they were headed for the Afarit to pay respects to Bydrofe as so many royals usually did, but the longer she watched, the stranger the party appeared."
0,A fair human and fairy marched behind the nymph accompanied by two dryads.
0,Behind them the three elves followed.
0,"A minum and line of humans, Tolmyur soldiers, came next with two trolls and an oread taking up the rear."
0,Why would Tolmyur march with Vallen north through the wilderlands?
0,“Do not move!”
0,Inym looked above her to see a sickly looking anthousai with bow drawn.
0,She never heard the young dryad approach.
0,"“I am not an enemy,” Inym replied with haste, her hands up and palms facing away."
0,A spriggan Inym had not seen with the procession arrived quickly to pull Inym onto the road.
0,She was forced to kneel before the nymph guide.
0,Inym recognized the guide.
0,"“Basara, I am not an enemy,” Inym pleaded."
0,"“What is your name,” Basara asked."
0,“I am Inym.
0,I work for Jit.”
0,Basara ordered the anthousai to lower her bow.
0,“What is your business alone on the road?
0,Are you in need of assistance?”
0,“No.
0,"I am in pursuit of your husband, Zose, and his party.”"
0,The air around Basara heated immediately.
0,"“Why,” she demanded."
0,"“I mean him no harm,” Inym replied quickly, although that was only true now."
0,"She could not tell her folly to Basara, a maenad, without fear of swift retribution."
0,“I learned of a ploy to use the Lurr against him and his party in Sen’uon to kill the one he escorts.
0,"I was on my way to warn him, but in my health, I cannot reach him in time."
0,"I had Pyn send a tracker after Zose from Hen’anin, but Zose left the road and could not be followed."
0,"If you visited Pyn on your way through Hen’anin, you might have heard similar news of your husband.”"
0,Basara calmed and lifted Inym to her feet.
0,"“Byurk, Kiri,” she called."
0,The minum and fairy ran to the front.
0,"The minum was clearly a commander of high standing given the markings on his armor visible just between the break in the front of his cloak, and the fairy had a regal air about her."
0,"The elves brandished their spears against the minum as he passed, guarding the fair human."
0,"The two parties were traveling together, but they were not allies."
0,Basara explained the situation to the troubled expression of the fairy.
0,"“How sure is the road ahead,” Byurk asked."
0,“Thanysa and I can travel faster than the rest.”
0,"Kiri called one of the trolls from the back of the procession, and Basara once again explained Inym’s warning."
0,The troll grew even more troubled than had the minum.
0,“Am I and the minum general to run ahead to protect her?” she asked.
0,"“Yes,” Kiri responded."
0,"“The road weaves, but there are no forks,” Basara explained."
0,"“You will not go astray, but be warry of the shallower ravines."
0,Keep an eye to the clouds upwind.
0,"When they roll, drop to the ground immediately or you will be carried away."
0,"At the Nuafonen pass, keep left on the road."
0,"The plains beyond are no different, but there are markers, obelisks, leading to Sen’uon."
0,I pray you make it in time.”
0,The troll and minum quickly gathered a bag of provisions and then sped down the road with their feet propelled by the earth beneath them.
0,Inym’s hands trembled.
0,"Both Vallen and Tolmyur were working together to protect the emperor’s widow who, according to her knowledge, was the reason for the war in Vallen."
0,Why?
0,Was Tolmyur’s goal not to kill her?
0,"Was that not why Zose was taking her to the titan, Bydrofe?"
0,She was clearly the embodiment of disaster as the Lurrs’ unanimous testimonies made known.
0,Inym’s frantic thoughts froze as the testimonies of the various Lurr repeated in her mind.
0,"She had thought they claimed she was death, but that was wrong."
0,Never once did they say the widow was death.
0,They claimed she carried it.
0,Death was about her.
0,Death was in her.
0,Death emanated from her.
0,"What if the widow only contained the evil within, and if she died that same evil would be released upon the world?"
0,"What if killing her was not the goal, but instead Zose wanted to discover with Bydrofe’s aid a means of eliminating or containing the evil she bore?"
0,Inym’s face grew pale.
0,"“Basara, tell me, please."
0,"If that woman dies, if the one Zose is escorting dies, what will happen?”"
0,"“Billions of lives could be lost,” Basara replied flatly."
0,Inym fell to her knees.
0,"She felt sick, nauseous, and had she a stomach, she would have vomited."
0,She mouthed her lament to the frigid ground beneath her.
0,I have doomed us all.
0,Chapter 11
0,“Life and Death”
0,Ceil
1,"After two days, Ceil could stand and walk but not without a lot of pain."
0,Her injuries from tumbling over the frozen plains at the mercy of the burster were far more severe internally than her paltry healing magic could address.
0,"She was hesitant about Dyson carrying her at first, but he was gentlemanly about his handling of her and personally covered her during every burster."
0,"Coby was fine without Ceil’s protection as he was the first day and a half, and that was how long it took them to finally clear the plains and reach the hidden pass through the Nuafonen range."
0,Ceil never thought she would be so happy to see mountains again.
0,Zose blew his whistle at the entrance to the pass once clear of the wind’s might.
0,"A figure jumped down from the rocks almost immediately, and Ceil got her first look at a lycon, a beastkin."
0,The lycon appeared half between a wolf and an elf.
0,"His nearly wolf-like face was hairless, but the rest of his head was covered with thick fur."
0,Alert canine ears twitched atop his head.
0,"He wore tight leather armor that helped cleave the wind around him, leaving his long, hairy tail fluttering behind."
0,"Lycon digitigrade legs were not unlike a spriggan’s, and had she not seen his head and tail, she might have suspected him of being a spriggan solely from his body shape."
0,"Zose approached, and the lycon embraced him, sniffing his neck."
0,"As ceil waited for the exchange, several lycon appeared from the rocks above the pass."
0,"“Friend of lycon, you may pass.”"
1,"Zose beckoned his party to follow, and they entered the pass."
0,"Unlike the Nuanae range, the Nuafonen was much shorter, but the paths were far steeper."
0,"Despite Dyson’s struggle to carry Ceil for the length, they cleared it in a single day."
0,"From Zose’s explanation, this pass was where the Nuafonen range was thinnest."
0,"The pass the formal road traveled would have taken two or three days, most likely three or more with Ceil’s condition."
0,They made camp on the other side before near-identical plains aside from what appeared to be ruins jutting from the snow in the distance.
0,They seemed familiar.
0,"As Ceil pondered on them, she made the connection."
0,They looked just like the ruins rising from the flatlands of western Vallen.
0,"“They are the same,” Jeddin explained in place of Zose who was once again on first watch because they were in lycon territory."
0,“The topology of the wilderlands does not begin with the Nuanae.
0,The flatlands of Vallen and the Filinceil plains are a part.
0,Buried beneath them you will find the same ruins.
0,You would have seen ruins along the road had we taken it over the plains.
0,"Legends say the land was far less mountainous in ages long past, but the gods grew angry and scarred the continent."
0,It is believed that the ancient civilization was the cause.”
0,"“Your destination, the Afarit, is at the epicenter,” Dyson added."
0,"“It was the location of the ancient civilization’s capital, a city once larger and grander than any existing in the world today.”"
0,“Is the Afarit a people or a place?” Ceil asked.
0,"“Both,” Jeddin replied."
0,"“It is a name given them by others, although no one can remember whether they were named for the location or the location for them."
0,They are cousins of us spriggans but more at home in fire wastes than forests.
0,"They are not the ancients, if you were wondering."
0,No tales have survived of the people from that time as if their history was destroyed with their civilization.”
0,"Ceil heard Zose’s whistle, and Coby cried out in annoyance of it, growing tired of hearing it constantly over the past day."
0,He trotted over to Ceil and enveloped her in his wings as if to protect her from the beastkin he associated with the whistle.
0,"“Sleep,” Jeddin ordered."
0,“We will leave at first light.”
0,Jeddin nestled down for sleep himself because he would replace Zose at next watch.
0,"Dyson was allowed to sleep through the night like Ceil because of his role as her carrier, but despite Jeddin’s order for Dyson to sleep as well, he stayed awake staring out in the approximate direction of Sen’uon far from view, at least until Ceil fell asleep and could no longer watch him."
0,"Bursters were far less frequent between the Nuafonen and Hemenonan, but in exchange the winds were overall faster."
0,"The benefit of Zose’s route was that they could travel perpendicular to or with the wind whereas if they took the road, much of the way to Sen’uon was against the wind."
0,"The distance across the plains was not much shorter than the last, but without needing to wait out constant bursters, they traveled much greater distances in less time."
0,"And without frequent bursters, Coby managed the wind just fine."
0,"For their single camp on the plains, they used ancient ruins, much to Ceil’s relief."
0,A roof overhead and surrounding walls helped her feel secure for the first night since she left Zose’s home in Ib’nua.
0,"That morning she felt for the first time crossing the plains that she had the energy to set out, if only her injured body was able to carry her."
0,"Only one more day across the plains, a flight over Sen’uon, and then she would finally enter the Afarit."
0,Her eagerness for the journey to be over made her forget the days of travel that were still needed after passing Sen’uon before reaching the Afarit.
1,"As they crossed the last stretch of frigid plains, the ruins grew in number and density."
0,Crumbled towers and walls of structures scattered across the plains all buried deep into the soil.
0,"In the distance, a mountain ridgeline rose."
0,"The Nuafonen was steep, but the Hemenonan was steeper still, like a jagged wall created by an impossibly powerful earth mage."
0,"As they neared, Ceil could see the plains rise as if the cliff bent them upwards along its face."
0,Closer still she noticed ruins protruding from the face of the mountains as if the plains themselves were upheaved into the cliffs.
0,"These ruins were unburied, crumbling off the mountainsides in their steep slants."
0,"She had seen the similarities between the Temple of the Gods in Amel and Revlan, but here she noticed that the crumbling architecture was not too dissimilar to the Amelian Palace, as if the palace was constructed using the ruins of the wilderlands as vague inspiration."
0,"“This is as far as we go,” Zose announced."
0,“We will send Gein from here.”
0,Zose led them to shelter among the ruins at the face of the steep mountain cliffs.
0,A discernable road approached from the east lined with obelisks and then turned up through a ravine in the mountains.
0,"“Sen’uon is just beyond, and if we approach any nearer, Lurr are bound to notice,” he explained."
0,“They tend not to leave the safety of the mountains.”
0,"“We should travel through the city together,” Dyson protested again after setting Ceil down."
0,"“Why are you so adamant about passing through the city,” Jeddin prodded."
0,"“Because it would be safer,” Dyson half-shouted."
0,"“We have made our decision,” Zose said."
0,Dyson grumbled and paced around the circular room.
0,“Then send me to meet Gein on the other side.”
0,"“No,” Ceil refused quickly."
0,"Dyson froze and looked at her, shocked and betrayed."
0,She did not want to say she lacked trust in him after the days he carried her--quite the opposite--but she could not explain it another way.
0,She felt conflicted.
0,"While Zose and Jeddin acted professional in all things pertaining to her and escorting her north, Dyson was different."
0,"He was clearly infatuated, and though gentlemanly aside from his annoying flirtatious quips, the difference in treatment he gave her left a lingering feeling of doubt itching in her mind."
0,"“It will take half a day or longer for Zose and Jeddin to catch up, and I do not want to be alone with you for that long."
0,"Please understand,” Ceil finally said."
0,"“Maybe if you were not so persistent in gaining her affection, she would trust you more,” Jeddin chided with a sideways glance."
0,"I do trust him, she wanted to retort, but she swallowed her words."
0,Zose and Jeddin planned where Coby would carry Ceil with Zose making the final decision and then had Ceil explain the location in detail to Coby.
0,Jeddin then left for Sen’uon and their meeting point beyond the city.
0,"After some time of pensive waiting, Dyson also left."
0,“I have business in Sen’uon.
0,Perhaps I will meet you with Jeddin on the other side.”
1,Ceil watched Dyson leave with a tinge of regret.
0,He was accompanying Ceil for her sake without requesting payment.
0,"He went out of his way to care for her, and yet she sided with Jeddin’s plan, her suggestion, over his."
0,She started questioning whether she had made the correct choice.
0,"As the sun set, the time came for Zose to send Ceil off."
0,They climbed the steps to the second story of the ruins where the ceiling and walls had long crumbled.
0,Ceil was bundled and laid in her cloak.
0,Zose then tied the ends and bound them in cords to give holds for Coby’s talons.
0,"“Make haste,” Zose said as Coby rose into the air with a powerful flap of his massive wings."
0,"Zose readied his supplies, slung Ceil staff over his back, and ran up the road towards Sen’uon."
0,"At the narrow pass, a mob of guards blocked his path."
0,"“Are you Zose,” one of them called, a mostly-troll Lurr of massive stature as if part giant."
0,"“I am,” he replied with anxiety pricking the back of his mind."
0,"“I am sorry, but the Lord of Sen’uon has forbidden your passage.”"
0,It was then that Zose realized he had made a terrible mistake.
0,* * *
1,"Of the few times Ceil had been carried by Coby, this was the worst."
0,The frozen winds of the high altitudes cut deeper to her core than even the plains despite her bundled layers.
0,She was painfully curled up on her back and could only look up at Coby above her as she swayed in his grasp.
0,"She could not see where she was going, and the ever-darkening night worsened both her fears and sea-drunkenness."
0,At least snow was not falling or Ceil would fear Coby might miss their destination.
0,"The swift flight only took an hour, and Ceil counted out every second in her mind."
0,She finally felt the altitude decrease and regretted not choosing Dyson to receive her on the other side to warm her immediately.
0,Hopefully he would be waiting for her with Jeddin.
1,"Coby landed a bit harder than Ceil’s injuries could handle because of the curled position she was forced to endure for the hour, and she cried out weakly."
0,"Coby released her and hopped back, picking at the cords with his beak to free her."
0,Jeddin nudged him away and cut them.
0,"He then unraveled her from the spare cloaks Zose bundled her in to keep her warm, but she quickly covered herself in them again."
0,Her jaw quivered and her teeth clattered.
0,She did not know how to use life magic to heat her body because she was never expected to need such magic.
0,Coby instead enveloped her in his wings.
0,"“F-f-fire,” Ceil begged."
0,"“No, not this close to Sen’uon.”"
0,"Ceil cursed Jeddin in her mind, but she understood."
0,"Up the road back towards Sen’uon, Ceil noticed someone running towards them."
0,She about called to Jeddin in case he had not noticed but then realized it was Dyson.
0,"Relief welled within her, and that same relief showed on Dyson’s face."
0,"“You are safe,” he said, a little winded."
0,"“Why wouldn’t she be,” Jeddin replied, but Dyson could not answer."
0,“Can you warm Gein?
0,She is suffering from hypothermia.”
0,“Of course.” Dyson rushed over and knelt before Ceil.
1,A pair of glowing red eyes appeared from the rocks in the distance.
0,“Dyson!” Ceil called but too late.
0,An arrow struck Dyson’s back quickly followed by a second.
0,Dyson pushed Ceil to the ground away from him before a third hit.
0,Coby scrambled out from under Ceil and flapped into the air only to have a net tossed over him from behind.
0,The one who tossed the net was Jeddin.
0,“Coby!” Ceil cried.
0,"Jeddin spun and kicked Dyson across the face, sending him crumbling back onto the road."
0,"Without wasting any motion, he stomped Ceil in the stomach."
0,"Her breath erupted from her throat, and she could taste blood in her mouth."
0,"She gasped for the air that her lungs could not find, unable to cry out from the pain of her former injuries."
0,"The Lurr from the shadows walked onto the road, another arrow nocked and ready to fire."
0,He was too afraid to approach any closer to Ceil.
0,"“Brother, get away from that monster before it gets you,” the Lurr pleaded to Jeddin."
0,"“Deinan,” Dyson spat, blood spilling from his mouth."
0,"“Curse you, Jeddin!"
0,I knew you were scheming!”
0,The readied arrow fired into Dyson’s chest.
0,Ceil cried out for him through her winded breath.
0,“You knew but did nothing?” Jeddin shook his head.
0,“Deinan said you were snooping.
0,"You were unsure; that is all, so you did not want to create doubt within our party if you might have been wrong."
0,"If you suspected, you should have told Zose."
0,"There are no friends among hunter mercenaries, Dyson."
0,You are too good-natured.” He glanced down at Ceil beside him.
0,“This is the widow of Emperor Yuro.
0,"With this woman dead, no one else has to die because of her.”"
0,Ceil recalled in a flash the day she first met Jeddin and Dyson.
0,Jeddin was close with the elf girl who had been mistaken for her and killed.
0,"From the rocks, more red eyes appeared and crowded the road."
0,Ceil quickly pulled her knife and began cutting at the net trapping Coby.
0,Jeddin noticed and kicked Ceil in the side.
0,"The pain was unbearable, and Ceil’s consciousness slipped for a moment."
0,"Coby struggled harder under the net, and when one of his wings had the slightest bit of movement, his wind cut through."
0,"He rose into the air with an enormous flap, drawing the attention of all the Lurr."
0,"“Flee,” Ceil screamed to Coby the best she could."
0,“Find Zose.”
0,Coby hesitated but then flew high into the sky the moment the Lurr barraged him with magic.
0,Nothing could touch him in his ascent.
0,Jeddin stomped on Ceil again.
0,"“Gein!” Dyson conjured a roaring flame, but the Lurr spriggan grabbed him by his thick hair and carved a knife across his neck."
0,"The fire in Dyson’s hand dispersed, and he was kicked to the road."
0,The Lurr swarmed.
0,Ceil watched in gruesome horror as they slowly tore Dyson apart and devoured him in front of her.
0,"More than terror, Ceil seethed."
0,Another had died because of her.
0,She felt the same from his death as she had when she thought Eydis had died in the assassinations.
0,She felt the same as when she saw Sammy impaled by the spear in Revlan.
0,She hated that she doubted him when he only ever had her best interests at heart.
0,She knew his quips about her fictitious consort skills were never meant in earnest.
0,He had always been true.
0,The gruesome scene ate at her.
0,"It overwhelmed her, but instead of drowning in sorrow, she wanted to curse Jeddin."
0,She wanted to kill him.
0,A swift death would be too kind.
0,She wanted him to suffer.
0,Ceil reached for Jeddin’s nearby ankle.
0,"If she could only touch him, she knew that deathly skeletal hand would grant her wish."
0,“Brother!” Deinan rushed to Jeddin and pulled him away from Ceil with such ferocity that they tumbled to the ground together.
0,"The Lurr’s terrified eyes glowed bright red in the dark, brighter than Ceil had ever seen, enough to tint the frozen earth around her red."
0,Jeddin separated himself from Deinan.
0,He looked at the numerous Lurr around the road.
0,They all had cowered the moment Ceil reached out her hand towards him.
0,“What did you see?”
0,“An apparition of death.
0,The monster reached for you through that woman.
0,Its presence is powerful.
0,"The sight of it choked my heart, and I felt I was nothing."
0,No Lurr can stand against that.”
0,Jeddin eyed Deinan’s cryptic words with doubt.
0,He had born personal witness to Ceil’s weakness and frailty.
0,"He grabbed Deinan’s bow because his was beside Ceil, but Deinan stopped him."
0,“No!
0,"The Lord wants her alive, and I fear what might happen if that thing within her is released.”"
0,"The ground slowly blackened around Ceil, and as Jeddin watched, the blight grew and extended further."
0,Stone grew brittle and crumbled.
0,Plants blackened and turned to dust.
0,He grabbed a large stone from the roadside.
0,Ceil glared at him in pure hatred as he threw it at her head.
1,Kep flitted down from above the road and spun around Jeddin.
0,"“Well, this’s unfortunate."
0,Are we going to have to negotiate with the Lord of Sen’uon to be able to claim her bounty?
0,That chimera gives me the creeps.”
0,"“I do not care about the bounty,” Jeddin spat."
0,"“So long as you can assure me that it is collected, you can split my share.”"
0,"“You really liked that elf girl from Ib’nua,” Kep chuckled."
0,“I’ll inform Inym of our success.
0,"Deinan, have the Lurr keep an eye out for Zose."
0,No number of guards can stop him from entering a city of stone.”
0,* * *
1,"Ceil awoke to powerful and painful shivers, but they were not from the cold."
0,"The air around her and the stone beneath her were quite warm, and after enduring cold for so long the heat wrought havoc on every injured nerve in her body."
0,"Ceil lay on the hard floor able to move but lacking the will to do so, staring at the pointed arch ceiling of an ancient and grand hall."
0,"She could not understand much of the conversation between Jeddin and Deinan, only picking out a few words and phrases that were similar enough to Elven, so she entirely expected to be killed, but instead she lived again while another died."
0,"Her wrath towards Jeddin was gone, replaced by numb emptiness."
0,"She was past feeling now, accepting the reality that so long as she lived others would die because of her."
0,There was no longer any point in fighting her fate.
0,There was no longer any point in mourning her fate.
0,"She was done fighting, done resisting, done struggling, hurting, crying, feeling, done living."
0,"A little magic, simple life magic--that is all it would take."
0,Ceil placed her hand on the side of her head.
0,"It would be painless, peaceful, and then no one else would die."
0,The Sprite Archon was not here to stop her.
0,"There was no one left alive who would care enough to stop her, at least care enough about her, not her position or identity or what purpose chosen for her that she would accomplish in the future."
0,No one remained who would stop her for her sake.
0,"But, she couldn’t do it."
0,Ceil let her hand fall slack beside her head.
0,She didn’t know if she was just too weak-willed or if in her numbness she simply did not care enough to end her life anymore.
0,She only stared at the ceiling in the sickly-warm stone room as an unknown number of hours passed by.
1,"The sound of strange steps echoed in the hall, like large bare feet accompanied by scraping and clacking, but the clacking was not from wood or metal."
0,"As the sound neared, Ceil realized that the approaching being was much larger than any elf or troll or giant."
0,Claws on its feet scraped across the stone at the rise of each step.
0,"Each step was followed by that odd clack, as if someone was walking with two staves."
0,She could hear the rhythmic thump of a powerful heartbeat.
0,Ceil opened her eyes out of curiosity to see the monster that might end her life for her.
0,"It was about thrice the length a giant was tall, and its tail was longer still."
0,"It was so gaunt that it appeared as if its smooth hide clung directly to its bones, allowing Ceil to see the shape and pulsing of each organ in its narrow core."
0,Each of its bony arms had two elbows.
0,The fore-elbow was bent so that it grasped its own arm with its long fingers.
0,Protruding from that elbow was a long spike or horn that it used to walk or support its long upper body.
0,The only loose skin on its body hung from its long neck where at the end sat a sparsely hairy head with strands of long silver hair hanging and dragging on the floor.
0,"Its face was a mix of all races from elf to human to beastkin, but its jaw split into three distinct mandibles."
0,"The moment she looked at it, she felt as if its very presence pressed her into the floor."
0,There was an immense weight in its glowing red eyes.
0,"This was a chimera, but not just any chimera."
0,"Ceil did not know how she knew, but this being was ancient."
0,"The chimera’s neck elongated, stretching the sagging skin taut, and brought its head near."
0,"It looked Ceil over, inspecting her from many angles."
0,"Its breath was pleasant, like freshly tilled soil ready for sowing."
0,She was not scared.
0,"Ceil reached up for the hope of death that it brought, but the moment her fingers extended, the creature vanished."
0,"Ceil blinked her eyes, wondering if she had seen a phantom or illusion."
0,"For the first time since she woke up in the grand hall, she lifted her head to look around."
0,"Thin, pointed arch windows along its length glowed with the radiant orange of flame, both lighting and warming the hall."
0,"She had not cared to notice before, but the grand hall was exquisite."
0,It was not a throne room but possibly a banquet hall cleared of all furnishings.
0,"Although antiquated, the architecture bore similarity to the halls of the Amelian palace."
0,It only lacked the intricate elven carvings and over-embellished Amelian flair.
0,"She spotted it--or him, now that she saw him in full view."
0,His hands no longer gripped his arm but clung to the far corner of the ceiling like an insect.
0,This creature had jumped to the ceiling so quickly her eyes could not see it.
0,"Once again, his neck elongated to about twice the length of his sizable body, worming in the air as he inspected Ceil from a distance this time."
0,He did not show fear of her like the other Lurr.
0,"She was not sure if she could correctly interpret his expressions, but he seemed curious of her."
0,"“Am I to be your breeding bed,” Ceil asked, voicing the sole worry on her mind of a fate worse than death."
0,"“She speaks,” the chimera answered."
0,"“I worried that your head injury may have ruined your mind and I could get no answer to your existence.” His voice was deep but smooth, an impossible feat, Ceil thought, for one without a common mouth and lacking a tongue."
0,"As he spoke, his three mandibles did not move, but his long throat undulated, somehow perfectly mimicking the sound of speech."
0,"“I have no more need of offspring, and the one behind you would never let me touch you."
0,"We repel each other--opposites, he and I.”"
0,"“He?” Ceil tried sitting, but her core burned with pain, so she remained laying on the hard stone floor."
0,“Are you not aware?
0,"Have you not seen the apparition that you bear, the very Aspect of Death?”"
0,"“You can see it?” Ceil asked, surprised."
0,"“A grim skeletal form of a man, human.”"
0,"Ceil’s heart raced, and she forced herself to sit despite her pain."
0,“It is human?
0,Did they curse me with this?”
0,"“I have devoured countless over the ages, so many that I can no longer endure the taste of flesh."
0,I know the bones of all races.
0,"Yes, he is human, but of an ancient kind, an ancestor, one of the first civilization in whose ruins we now reside.”"
0,"“The ancient civilization was human, not elf?” Ceil was taught in the palace that high elves were the eldest race."
0,"Then again, they never taught that Amel once belonged to the humans before they were driven out into Tolmyur."
0,“Yes.” The chimera climbed down slowly from his corner of the ceiling and crawled his lanky body across the floor.
0,"Although he approached, he kept his extended face from Ceil."
0,"“Yes,” he repeated."
0,"“A civilization emboldened by the power of their god-king, Surmal, to commit the greatest of atrocities, to kill the gods that created them."
0,Their king was no god but a man who had obtained the secret to immortality--a task all too simple for the pride it gave him--and he used his long life across the ages to amass power.
0,"But he was not content, no."
0,"He delved into taboo, seeking out the knowledge of countless other worlds to further his power, and when warned to cease by the two gods of this world, he turned his power against them."
0,"He did not know that the created could never harm their creator, for such is natural law."
0,"The gods punished him and destroyed all he had built in his long, ageless life, creating what you now call the barren wilderlands from what was once the most fertile of all Whinhlem."
0,"He was not without some success, however, for even though he could not harm his creator, he ripped the other from godhood, and in so doing was killed for his crime before he could kill the god.”"
0,"Ceil had thought that Jeddin’s tale about how the ancient people angered the gods was just a fable, but now hearing the same tale from one who was just as ancient or possibly more ancient than the past civilization, the story could not be a lie."
0,Perhaps Jeddin learned of it because his brother was a Lurr living in Sen’uon.
0,“Who are you?”
0,"“I am Ni’inca Ab’pul, the first of my kind to be brought to Whinhlem by my creator when my former world collapsed."
0,All the Lurr of Whinhlem are my descendants.”
0,"If not for the knowledge that Sammy and her companions were from another world, Ceil would not have believed what she heard."
0,"If this chimera was not of Whinhlem, what was her connection to him?"
0,"Why was this ancient human attached to her, and what made them opposites?"
0,She asked.
0,"“I do not know why such an apparition possesses you, and that is what I want to learn, if possible."
0,Your existence is an anomaly.
0,"Lurr was my creator, and so I gave our kind that name."
0,"Lurr was not of the corporeal, not of physical existence nor elemental."
0,"Lurr was a concept taken form unto itself, given will of itself, an embodiment, an Aspect of Being."
0,"You carry with you the Aspect of Death, but Lurr was the Aspect of Life, a godly existence of purpose to find the means to surpass the limits of creation."
0,"By the very air and stone that slowly withers around you, your sole purpose is the end of creation."
0,"Should you linger in my lands for long, I do not doubt the very land would grow barren and die.”"
0,The three-year famine of the Filinceil plains…
0,Events of Ceil’s past found connection in the chimera’s words.
0,That famine began shortly after she was born and her family moved to Heivleil and lingered for over a year after she was brought to the Amelian palace.
0,"All those towns that suffered, all those who starved and died, it was because she was there."
0,"Those words now affirmed what Ceil had felt all along: so long as she lived, others would die."
0,"“Kill me,” Ceil begged."
0,“I am too weak to do it myself.
0,Please kill me!”
0,"“The Aspect of Death is bound to you, and as you weaken its presence grows stronger."
0,Its purpose is the end of all creation.
0,"I know not how or why, but bound to you its effects are limited."
0,You are its prison.
0,I fear what may happen should your death release it.”
0,"Each time the apparition took action, it always acted through her hand or other form of contact, similar to life magic."
0,The chimera’s words bore an immense weight.
0,"Ceil wanted to die to end the deaths that would inevitably continue because of her existence, but should she die, the Aspect of Death could cause even greater destruction."
0,Ceil had no tears to cry.
0,"She laughed a numb, empty laugh."
0,The Sprite Arkhon was just as ancient as this Chimera.
0,He had his foresight.
0,He knew everything about her already.
0,"She finally understood the title the sprites bestowed upon her, the Herald of Calamity."
0,She had no choice but to exist as a plague upon the world.
0,"“What will you do with me if I cannot die, cannot stay, and cannot be used for breeding?"
0,Are you going to set me free?”
0,"“Others seek your life, and that is a greater immediate threat than the harm your presence will eventually cause Sen’uon."
0,I have an army of Lurr under my command.
0,"Those who pursue you will not have you, and your friends will not take you from the safety of my halls."
0,The chimera vanished down a corridor to the right of the hall as quickly as when he jumped to the corner of the ceiling.
0,You are my prisoner until a time I can learn how to deal with the Aspect of Death within you.”
0,"Ceil knew Zose and Coby would be looking for her, and should they encounter this Chimera, they would be killed before they ever saw his approach."
0,There was nothing she could do to stop him.
0,Ceil collapsed to her back and stared up at the grand hall’s ceiling.
0,Chapter 12
0,“The Guarded Lurr City of Stone”
1,Traveling against the wind on the last day on the plains proved nigh impossible for one of Byurk’s stature.
0,"Even with upheaved stone boosting each step, the blustering gales threatened to carry him back down the road the other way if he so much as lost the slightest focus or misstepped."
0,Numerous times Thanysa had to grab his cloak to root him.
0,"By midday, Byurk devised a plan to use a thin wedge of stone to cut the wind around them, and together they shared the burden of pushing the wedge trapped in the tight confines with Thanysa standing over him."
0,"They progressed faster with their combined magic, but the exertion of earth magic was no less exhausting."
0,"No doubt Thanysa would have wished for Byurk to be carried away by the winds across the plains into the unknown to die in the frozen wilds, especially after conquering and purging her city, but she never brought up the topic nor let her inner ire show on the surface."
0,"She was a soldier devoted to her obligations, never letting personal feelings hinder the rescue of the widow of the emperor, and Byurk respected her all the more for it."
0,"Byurk knew he would ultimately be punished for his role in Vallen, but until that day came or he found means to avoid it, he felt he could trust Thanysa as much as any one of his men."
1,"Once inside the ruins sloping up the steep mountain face, Thanysa requested pause in the windbreak so they could recover energy and ven."
0,"The narrow pass up into the mountain was in sight, and they would be upon Sen’uon soon."
0,"Without knowing what they might encounter in a Lurr city, Thanysa wanted to be prepared."
0,Byurk hunkered down in the corner of a small crumbling abode and removed his sack of provisions.
0,"He handed Thanysa a strip of dried meat, and she in turn passed him the water skin."
0,The water was warm--Thanysa kept the water skin under her armor close to her core--so it helped take the edge off the chill.
0,"“Thank you for your assistance against the winds,” Byurk said, handing back the water skin."
0,"Thanysa did not reply or even acknowledge his words, but he expected as such."
0,“How long do you need to recover your ven?”
0,"“I should be sufficient by evening,” she replied now that the topic of conversation changed to their mission."
0,“Humans are slower in their recovery.
0,Do you require longer?”
0,"“Humans are, but minums are not,” Byurk replied, wanting to correct her for her general use of human for all the races of Tolmyur."
0,“We are not unlike you elves in that respect.”
0,"“Trolls are different than elves,” Thanysa replied mimicking Byurk’s light rebuke."
0,"“We are slower in our recovery, so if you are equal to elves, we should be ready by nightfall.”"
1,Byurk patted the stone to send a pulse to wake Thanysa against the far wall.
0,"The sun had set, and the time for departure arrived."
0,"Thanysa roused quickly, and they set out without a word only a few seconds later."
0,"Approaching a potentially hostile city at night was worrisome, but neither of them wanted to delay."
0,"The widow’s party would have reached Sen’uon five days ago, and if the plot Inym mentioned was real, the widow might already be captured or worse."
0,"Basara held immense faith in her husband’s skill, so she trusted he could protect the girl until they arrived, but when Lurr were involved, there were limits to what one single oread could accomplish."
0,Thanysa’s night vision was better than Byurk’s but still not as powerful as a spriggan’s.
0,"Byurk’s earth magic was of the school of manipulation, not conjuration, so he could sense the surrounding area through the earth beneath him."
0,"Thanysa could employ both manipulation and conjuration, but her manipulation was much weaker."
0,"At night, Byurk could affectively see better than her."
0,"He hoped that the clouds would thin to let faint moonlight pass through, but he knew that was a fool’s hope."
0,"Like every night previous, the plains were dark."
0,Byurk followed the feeling of the obelisks lining the road and led Thanysa to the pass.
0,"Neither of them knew what to expect, and Basara never informed them about Sen’uon’s defenses or level of guard."
1,Thanysa grabbed Byurk by the back of his cloak.
0,“Something approaches.
0,Multiple.”
0,"Byurk forgot about one of Thanysa’s senses that far surpassed his, her hearing."
0,She picked up on someone long before his earth magic.
0,"After a moment of pause, he felt six distinct pairs of footsteps, one quite large."
0,"They did not approach in hostility, at least that he could tell."
0,Soon there were others.
0,"“Two on the rocks above on the left, three on the right,” he informed."
0,"A deep voice called out from up the pass, but Byurk did not know the language."
0,He was more familiar with the tongues of the eastern wilderlands.
0,"“We request passage to Sen’uon,” Thanysa called in Elven."
0,"“You travel without light to approach the city,” the voice replied in perfect Elven."
0,“What business do you have here?”
0,"“The plains have been harsh,” Byurk replied."
0,“We lost our light on our journey.
0,"We are earth mages, so the stony road is our eyes.”"
0,Firelight lit in the distance illuminating the six bodies.
0,"The one in the center holding the flame was a massive troll as tall as a giant, perhaps a Lurr combination of those two races."
0,He alone approached.
0,“You are not of the wilderlands.
0,"What business do you have here,” he repeated."
0,"“We only seek provisions and shelter to recover from the plains as we travel north for the Afarit,” Thanysa replied."
0,Byurk cursed Thanysa’s ignorance.
0,The guard was now too close for them to make use of fabrications.
0,The Lurr raised his unlit hand.
0,Weapons unsheathed from the rocks above.
0,Two of the bodies in the distance down the road drew their bows.
0,“I will ask again.
0,You cannot lie to a Lurr’s ears.”
0,Byurk stepped forward.
0,“Forgive the error of my companion.
0,She is not of the wilderlands as you say.
0,"My origins are of the eastern wilderlands, but I am familiar with the customs of you and yours."
0,"My commander has placed a bounty on an individual, and I have received word this individual has either passed through Sen’uon or is contained there."
0,I am here to ascertain the status of that claim.”
0,"The demeanor of the Lurr changed, but in the dark firelight Byurk could not tell if the change was positive."
0,"He spoke the truth, and the Lurr should know."
0,"“You, minum, are from Tolmyur.”"
0,Byurk parted his winter cloak to reveal his Tolmyurin armor and general insignia above his right breast.
0,"He felt this would earn them passage so that the enormous bounty could be claimed, but instead the bodies on the rocks began to move."
0,"“Under orders of Ni’inca Ab’pul, Lord of Sen’uon, all those who desire Ceil, widow of Yuro, are to be repelled or killed whether ally to her or enemy.”"
0,Byurk and Thanysa immediately hardened their bodies.
0,Arrows flew and bounced off them or got stuck in their armor.
0,"The Lurr troll threw the fire in his hand at Byurk, but he had an earthen wall raised before it made impact."
0,"The mild explosion showered them in shrapnel, and their light vanished."
0,"Three Lurr jumped down from the rock, the red of their eyes barely visible in the dark."
0,Thanysa conjured two stone blades and parried the swift attack of a Lurr’s sword.
0,The force of the enemy blade shattered Thanysa’s weapon on second impact.
0,"Byurk was a mage, ill-practiced in martial combat, so he had little choice but to let Thanysa be vanguard."
0,"He hesitated to use his water magic, his highest proficiency, due to the frigid weather."
0,"Should they get wet, they could die of hypothermia."
0,He was unsure if the more resilient Lurr had the same weakness.
0,He could not conjure ice due to a difference in his water affinity attunement and specialization.
0,"With only earth manipulation as his available weapon, the support he could provide was limited."
0,"He thrust a spike from the left rock face to impale a Lurr approaching from Thanysa’s flank, but the Lurr dodged it with its superior agility."
0,"Byurk could not see, but it was likely part spriggan or similar."
0,Byurk felt one of the Lurr troll’s hands touch the ground.
0,"“The large one is charging,” Byurk warned."
0,He conjured a wall in front of the Lurr just as the Lurr took off.
0,The wall did not slow down the massive body in the slightest.
0,All the other Lurr quickly cleared away off the narrow pass.
0,"Byurk readied a spike hoping to impale the Lurr, but he knew the momentum would still send the Lurr straight through them, injured or not."
0,"The road was too narrow to dodge the massive body, and they could not outrun him."
0,"Just as Byurk was about to release the spike from beneath the ground, Thanysa kicked her foot back into the road."
0,"A column of stone several yards in length shot back from under Byurk, launching him into the air."
0,The last sensation Byurk felt before his feet left the stone was the massive body colliding with Thanysa.
1,"He spun in darkness through the air out of the pass, and the powerful wind immediately caught him."
0,It blew him east and downward until he collided with one of the many ruins and tumbled onto the frozen ground.
0,"“Every single time,” Byurk cursed, having been thrown again."
0,"He knew immediately his right forearm was broken despite his reinforcement magic, and he had a light sprain in his left ankle, but he survived."
0,"If he had landed on his head and not his arm, he would have been in far worse shape, but he knew he fared better than Thanysa who could never contend with a troll-giant Lurr on her own."
0,Byurk struggled to his feet ignoring the pain and rushed back towards the pass.
0,He had flown much further than he thought in the high winds.
0,He must have caught a burster while in the air.
0,It took him the better part of an hour fighting against the wind between the ruins to return to the pass.
0,"He felt the surrounding area through the ground to search for both Thanysa and any Lurr who might be searching for him, but he held little hope for her."
0,"She saved him, and he could not comprehend why."
1,"Not far from where the road rose into the narrow pass, Byurk felt the presence of a body lying on the ground off the road."
0,"Given its location in the craggy rock face, it was either dumped there or hiding."
0,"He hurried to the location and found Thanysa barely coherent, so broken that he wondered how she still lived."
0,He grabbed her and dragged her away from the pass and further potential danger into the ruins far west of the road.
0,There he laid her and covered her with his cloak.
0,"“Did you escape or were you dumped there,” he asked, needing to know how likely the Lurr would be searching for them."
0,"“Escaped,” Thanysa replied through a blood-seeping mouth."
0,“I would be devoured otherwise.”
0,Byurk removed the near-empty water skin from Thanysa’s armor and lifted her head to let her drink and wash out the blood.
0,“Do not waste it.
0,"Keep it,” she ordered."
0,"“Why would you protect me,” Byurk asked."
0,"“Your life is more important than my own,” Thanysa replied."
0,“Your status as my enemy and your past crimes are of little importance now.
0,"You, a friend of Jethro and General of Tolmyur, will have a better chance than any to persuade Jethro to spare Lady Ceil.”"
0,Her words hurt Byurk’s pride as a commander of Tolmyur.
0,He exhaled long and slow.
0,She was as pure in her devotion to her duty as he had thought.
0,He could not abandon such valiance.
0,He checked his small bag of provisions.
0,"“We have food for only a day more, two if rationed."
0,Basara’s party will arrive in four days at their pace.”
0,“I need no food or drink.”
0,"“I will not permit you to die here,” Byurk said."
0,“I will not die.
0,I will hibernate.
0,Entomb and insulate me in stone.
0,In that state my body will heat and protect me from the cold.
0,"I will not need nourishment, nor will I need much air."
0,Use our remaining provisions and bring warning to our party.”
0,“You trust me not to escape or take action on my own?”
0,"“Before taking you into our company, Basara promised on her life that your honor could be trusted."
0,I will hold you to that honor on your Boromek name.”
1,Byurk cursed Basara as he ran half-carried by the wind back down the road.
0,"He was originally an exile of Tolmyur, last of the noble Boromek house who stood in opposition to the oppressive Tolmyur king."
0,He was raised from youth by a clan of dwarves in the wilderlands north of the Stollmuk Kingdom.
0,The dwarves instilled in him a strong sense of honor and taught him to take pride in his people and heritage.
0,"Like Basara, he was once a hunter mercenary with Jethro, lacking the same blind nationalism as the other soldiers and officers of Tolmyur."
0,"While he strongly felt that the Amelian Empire should pay for their betrayal of the humans and crimes against Tolmyur, he also knew that many of the actions taken by Jethro and Tolmyur in this war were unjust."
0,"Given his position, he had to follow through with those orders despite his personal feelings."
0,Basara saw that in him and must have revealed his past to the Vallen party.
0,"This did not absolve him of his crimes, only showing that with a common aim he could be trusted to his role."
0,Only now did he realize that this was why he was never bound or treated as a prisoner as they traveled north.
0,"In his ignorance he assumed they simply did not fear him because of Basara and Chloe’s presence, although that still may have been part."
0,"Even though Byurk was Vallen’s enemy, they were not his."
0,"Knowing the true weight of the widow’s life, he was fully prepared to do his part and help the Vallen party in any way he could."
0,"For now, he needed to warn the party about Sen’uon and save that admirable troll’s life."
0,* * *
1,"During camp, Inym often sat far from the three separate groups despite their assurance that she should join them."
0,"She did not want to associate with the Tolmyur soldiers or the Vallen soldiers, and the diverse gathering of races with Basara was even less enticing, mostly because Basara was there."
0,Inym sat huddled in the rocks of the ravine beside the camp wrapped in a thicker fur cloak given her out of sympathy or perhaps pity.
0,She drank her meal that was stewed to mush over the fire by the troll soldier.
0,They were oddly considerate of her.
0,"Right as Inym lay down to sleep for the night, she heard a faint whisper."
0,She resisted the urge to startle and continued acting as if she was readying to sleep.
0,"“Kep, where have you been,” Inym whispered back."
0,She could not see Kep and did not worry that others in the camp might.
0,That pixie was skilled at staying hidden.
0,“I should ask you the same.
0,I have been searching for you for four days.
0,Never thought you would be in this aberrant party.
0,I passed you three times.
0,"If you were going to use a new cloak, you should have at least worn your old one on the outside.”"
0,“That’s not important.
0,What happened in Sen’uon?”
0,"“Bad news, or at least another complication."
0,Lord Ab’pul has taken possession of our target.”
0," “What of Zose,” Inym asked, worried of what might happen if her plan killed Basara’s husband now that they were in company together."
0,"“He disappeared, but we managed to kill Dyson.”"
0,Inym could not yet breathe a sigh of relief.
0,“Is the girl alive?”
0,“I do not know.”
0,"“Did you leave the very second the Lurr claimed the girl,” Inym hissed."
0,“You should have investigated first.
0,Are all the stories of your skill fabricated?”
0,"“You are the one who ordered me to return immediately when any unforeseen conditions arose,” Kep replied, unperturbed."
0,Inym breathed her frustration out her nose.
0,“I have an unforeseen condition of my own.
0,The girl’s life is far too grave a risk.
0,We need to call off the mission and rescue her from Sen’uon.”
0,Kep left her hiding place among the rocks and flitted down in front of Inym’s face.
0,Her cheerful demeanor vanished.
0,“You cannot be serious.
0,"I took this job without pay upfront, flew all over the frozen wilderlands for days on end under your orders, and you want to call it off?"
0,"Are you going to be able to pay me for my services, you who have lived the past years in a shack reading postage for Jit?”"
0,"Kep looked over Inym’s head to the rest of the camp, her vision lingering on the Tolmyur soldiers."
0,“You are leading Tolmyur to Sen’uon.
0,That is why you covered yourself to avoid me.
0,You never intended on sharing the bounty with any of us.”
0,“Don’t be foolish.
0,These soldiers are working with Vallen to save the girl.”
0,“And you expect me to believe that?” Kep laughed.
0,"“If you will not pay me, perhaps the Lord of Sen’uon would pay well for news of your plan to steal the girl away from him to claim the bounty.”"
0,Kep spun around Inym’s head.
0,"Inym grabbed her knife and tried to cut Kep down, but she had no hope of striking a wind pixie."
0,“Sorry.
0,"I mean your rescue operation,” Kep jeered, and then she was gone."
0,"“Ancestors curse that pixie,” Inym spat."
1,She jumped to her feet and ran through the camp for Basara.
0,"The camp was rousing, and Inym thought at first that they had heard the exchange, but their spriggan scout was calling from up the ravine."
0,Someone was approaching from down the road.
0,"“Byurk,” the scout called."
0,“Byurk has returned without Thanysa.”
0,Basara ran out to meet Byurk who almost collapsed in her arms.
0,"He was without his cloak, his face was ashen, and his lips were purple."
0,Basara grabbed him and carried him to camp.
0,The minum winced in pain as the maenad heated him slowly.
0,She removed his empty sack of provisions and frosted water skin.
0,"“Where is your cloak,” she asked."
0,"“With Thanysa,” Byurk replied with quivering lips."
0,Basara noticed that Byurk’s arm was heavily swollen and called over the eldest dryad.
0,"“What happened to Thanysa,” the other nymph woman demanded in anger, but Basara motioned her to calm down."
0,"“She is wrapped in my cloak and entombed by her request, hibernating,” Byurk replied."
0,“She is gravely injured.
0,We were attacked by Lurr as we entered the pass.
0,They are killing any who come seeking the widow.
0,We must hurry.
0,I do not think Thanysa will last.”
0,"“If Thanysa is hibernating, she will survive,” Basara assured."
0,“That is not what I fear.
0,"We escaped their attack, so they will be searching."
0,"I hid her west of the pass, but they can still find her.”"
0,"“I also have a warning,” Inym spoke up."
0,“A pixie I hired to monitor Zose’s party has learned of the girl’s identity and came to me secretly this evening asking to share in the bounty.
0,"When I refused and explained our goal to rescue her, she left to claim the bounty herself."
0,She is headed back to Sen’uon to warn Ni’inca Ab’pul of our arrival.”
0,"“What else are you not telling us,” Basara demanded."
0,"“I know very little,” Inym replied quickly."
0,“She told me Dyson is dead and Zose has gone missing.
0,Jeddin has likely sided with his brother Deinan and the Lurr of Sen’uon.”
0,The air of the camp warmed.
0,Byurk pulled himself away from the dryad’s treatment of his arm.
0,He grasped Basara’s painfully hot hand.
0,"“Breathe,” he spoke slowly, looking into the flame of her eyes."
0,“Breathe.
0,I am sure Zose is safe.”
0," “Thank you, old friend,” Basara replied."
0,“I am better at controlling my emotions than when you last knew me.
0,I am fine.”
0,"Although Basara gave her word, the air of the camp did not cool."
0,Inym began questioning her safety traveling with this group.
0,"Basara was an active volcano threatening to erupt, and each piece of bitter news brought her ever closer."
0,* * *
1,"Phasing through stone was an exhausting task, like moving through water without buoyancy."
0,Even remaining stationary was exhausting.
0,"Female oread traits were stronger than male, so they could move almost effortlessly, but for Zose, he could not endure the strain for longer than a few hours at a time."
0,"Add that most the stone was freezing cold, he had to fight hypothermia all the while or take time to rest within the walls of a heated home to recuperate, further decreasing the time he had to search Sen’uon for word of Ceil."
0,At least the city of stone enabled him to move almost anywhere.
0,"Timber was scarce along the Hemenonan range, so little was used for construction, only for accent or furnishings for those wealthy enough to afford it."
0,"No homes had paneling along the walls, ceiling, or floor like many affluent homes constructed from the ruins or stone further south."
0,This enabled Zose to peer into every room of every home as if the very wall surface was his eyes.
0,Any sound that traveled through the walls became his ears.
0,"The stone itself was his senses, but after days of searching, he could not locate Ceil."
0,"As Zose traveled back up through the mountain to a high and nearly inaccessible shelf near the summit, he feared that she had already been taken from the city or was killed."
0,"He found bloody soil and tiny bits of flesh at their planned meeting location, but because there were no remains, he could not determine for certain the owner of that flesh."
0,"The only hints he found were a large number of footsteps leading back towards Sen’uon with none leading down the road and a blackened, putrid corpse of melted flesh that was too large to be either Dyson or Ceil."
0,Zose rekindled his extinguished fire with the last remaining coals from the provisions he received in Hen’anin.
0,"A few flint sparks and they sizzled to life, roaring with flame."
0,He did not fear his fire being spotted from below.
0,He was high and the shelf wide on the far face of the peak from Sen’uon.
0,"Only mountains spread before him, and in the distance, the faint amber glow of the Afarit on the horizon."
0,"Despite the chill and his numbed fingers, he was sweating."
0,The mountain peak was riddled with iron.
0,"Metals were difficult even for female oreads to pass through, and refined metals were impassible even for them."
0,"He was thoroughly exhausted from his days of searching through stone, and after sleeping for the night, he had a difficult decision."
0,He was out of supplies.
0,He no longer had food or coals for a fire.
0,"This left him three options: steal supplies that he could not take into the stone with him and threaten getting caught trying to escape the city, leave the city for an unknown number of days to procure more supplies, or give up on Ceil altogether."
0,"Due to the difficulty of the search, Zose had only covered about half of the city, and even then, conversations and hints could appear in locations he already searched."
0,The city was a maze of ruins both above and below ground.
0,"He was an earth elemental, not an earth mage, so he could not use the stone to detect the presence of those in the structures."
0,"Even if he did find Ceil, he could not take her into the stone with him."
0,His pride was on the line for letting a charge under his protection be captured.
0,"More than this, Ceil was vital to ending the conflict that ate at Basara."
0,"For both of them, he needed to find Ceil."
0,One more day.
0,He would search one more day before making the final decision of whether to abandon Ceil.
0,"When Zose woke the next morning, he searched the ashes of his fire for any pieces of coal that might not have burned completely."
0,"His cloak was frosted over, showing the fire had not lasted the night on the few coals he had left to give it."
0,"Sure enough, nothing remained in the ash."
0,Zose mentally prepared himself for the cold and removed his cloak before diving into the stone beneath him.
0,"He had his clothes woven from his own hair and his weak leather created from his mother’s skin, but in the stone, they provided no protection from the chill."
0,"His body held no true shape in stone, so external coverings could not protect against the elements."
0,He only had them should he need to exit the stone at any time.
0,"After the long descent through the mountain, Zose exited the stone into an empty pocket of air to rest."
0,"He had used it to recover the exhaustion of meandering through the iron veins of the mountain after each descent, and now the stale air the pocket once held was becoming almost too thin to breathe."
0,"There were a handful of caverns snaking through and around the city, but the Lurr used them, leaving this isolated pocket as the sole place he could rest comfortably without exiting into the cold or where a Lurr might smell him."
0,This truly was his last day of searching.
0,"The limit to his rest was the lack of air in the pocket, so although he wanted to rest longer, he had little choice but to leave."
0,Zose left the pocket for the ruinous caverns under the city.
1,"The market was below ground in the center of the city, and it was the only location he checked without fail each day."
0,"Lurr were often lazy in the cold, so the market was not packed in the morning like in Ib’nua, but as the traders prepared their wares they often talked and gossiped."
0,There was also a chance that the meat of an elf girl might arrive for sale at any time.
0,He could not risk ignoring that possibility.
0,"Those unaccustomed to the wilderlands and especially Lurr cultures might dread seeing a naked corpse hung by a hook on a meat rack, but for the Lurr, it was food like any other, and the only type of fresh meat that was truly safe for them to eat."
0,Civilized Lurr did not murder to stock their racks.
0,The bodies tended to be of those who could not endure the harsh life of the wilderlands and perished by other means or criminals who were captured and executed by Sen’uon.
0,Such meat was a delicacy and quite expensive due to its rarity.
0,"Had Zose been killed trying to force his way through the pass when denied entry to Sen’uon, that would have been his fate."
0,"The butcher, an odd character of stout body and long limbs like a dwarf with the arms and legs of an elf, dragged two sacks to his hooks and removed the contents."
0,Zose breathed a mental sigh of relief.
0,"Ceil was not among them, just a lycon and a troll."
0,“Where’d you find a lycon?” Another merchant curious of the new meat walked over to the butcher.
0,"“I don’t expect him to sell well,” the butcher replied, not answering about the source of the body."
0,“Too many are afraid that there might be some wolf in the meat.”
0,There were certainly very few civilized Lurr who were mutations of beastkin due to the fear that bestial instincts might make them lose themselves.
0,“The troll should sell fast.
0,They’re strong.
0,Found her frozen.
0,Even hibernation has its limits it seems.”
0,“Perhaps it will not sell as fast as you think.
0,Many already got their fill of troll a few days ago.”
0,"Zose was about the leave the conversation, but that comment rooted him in place."
0,“I heard from Deinan.
0,A scrawny male.
0,Even troll women are stronger.
0,She should still sell.”
0,“I’ll buy her if you decrease the price.”
0,The butcher glared.
0,"“If she does not sell today, I will drop the price.”"
0,The merchant laughed and walked away.
1,Zose sped away.
0,Finally a clue.
0,Of course Deinan would be connected.
0,Zose never even consider that Deinan was not out completing numerous contracts.
0,He always was.
0,"Jeddin’s father was a Lurr, unknown to his mother."
0,"The man was advanced enough in his evolution into a spriggan that it was impossible to tell without life magic, at least until the second pregnancy which resulted in Lurr spawn."
0,"Jeddin’s mother ran the man off, feeling betrayed that he would keep such an important secret."
0,"Her father, not wanting his daughter to feel the emptiness of lacking a proper child after her pregnancy, created a doppelganger of himself with one of the larva she birthed."
0,"She raised the Lurr as a spriggan, but when the village grew suspicious of her new son, especially his rate of growth and strength, she left the Amelian Empire with her two sons and settled in the wilderlands where Lurr were more accepted."
0,"Zose knew Deinan lived in Sen’uon, but he did not know where."
0,If that was indeed the case--that Deinan knew of the attack--then Jeddin might still be alive and could explain what happened.
0,"Deinan was a hunter mercenary, which meant he was wealthier than most given the advantages of Lurr strength enabling the completion of far more difficult contracts."
0,Wealthier Lurr lived underground in the northwest sector of the city where the ruins were grander.
0,Zose had not yet searched there out of fear of a guard with an earth affinity watching for thieves seeking to enter the affluent ruins.
0,"An earth mage would likely not be expecting infiltration from within the stone, but they might still detect something odd about the stone if looking specifically for it."
0,"Zose had no physical body when in stone, but the nature of the stone changed as he phased through it, so he still needed to take caution."
0,"In the northwest sector, Zose searched beginning from the lowest-class ruins."
0,Deinan was not a lord or nabob or from a notable lineage.
0,He could simply afford the better accommodations.
0,"With this in mind, the search was surprisingly quick, taking only a couple hours."
0,"Zose did not find Deinan but someone he wanted to speak with even more, Jeddin."
1,Jeddin resided in a two-room ruin near the surface.
0,"The rooms were mismatched and not level, as if one had toppled onto the other but kept most of its form before being buried underground."
0,"It was not lavishly furnished, but Deinan spent most his time away on long contracts, so such furnishings and other embellishments were not needed."
0,Zose traversed the walls of the ruin to the sloped and uneven floor of the upper room.
0,He moved to the corner behind where Jeddin sat lazily on a stuffed fur.
0,"“Jeddin,” Zose whispered."
0,Jeddin twitched but remained in his position.
0,"“Took you long enough to find me,” he spoke back quietly without bringing attention to Zose."
0,"It seemed that Jeddin might not be safe here if he had to keep Zose’s appearance secret, or perhaps he was simply protecting Zose."
0,"“Where is Gein,” Zose asked, jumping right to topic."
0,"“Why did you not tell us the truth of who you were escorting,” Jeddin replied with silent vitriol seeping through his voice."
0,"“Dyson is dead, and I would be too if Deinan had not protected me.”"
0,Somehow the truth of Ceil’s identity became known to the citizens of Sen’uon before their arrival.
0,That was the only explanation for why they were attacked at their planned meeting place.
0,It would not be difficult to track Jeddin or Dyson there and wait for Ceil to land.
0,"“My job was the protection of my escort, and that protection required secrecy of her identity."
0,"If you truly know who she is, you should understand.”"
0,Jeddin exhaled through his nose.
0,“I am beginning to think that you are the one who does not know the truth of that woman.
0,I am not speaking of her identity as the widow of the Amelian Emperor that Tolmyur seeks.
0,"Dyson was ignorant of this, but I knew from the day we set out from Ib’nua.”"
0,Zose gathered the part of him that was his blades within the stone.
0,"If Jeddin was a threat to Ceil, his hand would be forced."
0,“Lurr have abilities that we still do not understand.
0,Their eyes are better than ours in many ways.
0,They saw an evil omen darker than the night fly over their city.
0,"The darkness of that woman is such that the Lurr could not find words to explain her, resorting to mad rambling as they trembled in terror at the sight of her."
0,You saw how the Lurr reacted in Hen’anin.”
0,"“Where is she,” Zose demanded."
0,“The first Lurr who tried to carry her away unconscious melted the moment he drew close.
0,"The Lurr saw what happened, but I could not."
0,"I was made to drag her by rope in his place, and I thought I would meet the same fate, but whatever evil that struck him did not affect me."
0,Lord Ab’pul has her now.
0,I do not doubt she is dead.
0,"I was to be executed as a criminal for bringing that girl to Sen’uon, but Deinan defended me."
0,"I accepted a Lurr as my brother, so Lord Ab’pul gave me pass."
0,I am now here under Deinan’s watch for some unknown duration.”
0,“Where does the Lord of Sen’uon live?”
0,“I do not know.
0,Not in the city.
0,West.
0,I was led blind.
0,"I admit that I only joined your party to make certain something was done so that no one else would die mistaken for her, but things have changed now."
0,"Give up on her, Zose."
0,"Whatever she is, for the sake of your wife and family, you should end your involvement here.”"
0,"“Thank you for your concern, friend.” Zose said before heading up towards the surface."
0,He barely heard Jeddin’s final reply muffled through the stone.
0,“There are no friends between hunter mercenaries.”
0,"Zose expected the Lord of Sen’uon to have the largest and most lavish dwelling, perhaps a massive ruin still mostly intact or a large cave system snaking through multiple ruins."
0,"He did not have the energy for an exhaustive search, and he did not doubt it would take many days to locate Ceil."
0,"He had neither the time nor the resources, and should he find her, he did not have the ability to free her on his own."
0,"As he was, he was powerless."
0,Zose returned to his camp high up on the mountain shelf.
0,He rummaged through his supplies and grabbed the small brass whistle.
0,Chapter 13
0,“Bartering with Lives”
1,Inym sat pensive in the camp as some of the party followed Byurk to where he had entombed the troll.
0,"They camped far west of the road, further south of the supposed tomb and the steep Hemenonan range to reduce the risk of their party being spotted."
0,Inym did not know whether the Lurr would be searching for the party or if Kep did warn Sen’uon about their approach.
0,"At the same time, she felt she could no longer remain with the group."
0,"She was the cause of the incident in Sen’uon, and should Basara learn of it, her life was forfeit."
0,She was not simply balancing on the edge of a blade.
0,The blade itself was volatile as Basara’s emotional state became more and more suspect.
0,She could not turn back or flee because she no longer had supplies of her own to survive traveling back through the plains.
0,"If she had any hope of survival, it was in undoing what she had done."
0,"“I am going to scout the pass,” she told the sickly anthousai girl curled up by the fire, or perhaps she could no longer be called and anthousai after the harsh winds of the final stretch of road unprotected by any rocks or ravines rid her mossy hair of most her white blossoms."
0,"“Then I will join you,” the girl replied."
0,"“No, I am just checking if they have increased the guard to see if that pixie has actually given her warning and it was trusted."
0,"I was a hunter mercenary, so I should be able to enter the pass without suspicion, possibly gaining access to the city."
0,"You are one of the scouts of this party, so you are needed here for your watch.”"
0,"“Me being a scout is why I should help,” the girl protested further."
0,Her eyes showed a pain beyond her illness.
0,She had her own reasons to investigate.
0,"“Let Lemi follow,” one of the elven soldiers ordered, having overheard the exchange."
0,“I can take her watch when the time comes.”
0,Inym sniffed in annoyance.
0,"“Fine, but stay back, and should something happen to me, retreat back to camp.”"
1,Lemi grabbed her bow and jumped to her feet.
0,She followed Inym through the maze of ruins to the road and then remained back as Inym traveled up towards the narrow pass.
0,"When Inym looked back, she could not spot the girl."
0,"Dryads were renowned for their stealth, so she had no way of knowing how close or far Lemi followed."
0,She had nothing to hide from Lemi.
0,She only cared for the young dryad’s safety.
0,"Immediately when entering the pass, Inym heard motion among the rocks high above her."
0,She could not tell the number or location.
0,"The sound echoed, muffled by the wind."
0,The number of hidden guards did not seem any greater than the last time she had visited Sen’uon many years ago.
0,"At the narrowest section of the pass, like a massive knife cut down a sheer rock face, the same five guards from her memory stood watch."
0,A massive troll Lurr approached alone and stood before Inym on the pass.
0,“What business brings you to Sen’uon?”
0,“I am a retired hunter mercenary traveling north.
0,"I request entrance into the city for my own safety,” Inym replied in Elven."
0,"When speaking with a Lurr, truth must always be used or the Lurr would catch the lie."
0,"Hunter mercenaries practiced hiding lies within truth when speaking to Lurr, but the Lurr were also aware of such tactics."
0,“Recent circumstances prohibit me from permitting entry into Sen’uon without explicit reason.”
0,“My supplies have run out.
0,"Should you force me to return through the plains, I will surely perish.”"
0,"The Lurr’s lips rose to his nose in consternation, and then he glared down at Inym with his red eyes."
0,Inym shrunk back by reflex.
0,“You fear us.”
0,“My mind is still plagued by a severe injury caused by a chimera only a few years ago.” She parted her two cloaks and lifted her armor to reveal the horrid scar across her stomach and abdomen.
0,“I cannot help but cower at times.
0,It is beyond my control when in front of a Lurr.
0,I promise you I am no threat to civilized Lurr.”
0,The guard nodded in understanding.
0,“You say your life is in danger?
0,Are you aware that you are being followed?”
0,Inym couldn’t respond.
0,"This was one risk she foresaw when accepting Lemi’s aid, but after the Vallen soldier ordered Lemi to follow, she could not turn down Lemi’s company without fear of their party growing suspicious of her and preventing her departure."
0,"She had hoped a dryad’s stealth would remain unnoticed, but it seemed a Lurr’s senses were far too keen."
0,The guard raised his hand after enduring Inym’s silence long enough to ensure his answer.
0,Silence in front of a Lurr who could hear all lies was the same as affirmation.
0,Inym heard Lemi’s scream but did not turn around.
0,"Much to her relief, the scream was not silenced immediately but drew closer as Lemi was carried before the guard."
0,"“A few days ago, we met a strange pairing of a Tolmyur commander and Vallen soldier."
0,Now we find a Melian.
0,"Girl, what connection do you have to this woman?”"
0,Lemi remained silent.
0,The guard reached down and grabbed her moss-like hair with a hand as big as her head.
0,"He forced the girl to look into his red eyes, but she did not fright."
0,"The girl was willing to die rather than endanger Inym, but Inym could not let that happen."
0,"“Spare her, I beg you."
0,"She is no comrade of mine, but it was only through her company that I was able to reach Sen’uon.”"
0,The guard released Lemi.
0,She fell to her knees and quickly bowed herself to the ground.
0,"“What business does she have in Sen’uon,” the guard asked Inym, and again she could not answer, but given the threat to Lemi’s life, Inym could not remain silent either."
0,"“Please, she is a child."
0,Let her go.”
0,The guard heard all he needed.
0,"He knelt down and grasped Inym by the front of her cloak, pulling her face close."
0,"“What is your name,” he asked with glowing red eyes."
0,Inym’s fear muted her tongue.
0,She knew now that Kep had warned the city of her arrival.
0,"Whether she remained silent or told her name, she would be killed."
0,"Her mind raced to find another name by which she was called at any time in the past, to give an old truth that might spare her life, but try as she might, she had none."
0,"Unlike many who changed their name after fleeing to the wilderlands, she kept her birth name."
0,"She was not a criminal, nor had she fled to the wilderlands for her life."
0,She only left the Amelian Empire in her youth because she could not tolerate its oppression of the trolls any longer.
0,"“What is your name!” The guard’s eyes flared red, squeezing fearful tears from the corners of Inym’s eyes."
0,"“Her name is Inym,” Lemi replied for her."
0,"Inym wanted to curse the girl, but she knew Lemi spoke out of fear of the guard’s growing impatience and to protect Inym’s life."
0,Lemi did not know that Inym’s name would end her life just the same as silence.
0,"The guard released Inym, and she immediately bowed to the ground."
0,Numerous Lurr circled them.
0,They could not escape.
0,"“Inym, Lord Ni’inca Ab’pul of Sen’uon would like to express his utmost gratitude in your forewarning of the approach of Lady Ceil of the Amelian Empire."
0,"He has ordered that should you arrive in Sen’uon, you are to be brought before him."
0,You have no right to refuse.”
0,"“What happened to Ceil,” Lemi almost screamed."
0,“Do you have her?”
0,"“Quiet,” Inym rebuked before bowing again to the guard."
0,“This dryad is a friend of Lady Ceil and is only here out of concern for her safety.
0,She is a child and can be no threat to your city.
0,Please spare her.”
0,"“She will join you,” the guard ordered."
0,Forceful hands lifted Inym and Lemi to their feet from behind and pushed them forward into the narrow pass.
1,"The moment the first ruins of the city of Sen’uon came into view, a blindfold was placed over their eyes."
0,"Inym held confidence in her sense of direction, but the path she was led felt unnatural."
0,"They left the city and traveled west, but the moment she descended underground, walking forwards felt like backstepping."
0,She felt as if she would fall backwards when descending and forwards when ascending.
0,"Each left turn felt like a complete revolution ending the same direction she had originally faced, and each right turn hardly felt like a turn at all."
0,It was as if this very cavern or land or ruin was charmed to prevent any understanding of its structure.
0,"After a final long corridor where she felt as if she would fall into the sky, all at once normalcy returned to her senses."
0,"The following corridors were heated, and Inym began to sweat under her heavy cloaks."
0,"They turned left and ascended a curved stairway, their steps echoing in the large room."
0,A draft caressed her face from what she assumed was a thinner corridor before her.
0,There they stood and waited as their former escorts were exchanged for others.
0,She was then led into the corridor.
0,"This long, narrow corridor had no deviations."
0,It was perfectly straight and even.
0,"The deeper she was led, the more she felt that the corridor had a pulse that grew louder and louder until it sounded no different than a massive heart beating."
0,"The air warmed yet again, and the pulse echoed."
0,She now stood in a massive hall.
1,"Her blindfold was removed, and she immediately screamed."
0,"Terror, seeped in her past trauma, consumed Inym."
0,Visions flooded her mind of a moist cave filled with Lurr larva covering the walls so thick they pulsated like raw flesh.
0,Numerous red eyes appeared like phantoms.
0,"She could hear the death rows of the rest of her party as the memory of her past self fled through the cave grasping the hand of the youngest member of her party not yet old enough to be called a man only to encounter a monstrous and mutated form, an unknown addition to the target of her ill-fated contract, a second chimera."
0,"The first chimera was small but toxic, both poisonous and venomous."
0,Her party was ill-equipped to fight it.
0,They had no life mage.
0,"The second was larger than her with dozens of arms sprouting from its hunched back, each with its own set of eyes."
0,"She could only act as a distraction for the final member of her party to escape, Pyn’s younger brother."
0,"She collapsed the cave behind him so the surviving brood could not make chase after the boy, sealing her inside."
0,There in her dark prison with her ven exhausted she fought for survival against two chimeras and their brood with only the red of Lurr eyes for visibility.
0,She fought for three days.
0,"By the time she finished the last chimera, she was poisoned with her abdomen gored out, but the toxins prevented her hibernation until physical exhaustion broke her and she collapsed drowning in the terror of not knowing what would become of her."
0,She awoke in Pyn’s care.
0,He personally led a party of civilized Lurr to rescue her once he received word of the disaster from his brother.
0,"She barely survived, and the extent of the damage and poison prevented full recovery, leaving her with a weakened body and physical scars just as severe as her emotional ones."
0,And now before Inym stood a chimera larger and more terrifying than the monsters of her past.
0,"She tried to flee with all her might, but the grip of her escorts was iron."
0,"She screamed and screamed, but when she could not free herself, she broke down into incoherent wailing sobs."
1,"“Peace, Inym."
0,"Do not fear,” the monster spoke through its undulating neck."
0,“I did not summon you here to harm you but to beg a favor of you for which you will be greatly rewarded.”
0,The terrifying monstrosity’s neck extended and his head lowered to the floor of the hall in supplication.
0,“I have none other to ask but you.
0,"There are only four who are not Lurr in all of Sen’uon: Lady Ceil, Jeddin, you, and the Melian at your side."
0,"Jeddin has refused me, wishing death before lending his aid."
0,I am in need of a caretaker for Lady Ceil.
0,"She is weakening, and the evil within her is growing ever stronger because of it."
0,She refuses to eat or sleep.
0,"I have forced food upon her, but the numerous Lurr I have sent die without fail while feeding her.”"
0,"“You wish death upon me!” Inym tried to escape again, but the grip on her remained fast."
0,“She is only a direct threat to us Lurr.
0,"We are incompatible, opposites, and so we die if we draw close enough to touch."
0,But for you she should be no more than a starved woman too weak to lift a hand against you.
0,"For now, she is only an immediate danger to Lurr, but should she die, even you will not escape the evil freed from its cage of flesh.”"
0,A Lurr walked in from a side corridor and set a pedestal before Inym.
0,A second Lurr followed and placed a velvet satchel atop the pedestal.
0,"She loosed the bands and displayed to Inym glimmering gemstones in a myriad of colors, each individual gem undoubtedly worth the entire satchel’s weight in precious metals."
0,"“If that payment is insufficient, I will offer more."
0,Wealth means little when all are dead.
0,I will also reward the Melian in any manner she desires as I know precious stones mean nothing to her kind.
0,Who is she?”
0,Inym was too terrified to reply.
0,She turned her head away as if not seeing the wretched form would somehow make it disappear.
0,"Receiving no answer, the chimera instead spoke with Lemi in a language Inym could not recognize."
0,Lemi grew excited and agreed immediately to whatever deal was struck between them.
0,"“Inym, you and Lemi will care for Lady Ceil."
0,"My children will make all arrangements and provide whatever you request.” Without another word, the chimera vanished near-instantly down the left corridor."
0,The female Lurr fastened the ties of the satchel and handed it to Inym.
0,"With or without her consent, she was now forced into her role."
0,"“Follow me,” the Lurr ordered."
0,"Lemi moved without question, and Inym reluctantly followed."
1,Their guide led them to the back of the hall and passed what at one time might have been grand stone doors but were now eroded and crumbling.
0,"“I can go no further than here,” their guide informed them."
0,“You will find Lady Ceil at the end of the corridor.”
0,"Lemi picked up pace into a jog, and Inym followed not to lose her."
0,The corridor was short and ended in a large and wide chamber of tiered seating.
0,"The air was sickly, and each breath felt toxic but not with poison."
0,The air was dead.
0,Inym felt as if her very life was being drained away by standing in the room.
0,"Adorned chairs circled each tier, and at the center in the back stood an elevated platform."
0,“Ceil!” Lemi ran for the center platform.
0,"Inym backed away, wanting to flee down the corridor."
0,Bones piled at the base of the platform buried partially in black soot.
0,"As the pile rose to meet the platform, the corpses became fresher as if melted into dark bile, their bones protruding from the sickly black mucus."
0,"Ceil sat there on the platform, a Queen of Death atop a throne of corpses."
0,"Her eyes were open, but there was no life in them."
0,She never heard her former comrade cry her name nor did she notice the young dryad scramble over the many bones and trudge through the filth to reach her.
0,"Inym watched in anticipation, waiting for the moment that Lemi would melt like the rest, but when Lemi placed her hand on Ceil’s cheek, no harm befell her."
0,"Seeing this, Inym walked forward slowly down the central steps of the tiered council room."
0,"“She’s alive,” Ceil called back."
0,"The closer Inym approached, the worse the smell grew and the thicker the death in the air became."
0,Breathing grew exhausting.
0,She could see Lemi’s moss hair wilt as the girl struggled to pull Ceil off the podium.
0,“Help me!”
0,Inym rushed down to the podium and held back her sick as she trudged through the putrid sludge up to her knees.
0,They grabbed Ceil and carried her up the steps to the entrance before laying her on the ground.
0,“Remove her armor.
0,I don’t know how.
0,She has been sitting in her own filth.
0,She is covered in rashes and her skin beneath her armor is diseased.
0,"I will ask for a place we can wash her so I can treat her.” After giving her order, Lemi ran back down the corridor to where their guide waited."
0,Inym barely had time to remove the jack before Lemi returned and informed her that the Lurr would prepare a bath.
0,"Inym was going to leave the filthy jack behind, but Lemi grabbed it and set it atop Ceil as they carried her."
0,Their guide kept a full five yards distant from them as she led them back through the large hall and down the right corridor.
0,The maze of ruins returned as if the structure was built from multiple ruins piled atop each other.
0,"Some rooms were upside-down at odd angles as if toppled over the others, and the steps were often at slants that made footing difficult."
0,They were led to more of a cave than a ruin.
0,The humidity was thick.
0,Natural hot springs bubbled in the back.
0,Inym and Lemi were ordered to remain near the side wall of the cave as a tub was fashioned from earth magic and filled with water magic.
0,"“You may use water from the spring to heat the bath, but take caution."
0,"It will scald her if used directly,” the Lurr explained."
0,Inym helped bathe Ceil.
0,She then washed Ceil’s clothes and armor while Lemi treated Ceil’s illness and internal injuries that had not completely healed or healed incorrectly.
0,Inym quickly understood why Lemi did not leave the jack behind.
0,It was plated with resfahil.
0,This was regal armor of the Amelian Emperor’s widow.
0,"She took extra care to clean the fabric and leather, using water that would terribly scald her if not for her fire affinity."
0,"The dye washed out from the minerals of the spring, leaving the fabric a dull grey that barely kept a hint of purple."
0,“Watch Ceil.
0,"I will ask for a bed and some food,” Lemi announced."
0,“Stop.
0,"I will do it,” Inym said as she carried the dripping armor back and set it beside Ceil."
0,“Aren’t you scared of Lurr?
0,I can talk to them for you.
0,I won’t be in danger.
0,Lurr don’t bother with dryads.
0,"We are like plants, so we are no use to them.”"
0,"“No, I mean…” Inym did not know how to explain, because she did not want the girl to fear her friend."
0,“You cannot see yourself.
0,You are wilting.
0,"You should rest a while, away from Ceil."
0,I will speak with the Lurr for you.”
0,Lemi’s eyes widened.
0,"“Oh, no."
0,"I… There are no plants here, so… To be honest, I am under a lot of stress."
0,I have not felt well since we started crossing the plains.
0,"I was fine crossing the Nuanae range, but after that, the trees, they just disappeared."
0,I’m fine.”
0,Inym wanted to tell her that was not the case.
0,She saw the visible wilting as Lemi stood amid the death in the council room.
0,Ceil was a danger to Lemi.
0,"Even that chimera might not have expected this when he asked for Lemi’s aid, or perhaps he did not care and only needed someone to immediately help Ceil before she succumbed to starvation and illness."
0,"At least away from that room, death no longer saturated the air."
0,“I will ask for them to bring any plants they can and place them in the room they will prepare for Ceil.
0,And clean water.”
0,Lemi flashed a wide but wilted smile.
0,“Thanks!”
0,Inym once again found their guide waiting not too distant outside the hot spring cave.
0,"Room accommodation was already underway, and the guide agreed to do something about plants and water for Lemi."
0,She showed Inym the location and where any supplies they requested would be brought.
0,It would then be her task to bring the supplies to the room once Ceil was inside.
0,"After seeing the pile of Lurr bones in the council room, Inym understood why the Lurr did not want to be anywhere near Ceil."
0,The room was large and built from three ruins that had crumbled together.
0,The walls that had separated the rooms were carved away leaving only the outer walls and floor of each room.
0,"The floor was leveled, but each separate room sat on its own elevated shelf connected by slanted stairs."
0,"The Lurr prepared a wide bed of stuffed firs on the highest shelf, enough for the three of them to rest comfortably."
0,"Inym was apprehensive about sleeping in the same bed as the Queen of Death, but she could simply take her allotment of furs and move them to the second shelf."
0,There were no plants in the room yet.
0,"Those would have to be gathered from outside, and even then, they would likely be without leaves due to the winter weather, so Lemi would need to nurture them to make them bloom out of season."
0,"When Inym returned, she found Lemi beside the hot spring with Ceil’s head resting in her lap."
0,"“She’s finally sleeping,” Lemi said as she caressed Ceil’s cheek with a shaking hand."
0,"“She spoke, too."
0,She whispered Sammy’s name.” The girl forced a mournful smile and placed Ceil’s cheek against her abdomen.
0,“Don’t worry.
0,Sammy is still right here with us.”
0,"“You are pregnant,” Inym realized."
0,Lemi nodded.
0,“It was a secret between Sammy and me.
0,Sammy let me name my daughter after her just before she died.
0,"Sammy… she was Ceil’s closest friend, and she’s not lost."
0,"My daughter has taken her place.” Lemi leaned down and rested her forehead against Ceil’s, bending in a manner that only a wilting plant could."
0,"“I’m sorry I never told you,” she whispered to Ceil."
0,“The room is ready for us.
0,You should take care of yourself before you take care of Ceil.
0,I can watch over her for the time being.”
0,“Let me stay like this for a bit longer.
0,"I do not want to wake her,” Lemi said with a warm smile."
0,* * *
1,"When Justin knelt on the ground away from camp, everyone collectively understood that they should not bother him with anything trivial."
0,He spent whatever small amount of free time they had during camp meditating.
0,"The purpose of their camps were to rest and eat in preparation for more travel, so free time was always short unless someone wanted to sacrifice sleep, but for Justin that free time was much longer, not because he was never given any tasks when setting up or taking down camp--he did his fair part--but because he slowed time to a crawl during his meditation."
0,What started as extending his hour or less of meditation into two or three hours soon became a week within his own mind every time they set up camp.
0,His many days traveling north through the wilderlands became months spent in meditation.
0,"Meditating in the snow felt nostalgic, recalling the memory of the day his ignorance hurt Eydis and so Sammy took the mantle of that anger and punched him."
0,"That was the day he learned he could manipulate time, but it was months later before he could control it even a little."
0,"He used his time magic to take a bullet for Sammy when Jethro invaded Gullivan, but when that bullet became a spear in Revlan, he was powerless."
0,"He could slow time for himself to increase his reaction speed, but that did not change the fact that he could not move any faster than his physical capabilities allowed."
0,He noticed the spear too late.
0,"He slowed time immediately to heighten his reaction to try and grasp it, but he was too far away and too slow."
0,"By the time he grasped the spear’s haft, it was already through Sammy’s chest, and she was gone."
0,Justin had mourned before.
0,He remembered vividly the passing of his high school girlfriend due to complications during pregnancy caused by his ven poisoning her.
0,Neither his parents nor hers seemed to notice or care about how much he was suffering.
0,They only pointed fingers and shouted blame at him for not only the loss of one life but two.
0,"Failed relationship after failed relationship later, he met Sammy."
0,She was so vibrant and overflowing with love for him that the pains of his past started melting away.
0,"He regretted hiding the truth from her and the unseen anguish that caused her, but he feared the loss of that beacon of light."
0,He was not completely honest when he revealed his past to Sammy in Revlan.
0,He was not saving up for a ring.
0,"He already bought it and hid it away in his desk in his room, but in his anxiety and fear he still struggled to tell Sammy the truth."
0,His delay is what led to them breaking up when Sammy only wanted answers.
0,"Sammy meant so much to him, more than his past girlfriends, more than Eydis, more than anyone."
0,She was the one he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.
0,"Justin’s meditation was not only to improve his proficiency with time magic but also to give him time to mourn, to sort out his feelings and regrets, to heal…"
0,And to make certain nothing like that happened ever again.
0,Justin was unsure how much time passed during his meditation.
0,"Unlike the previous camps, the party had already reached their destination and was only waiting until a plan could be devised to enter Sen’uon and investigate for clues about Ceil."
0,"This led to full freedom to meditate as long as he wanted, but being enshrouded in one’s own thoughts and only those thoughts for extended periods of time was draining and eventually led to numbness."
0,"Justin estimated maybe a month or perhaps two had passed in his mind during his current meditation, and for the sake of his own sanity he opened his eyes."
1,"A bizarre creature stood frozen before him, leaning over and reaching for his chest."
0,"It was like a werewolf, bearing a distinctly canine face, though without fur, and ears but with a mostly anthropomorphic body."
0,It wore tight leather armor and was armed with a saber on its hip.
0,"Had Justin stayed in meditation a day or two longer, the creature might have grasped him."
0,"Justin slowly resumed time as he shifted his body out of the way of the beast’s grasp, but its reflexes were keen."
0,"As he moved, the hand moved with him."
0,Justin changed tactics.
0,"Time froze again, but only for the creature."
0,Justin stood and ran for the main camp.
0,“Intruders in the camp!” Justin shouted.
0,"Outside, more of the same creatures stood guard atop other ruins."
0,He ran into the tilted archway of the neighboring structure and turned left down the short hallway to the center of the ruin where their main camp was set.
0,Chloe grabbed Justin as he entered the large circular room and pulled him to the side next to Benab.
0,"Their entire party stood on one side of the room, and no less than thirty of those same beasts stood on the other."
0,"Only the Tolmyur soldiers brandished their weapons, but Byurk was keeping them back."
0,"Basara stood at the front before the gathering of wolf-people, conversing with them."
0,"One approached and embraced her, sniffing her neck."
0,Benab whispered something to Chloe who then translated for Justin.
0,“Basara introduced herself as Zose’s wife.
0,They are comparing her scent.
0,Apparently Zose is an ally of these lycon.”
0,"After some deliberation, the lycon who had checked Basara’s scent stood before her once more."
0,Something he said made Basara raise her hand to her mouth.
0,"The gathering of lycon parted, and those who guarded the far entrance to the room left down the hall."
1,A few minutes later they returned escorting a man and a large bird.
0,“Coby!”
0,Chloe weaved through the tense onlookers towards the familiar large blue hawk.
0,Coby trilled happily as he trotted towards Chloe.
0,The man limped forward just behind Coby.
0,"The second he was within arm’s reach of Basara, she embraced him."
0,Justin rushed forward to Chloe and Coby.
0,“This is the man who was escorting Ceil?
0,Where is she?”
0,"The gathering of elfkind, humans, nymphs and lycon sat around the now roaring fire."
0,Basara introduced her party and their purpose in following after Zose.
0,"Zose then explained the situation and how he used the lycons’ debt to him to enlist their aid; however, the lycon were not committed to the payment he asked of them."
0,"“You rescued one of our kin, but we cannot risk the elimination of our pack to save one of yours,” the speaker for the lycon replied."
0,“I understand that.
0,"I am not asking for you to lay down your lives for Ceil,” Zose replied."
0,"“The risk is far greater than you realize, honorable lycon,” Basara replied."
0,“Lady Ceil’s death is as great a risk for your kind as it is for ours.”
0,"“We do not trust in superstitions, mate of Zose,” the speaker announced flatly."
0,"“The situation is dire enough to make allies of enemies,” Byurk replied."
0,He gestured to Chloe and Justin.
0,“We have little way of proof to our claims other than these two here that are not of our world.”
0,"“Those two smell different than other humans, but we know nothing of other worlds."
0,This is a city of Lurr.
0,"Lycon are strong, but Lurr are stronger."
0,You have not located the one you seek and have no plan to reclaim her.
0,We cannot attack a city to search for one woman.”
0,"“Lemi and Inym are also gone,” Chloe added."
0,Her speaking was slow as she weaved together words in Elven.
0,“They might be there too.”
0,"“Or killed,” Thanysa replied."
0,"She was barely coherent having only just broken her hibernation after Tyree’s treatment, but she wanted to be part of the discussions nonetheless."
0,"“Our debt is for one life, not three,” the Lycon speaker asserted."
0,Zose shook his head.
0,“Those two are the responsibility of Basara and her party.
0,My request is only for Ceil.”
0,"“Inym is her own responsibility,” Basara corrected."
0,“We will do something about Lemi as we work to rescue Lady Ceil.
0,"Forgive Lady Chloe’s comment, honorable lycon."
0,In her heart she would rescue all who are in need and does not realize that in the wilderlands a life is merely another provision to be dealt and traded.”
0,The lycon stared at Chloe who shrunk back shyly in return.
0,“A caring heart is a rare commodity in these lands.
0,The wilderlands devour the meek.
0,She should take caution.”
0,"“Do not mistake meekness for frailty,” Byurk countered."
0,“Chloe may be our greatest asset and the strongest of us all.
0,She could destroy the city by her power alone.”
0,"“Then why seek our aid,” the speaker asked, clearly skeptical of Byurk’s boasting on Chloe’s behalf."
0,"“I do not want to,” Chloe responded in her defense."
0,“These Lurr are… are not bad.
0,"They are people, right?"
0,I do not want to hurt people that have not done wrong.”
0,“Ceil is held prisoner in the den of Lord Ni’inca Ab’pul.
0,"We need only involve the city as little as possible,” Zose clarified."
0,"“If we can find his hidden den, I can locate her, but we are without the numbers to extract her.”"
0,The speaker growled.
0,"“If she is possessed by that monster, she is lost."
0,He hunts lycon for sport when our numbers grow too large.
0,He is swifter than an arrow and deadlier than a dragon.
0,He cannot be killed.”
0,Justin whispered to Chloe who then relayed the message to Benab to translate.
0,“Sir Justin offers you a deal.
0,"If he provides the means for you to kill the Lord of Sen’uon, will you aid us?”"
0,The entire room turned to Justin in astonishment.
0,"The lycon clearly thought him mad, and those who knew of his affinity fought within their minds to explain why he would make such a bewildering offer and how he could provide such an opportunity."
0,"To Basara, he was an incompetent man who could hardly care for himself let alone kill a regular Lurr."
0,Byurk was the only one who seemed to catch onto a plausible reason or method or at least not question Justin’s statement.
0,"“Do you take us for fools,” the speaker growled."
0,Justin again spoke to Chloe who then had Benab translate.
0,“Sir Justin requests that the honorable lycon follow him for proof of his claim.”
0,The speaker for the lycon stood.
0,"When other lycon stood to follow, he growled at them."
0,Only he and Justin left the circular ruin.
0,"After a few minutes of waiting, they returned with an additional lycon that was not present in the meeting."
0,The speaker sat Justin on the side of the lycon and placed his hand on Justin’s nape.
0,“A deal has been struck.
0,We will aid in your rescue.
0,This is a chimera hunt!”
0,Chapter 14
0,“A Skewed Challenge”
1,“You are not getting any better.” Inym stood in front of Lemi who sat in the corner of the lowest level of Ceil’s room surrounded by plants provided by the Lurr.
0,"Lemi had succeeded in making leaves bloom on the shrubs’ branches, but they were wilting despite the clean water and care Lemi gave them."
0,The edges of few of the leaves were turning black and crumbling into powder.
0,Even Inym felt drained whenever she was near Ceil’s room.
0,"The sick aura was not as strong as the aura of death in the council room, but it was still present and palpable."
0,"“You said that you would recover quickly once you were surrounded by plants, but it’s been eight days."
0,You must realize that it is Ceil who is doing this to you.”
0,"“I know,” Lemi said with a smile, stunning Inym."
0,“Plants are very sensitive to changes in their environment.
0,I realized something was wrong when I was traveling with Ceil through Vallen.
0,"I spent most my time scouting ahead or with Sammy when my turn came for foraging, just to stay away from Ceil as much as possible."
0,"I got really sick in Revlan, so I started staying outside in the garden instead of inside with Ceil, thinking that might have been related.”"
0,Lemi’s hand rose to her mossy hair.
0,“My hair was so in bloom that you could only see white.
0,"When an anthousai becomes pregnant, their petals don’t immediately fall."
0,"Some petals fall shortly after childbirth, but usually it takes about a season or two for an anthousai to lose most her flowers after her first child is born, and she has a high chance of bearing more children during that time."
0,Now my hair is like this after only a few short days since leaving Melia.”
0,Inym held back her frown as she stared at Lemi’s wilting moss hair.
0,There were hardly any flowers left.
0,Lemi giggled.
0,"“Of course, the cold and wind didn’t help.”"
0,"“You cannot stay here,” Inym said sternly."
0,“I can’t leave Ceil now that I finally found her.
0,Justin and Chloe and Kiri will find us and rescue us.
0,"If not, as Ceil gets better, that evil power the chimera talked about will weaken."
0,"That’s what he said, right?”"
0,“Who knows how long that will take!
0,You saw that chimera.
0,"No one can kill that thing, and he will not let Ceil go.”"
0,Ceil was nothing more than a living doll.
0,"Lemi had cured Ceil’s injuries and ailments to the best of her abilities being only an apprentice shaman, but Ceil’s heart and mind had shut down."
0,There was no amount of healing Lemi could do to fix her now.
0,She still could not recognize her friend despite how much time Lemi spent with her.
0,“Your role here is done.
0,Ceil is healthy.
0,"If not for yourself, you need to leave for Sammy, your daughter."
0,Your waning health will affect her just as it affects you.”
0,Lemi tensed.
0,"Sure enough, she realized this as well."
0,“Have you been checking on her development?
0,Is she fine?”
0,"“She is fine,” Lemi said quickly, but her face lowered away from Inym’s stern gaze."
0,"“But she is not as healthy as she should be, correct?” Lemi did not answer, so Inym took her silence as affirmation."
0,“You need to leave.
0,I have freedom of movement for much of these ruins.
0,"I will search for the way back to that bewitched cave, but I am not sure how you will be able to get through it.”"
0,"“I know the way,” Lemi said, surprising Inym."
0,“The air in that cave was noxious.
0,"It made you and the Lurr act weird, but dryad bodies are different."
0,"We do not breathe the same air you breathe, so I was fine."
0,"As children, dryads are sent alone to all the surrounding villages to deliver things or relay messages, so we become good with directions."
0,"Even with a blindfold, I knew what direction we went and where we turned."
0,I know the way out.”
0,"“Then go,” Inym ordered, but Lemi still hesitated."
0,She grabbed Lemi’s arm and pulled her to her feet.
0,“Your child will die if you stay.
0,Go!”
0,Inym thrust Lemi towards the entryway to the room.
0,Lemi stumbled but caught her footing before she fell.
0,She looked up one last time at the third level of the room where Ceil lay in bed out of sight and then ran from the room.
1,Inym climbed the uneven steps to Ceil’s bedside.
0,She sat down on the stuffed furs and gripped Ceil’s fur covering with rigid fingers.
0,"“I could kill you now, and it would be so easy,” she grumbled."
0,"“I always hated Amel and the royal family, and now that the last survivor of that wretched dynasty is before me and so weak and helpless, I can do nothing!”"
0,Inym grabbed Ceil’s neck and lifted her so that they faced each other.
0,"Ceil’s eyes looked at her, but they did not see her."
0,“Tell me.
0,Why are trolls limited to one litter per woman?
0,Why was my husband executed for trying to provide me another when my first was stillborn?
0,Tell me!
0,Are you high elves so afraid of trolls outnumbering you?
0,Why did the first thing that happened to me after fleeing your terrible empire leave me unable to bear children.
0,Tell me…” Inym set Ceil gently back onto her bed.
0,She wrapped her arms around her and buried her face into Ceil’s bosom.
0,"“Please, give me my life back…”"
0,Sneaking through the noxious cave was far easier than Lemi expected.
0,The gasses dulled the senses of the Lurr who patrolled the tunnels.
0,The cave itself was a maze of strange stone tubes within tubes as if the stone had somehow melted and then hardened over and over again as it flowed in every direction.
0,"There were many shelves and holes to hide in until patrols passed, and the multi-layered tunnels often allowed her to move freely even when Lurr passed her above or below."
0,Lemi had never seen anything like this strange natural architecture.
0,"If it was outside in a verdant forest, she could imagine it being terribly fun to play in with the other girls of her village."
0,"The exit to the cave was guarded, but the two guards faced outwards, protecting against those who might try to sneak in, not out."
0,"Neither of them stood close to the stone, so Lemi carefully crept along the side of the cave and slipped out to the left behind them, the howling wind of the canyon protecting her silent steps from the keen ears of the Lurr."
0,She climbed the canyon slope and crept along the ridge out of sight of the guards.
0,"The ledge overhung the canyon path, shielding it from the sky and mountain tops."
0,"As Lemi climbed, the path disappeared into its natural camouflage."
0,"Unless one knew the entrance to the canyon valley, they would never know the cave or canyon was there."
0,Lemi continued towards Sen’uon and kept to the steep slopes of the city’s perimeter.
0,The Lurr who may have spotted her did not seem to care about a dryad in their city.
0,"Most the populous were citizens and likely not connected to the chimera despite being Lurr, or at least Lemi assumed after one Lurr waved to her as she passed."
0,The only location Lemi could not avoid was the narrow pass leading out of the Hemenonan range.
0,The guards there knew of her and that she was taken.
0,"The range itself near the pass was heavily guarded up the rocks, and should she be spotted climbing out of the range, that suspicion would be enough for them to attack her."
0,"She had a single plan, and if that did not work, she did not know what else to do."
1,Lemi made no attempt to hide as she walked out of Sen’uon for the pass.
0,"The guards took notice quickly, and the large Lurr troll approached."
0,"“I was forced to leave,” Lemi explained before the massive guard could speak."
0,"“I didn’t want to leave Ceil behind, but I was getting sick being in there."
0,"I am pregnant, and so for my daughter’s sake, I was forced to leave.” Lemi let her honest, dejected heart show on her face."
0,"The guard knelt and looked at the young, wilting dryad."
0,She was in far worse state than when she had tried to sneak into the pass eight days ago.
0,"“Will you be safe leaving Sen’uon,” he asked."
0,"“Dryads are less affected by the cold, and we can go days without food so long as there is sunlight.”"
0,The guard lifted Lemi.
0,She panicked a little until he set her on his shoulder.
0,He carried her through the pass and south to the road.
0,"Once he set her down in the shelter of one of the nearby ruins, he knelt to speak with her again."
0,"“If you leave the road and head south, there is a shallow ravine that follows east along most the exposed stretch of road."
0,"Once it reaches the surface, follow the wind, and you will reach the ravine the road passes through before long."
0,It is the safest path to return.”
0,"“You are kind,” Lemi said, not expecting such treatment."
0,"“As the gatekeeper of Sen’uon, I must protect the city from those who might mean harm."
0,We are not violent without reason.” The massive troll gently pushed Lemi’s back with his large hand.
0,"“Thank you,” Lemi said before running south."
1,"In her weakened state, the winds were almost too much for Lemi to endure."
0,"Instead of traveling south, the winds forced her southeast, but she eventually reached the ravine the guard mentioned."
0,"There the winds swept over her, allowing her to travel west."
0,"She peeked up from time to time at the Hemenonan range to the north to gauge how far she needed to travel, looking for familiar markers on the steep peaks."
0,"She passed where she believed her camp was located, hoping that they would still be there, and let the wind push her northeast as she traveled to meet it."
0,"Before Lemi could meet the first ruins at the base of the Hemenonan range, a swift body dashed with the wind and pounced on her."
0,"She tumbled with him across the snow until his hands and feet dug into the ground, slowing them to a stop."
0,"The wolf-like beast was something Lemi had never seen before, and she feared it was a Lurr who caught her going against the guard’s instructions."
0,Two more similar persons arrived quickly and bound her.
0,Lemi stayed silent in fearful anxiety as they led her north for the ruins.
0,She quickly recognized the location and that they were headed for her camp.
0,"“Are you with Basara,” she asked."
0,"When she received no answer, her panic grew."
0,“What happened to everyone in the camp?”
0,Lemi feared that her party might have been attacked by these wolf-people.
0,She looked to the tops of the ruins and found more of them keeping watch.
0,"The large, tilted, cylindrical ruin Basara chose for the camp came into view, and she saw Benab sitting atop one of the crumbled walls on the outside next to another of the wolf-people."
0,“Benab!” Lemi screamed his name with all her might.
0,The creature next to him nudged him with its leg and pointed down to Lemi.
0,Benab looked down at her and ran for the inside of the ruin with all haste.
0,Tears fell from Lemi’s eyes as she saw Chloe and Justin and others from her party flood out of the ruin to greet her.
0,She was quickly unbound and gathered in Chloe and Justin’s embrace.
0,* * *
1,Coby soared over the sheer peaks of the Hemenonan range with Lemi’s arms in his talons.
0,"Kiri struggled behind, not only against the sharp winds and cold but also simply keeping pace with the large hawk."
0,"“Down,” Lemi ordered, and Coby descended to the nearest mountain peak, setting Lemi on the rocky slope."
0,"At this elevation, even she shivered, and the chill of the stone stung her feet."
0,"Kiri landed beside her, and Coby quickly covered the two in his wings as a shield against the wind."
0,"“Do you know where you are,” Kiri asked, fighting to keep her teeth from clattering."
0,"“I know that mountain,” Lemi said, pointing to the east."
0,“Sen’uon is not far on the other side.
0,She scanned the mountains and steep valleys between.
0,The canyon was well hidden as she had seen from further below during her escape two days ago.
0,"“There,” she pointed in excitement."
0,“It’s over there.”
0,Kiri looked where Lemi pointed but could not see anything that might even warrant suspicion.
0,A Melian’s vision was truly an astounding gift.
0,"“If the canyon is there, then…” Lemi’s voice trailed off."
0,She followed some invisible trail west with her eyes.
0,"“Coby, fly.”"
0,Coby once again grabbed Lemi in his talons and took off in the direction Lemi pointed.
0,They crossed one ridge before Lemi asked to be set down again on the ridge’s far slope.
0,Now even Kiri could see what Lemi had likely been searching for.
0,"Down in the valley past the slope, the crumbled top of a buried ruin stuck out above the ground as if it had been pinched between the mountains."
0,"“It almost looked like the crested roof of the Amelian Palace,” Kiri explained to the gathering around the fire back at camp."
0,“That should be part of the same ruins.
0,"The den is somewhere underneath, but it doesn’t look like there is a way in from above,” Lemi added."
0,"“Did you see any Lurr guarding the top of the ruin,” the lycon speaker asked."
0,"“If Lemi could not see any, then they are either well-hidden or there are none,” Kiri answered."
0,"“Then my turn has come,” Zose announced."
0,Coby flew both Zose and Basara one at a time to the ruin Lemi located.
0,"Basara was there both to protect Coby until Zose returned and keep Coby warm, as night was setting in and they were exposed."
0,“Be careful.
0,"The Lord of Sen’uon is not like other Chimera,” Basara warned."
0,“You have never once asked me to take care when I go off on a subjugation contract.
0,"No need to start now,” Zose replied with confidence."
0,"“Besides, I am only searching for Ceil."
0,"I’ll be fine.” He also planned to search for the chimera, but he kept that to himself."
0,“You injured your knee descending a mountain.
0,You are over four years old.
0,You are not as young as you once were.”
0,“I couldn’t take the whistle with me into the stone.
0,"Coby heard my whistle and found me, so it’s fine.”"
0,“And if he did not?
0,"I do worry, a lot."
0,"I have been thinking this for a while now, but you should retire from being a hunter mercenary."
0,I am sure Jit could employ you at the exchange.”
0,"“Then I’ll quit,” Zose replied immediately."
0,“I can’t have you setting Ib’nua aflame worrying over me.”
0,Basara exhaled an exasperated sigh but then smiled.
0,"“Go,” she said before leaning in to give Zose a kiss."
0,"As their lips parted, Zose lightly pinched Basara’s side making her jolt."
0,"“Go,” she ordered again with a glower, pushing Zose down through the stone."
1,"The ruins below were just as Zose expected, crushed beyond comprehension."
0,"There were small pockets of air, but if they wanted to infiltrate through these ruins, earth mages would be needed."
0,"Thanysa was a conjurer with only weak alteration abilities, so the main bulk of the work would be shouldered by Byurk."
0,The destruction of the ruins made following them down much harder.
0,"Zose spread his shapeless form as far as he could to search for where the ruins continued, but the more he searched, the more he felt that Lemi had been mistaken."
0,"The lower he descended, the more metals he found, not ruins."
0,The ore veins were so thick that he couldn’t pass through most of them.
0,"Nearly exhausting himself, he returned to the surface."
1,"“No luck,” he told Basara as she warmed him."
0,"“The ruins were crushed, and there is no sign of them below, almost as if this roof was dropped here from the sky.”"
0,Basara watched the mountains slowly grow darker in the shade of the approaching night as she held Zose.
0,"The more she stared at the beautiful mountain scenery, the more the mountains almost appeared tilted at an angle."
0,The south-facing slopes were far sheerer than the north.
0,"“These mountains were created by the gods according to legend,” she mused."
0,“What if it was just an extremely powerful form of earth magic?”
0,"“I would hate to meet the one who did it,” Zose laughed."
0,“Think about it.
0,The ruins on the south face of the Hemenonan range creep up the mountainside as if upheaved or plowed.
0,"The mountains lean away from the Afarit, the center of the destruction."
0,What if they did not rise from the ground so much as they were forced outward from the epicenter?”
0,“Then the ruins might have been dragged by the mountains.
0,It wouldn’t continue directly below us but further south!
0,This roof is just what remained on the surface as it moved!”
1,Zose kissed Basara and dove back down into the ruins so quickly Coby gave a startled cry and stamped around in irritation.
0,"He searched further south as he descended, and although there were still veins of ore, he also found stone matching the ruins crushed within the rocks."
0,He followed the trail of crushed stone and reached his first intact structure.
0,"It was nothing more than an isolated tower, but he knew now he was headed in the right direction."
0,The number and completeness of the buried ruins increased.
0,"Just as Basara had theorized, a massive temple or castle was buried deep underground at a southward slant as if pushed by the mountains."
0,"The outer walls were obliterated, but the inner structure, its rooms and corridors and halls, were mostly intact, and Lurr inhabited them."
0,He found it.
0,"Phasing through the aged stone was incredibly easy, but there was something Zose had not expected."
0,Channels for natural gas had been constructed creating massive furnaces along many of the walls for both light and heat.
0,The stone along the largest rooms was often so hot that Zose could not pass through.
0,"While this did make inspecting the larger rooms difficult, it also meant that there should be vents to the surface to replace the air consumed by the plentiful flames, or perhaps another entrance."
0,"If not, the noxious gas in the cave leading to the entrance would be sucked into the ruins, or so Zose assumed at least."
0,He was no architect.
0,"He now had three goals: finding Ceil, finding the chimera, and finding the vents."
0,Zose’s newest goal ended up being the first completed.
0,"While traveling along the ceiling of the grandest hall, he found several circular stone vents leading up through the mountain."
0,Following one brought him to the surface of the northward-facing slope of the ridge just south of the ruins.
0,"From there he could just barely see the roof on the surface in the last remaining light of day, although he was too far away to see where Basara and Coby hid."
0,The vent was wide enough for a lithe body to enter and not too steep to descend.
0,"If they brought a rope, they could be lowered into the grand hall."
0,"The only problem was that whoever entered via the vents would be exposed there in the hall, and many of the lycon would not fit in the vent."
0,"For now, it could serve as a secondary entrance."
0,"After a short rest in the cold, Zose descended through the stone of the vent back to the large hall."
0,He moved through the corridor to the west but could not see what lay within the large room at the end.
0,Something was wrong with the stone.
0,He could not tell what it was.
0,"Something permeated through it that felt off, almost sickly."
0,"No sound vibrated through the stone, so the room was likely empty, but he could not move to the stone’s face to peer into the room."
0,"Perhaps this was the chimera’s lair, and in the chimera’s long and ageless years it had developed the means to prevent oreads from spying."
0,Zose had no way of knowing.
0,"Instead, he returned to the hall and traveled down the left corridor."
0,"He did not travel far before the stone began to pulse, and the deeper he traveled into the maze of ruins interconnected by volcanic caves and tunnels, the louder the pulse became until it sounded like a heartbeat."
0,Zose quickly realized that the sound was indeed a heartbeat.
0,It moved through the tunnels and approached his location.
0,Zose held his nonexistent breath as a long and gangly chimera passed through the tunnel walking on bone spikes protruding from its fore-elbows.
0,"Before leaving the tunnel, the chimera stopped and turned to look back down the tunnel."
0,"His neck extended to an incredible length, and he began inspecting walls near where Zose resided."
0,"The moment Zose phased back deeper into the stone to not be caught, the chimera vanished."
0,Zose could feel the reverberations of its swift movements down the tunnels.
0,"Just as the lycon had warned, this chimera’s speed defied all reason."
0,"Zose quickly left the area in the opposite direction, returning to the grand hall."
0,He needed to hurry.
0,The number of Lurr was already increasing.
0,"He had been discovered, which could prove dangerous for Ceil whom he had yet to locate."
0,"The corridor to the right of the hall was similar to the left, only there were far more ruins and fewer ancient lava caves."
0,The ruins plowed by the mountains seemed to gather here and perhaps cushioned the grand hall protecting it from complete destruction.
0,Those ruins were hollowed out into the most bizarre caves as if this was some mad architect’s life work.
0,Rooms and passageways spread in all directions creating a literal maze for any who could not simply pass through the stone like him.
0,The trouble became locating Ceil among this maze of ruins before his discovery could endanger her.
0,"Lurr ran down nearly every passageway, and earth mages held their hands to the stone sending out pulses of ven to find him."
0,"Zose could only distance himself, ridding him of his vision of the mazing passageways."
0,He could only feel the subtle and muffled vibrations of movement and the pulses that never quite propagated far enough to detect him.
0,It was like watching ripples in still water to determine the shape of the channels the water flowed through.
0,"As Zose observed the sound and pulses, he noticed one area he was blind."
0,There were no steps or noises nor pulses of ven.
0,"The Lurr avoided that location, but there were surely passageways leading to it."
0,"Zose moved directly above the location and found it just wide enough that if he centered himself, the pulses searching for him could not reach him."
0,There he descended and found a single room.
1,"Once again there was a sickly aura permeating the face of the stone, but it was nowhere near as strong as the larger room connected to the grand hall."
0,"Moving to the face of the stone only made him feel nauseous, but that was the extent of it."
0,"Inside, an anorexic troll woman wearing the bare minimum of coverings in the warm room tended to an elf girl."
0,It was Ceil.
0,"He found her, but she did not look well."
0,"The troll, likely Inym by Basara’s description, held Ceil’s head up and poured water slowly into her mouth with a wooden ladle."
0,"Ceil was not limp and lifeless but at the same time, she did not take any action for herself."
0,"“Inym,” Zose spoke quietly from the ceiling."
0,"Inym’s drooping ears twitched, and she looked around the room for the source of the noise."
0,"“Inym, I am Zose.”"
0,"The moment Zose mentioned his name, Inym acted as if she had never heard the noise and returned to Ceil, but the light pivoting of her ears showed she was waiting for when he would next speak."
0,"“We are formulating a plan to rescue you and Ceil, but we will need your cooperation."
0,"I was discovered by Lord Ab’pul, so you need to protect Ceil until we can reach you.” Zose knew he was asking the impossible."
0,"If his discovery did endanger Ceil and Inym, Inym had no hope of fending off so many Lurr."
0,"“The Lurr sure are noisy today,” Inym said as if speaking to Ceil."
0,“I guess I should be grateful that you repel them.
0,And I have no need to worry.
0,I am the only one they have to take care of you.”
0,Zose immediately realized that Inym meant both she and Ceil were in no danger.
0,"“Maybe your friends discovered where you are,” Inym continued."
0,“They should give up on you.
0,You are safer here than with them.
0,Tolmyur cannot reach you here under the protection of Lord Ab’pul.”
0,"“Inym!” A female Lurr stood in the entryway to the room, but she dared not enter."
0,She looked to the upper level of the room where Inym sat with Ceil.
0,"“An oread has infiltrated the lair, likely Zose."
0,Have you been contacted by the intruder?”
0,Zose’s fears were unfolding before his eyes.
0,He quickly moved through the stone to the entryway and gathered the part of him that was his two bone blades.
0,"“I have,” Inym replied promptly."
0,"“Had you not asked, I would have kept it secret."
0,Zose informed me that he will attempt to rescue Ceil.”
0,Zose wanted to curse Inym.
0,The Lord of Sen’uon must have bribed her or otherwise forced her compliance.
0,“Do you know his plans or where he is now?”
0,“I do not.
0,His voice came from the stone but fell silent when you arrived.
0,"Even if he told me his plan, I would not tell you.”"
0,Zose was about to strike the Lurr down but stopped.
0,Inym had not completely sided with the Lurr.
0,“You betray Lord Ni’inca Ab’pul?” The Lurr’s eyes grew red.
0,“I was paid to protect and care for Ceil.
0,"You succeeded in stealing her from Zose’s companions, and now he has come to reclaim her."
0,"If he and those with him can best your lord, that proves she is safer with them."
0,"If he cannot succeed despite his efforts, Ceil will remain your prisoner here."
0,"Either way, I have no part in your competition with Zose."
0,"My duty is Ceil’s care, and I will continue that charge no matter who holds her chains.”"
0,Inym’s words were directed at both Zose and the Lurr equally.
0,"She would provide neither with aid, and Zose could not fault her."
0,That was the best route for ensuring her safety.
0,"However, the weight of her challenge was not distributed equally between Zose and the Lord of Sen’uon."
0,"Having revealed that he was preparing to rescue Ceil, the defenses of the lair would increase."
0,Inym was clearly wagering on the side of whom she felt had the highest chance of victory.
0,The full power of the Ni’inca Ab’pul and his Lurr would be on display.
0,Such a barrier would not be overcome easily.
0,"Should he fail, Ceil certainly would be better protected here, but such survival was not the same as living."
0,Protection should never be a shackle.
0,"Zose wanted Ceil to be freed from her ever-tightening chains of pain and fear, not be devoured by them."
0,Zose’s arms appeared from the stone and beheaded the Lurr in one crossing stroke of his two blades.
0,Inym grunted and turned Ceil away from the headless body.
0,"She was not silent in her challenge, so Zose did not doubt that other Lurr outside the room heard, but if there was any chance that they did not, he needed to take that glimmer of hope."
1,Zose quickly returned to Basara without further word to Inym.
0,She reached down and lifted him from the stone.
0,She was about to ask about his search but noticed the urgency in his eyes.
0,"“I found Ceil, but there is a problem.”"
0,Chapter 15
0,“Disturbing a Chimera’s Nest”
0,"“When the brood-lord is killed, the other Lurr in the brood immediately lose their attachment to the location and flee."
0,"With the place swarming in Lurr, the quickest and safest route is to kill the chimera first,” Benab asserted."
0,"“That way of thinking only works in regular Lurr nests,” Basara countered."
0,"“The Lurr here are no less intelligent than us, perhaps even more so, and Lord Ab’pul especially so."
0,Killing him does not guarantee that they will let us escape.
0,"For most chimera nests, there are often other highly evolved Lurr in the brood that immediately claim control of the brood."
0,Sen’uon is an advanced Lurr society.
0,There is bound to be a command hierarchy.
0,"Lord Ab’pul seems determined to keep Ceil contained at all cost, so whoever succeeds his position is bound to do the same.”"
0,"The leaders of the lycon, Tolmyur, and Vallen groups gathered around the campfire to discuss strategy."
0,"The lycon were prepared to toss as many bodies as needed at the chance to kill Ni’inca Ab’pul, and more clans arrived by the day."
0,"Byurk was likewise willing to sacrifice himself and his men if needed, but his survival was seen as a priority to everyone else due to his relationship with Jethro."
0,"The Vallen party was also willing to lay down their lives to rescue Ceil, but they had two members whose lives were of greater value than them all, Justin and Chloe."
0,"They should be involved as little as possible, but at the same time, they were this mission’s greatest assets."
0,"Justin had already agreed to fight on the frontlines with the lycon, further complicating the issue because it was only through Justin’s involvement that the lycon agreed to help."
0,"“Do you know the estimated population of Sen’uon,” Byurk asked."
0,"“If striking down the leader will not stop them, we should at least know their numbers.”"
0,"“The city houses about a thousand Lurr, or maybe a little less,” Zose replied."
0,“Most of them should be civilians living there to avoid conflict with other races.
0,"There were only about ten or so visible in the lair when I first searched it, but once I was discovered it increased to maybe a hundred in a manner of minutes.”"
0,"“Then we only have numbers to match the lair,” the speaker for the lycon announced."
0,“Your failure to remain hidden in your search has eliminated many options.
0,The chimera will not leave the nest now that he knows we seek his prey.”
0,"“I admit my failure,” Zose apologized with his head bowed."
0,"“I was unaware that he could detect me in the stone without using earth magic, but unplanned situations are common in any chimera subjugation, and an ancient chimera only increases that danger."
0,"No matter how much we plan, trusting something to go as planned may be a fatal mistake."
0,"If we cannot adapt immediately to whatever we encounter, we are dead.”"
0,"The meeting ended after drafting initial plans for infiltration and extraction with multiple variations for common occurrences in chimera subjugations based on Byurk, Zose, and Basara’s hunter mercenary experience."
1,"On the eve of battle, only the most seasoned soldier or one with the most tranquil of spirits could sleep peacefully."
0,"Justin spent much of the long night atop the ruins with the lycon staring out into the dark, monolithic peaks."
0,The night would have made them invisible if not for the very faint red-ochre alpenglow from the distant Afarit lining their silhouettes like a single jagged crack crossing the dark.
0,"Byurk, Thanysa, and a single human soldier with weak earth magic were already at the slopes of the sheer mountain face working through the night to create a path up and through the mountain."
0,"The lair was located to the northeast, so if they could scale the steepest outer face, they could hike to the lair and avoid Sen’uon altogether."
0,"Lycon were incredibly athletic and could climb the mountain, but a path was needed to conserve as much energy as was possible for the upcoming confrontation against a species that far outclassed all of them in strength and endurance."
0,"Justin’s thoughts fell upon Lurr Eydis, drawing up lingering and conflicting feelings of both disdain and longing."
0,"The true Eydis was a little stronger than the average human, especially Justin, but Lurr Eydis was so powerful that she could charge through the brick wall of a house without slowing."
0,"That was the strength they would face on the morrow, only multiplied many times over."
0,"In truth, Justin pitied the Lurr."
0,"The wilderlands were harsh, but other races were able to build cities and towns that were comfortable enough for the terrain and climate."
0,"In Hen’anin, the Lurr who were seen as outcasts by most races lived in precarious and run-down shacks teetering on the slope of a mountain, just trying to eke out the most meager existence."
0,"They never asked to be born as Lurr, to have to feast on flesh to grow and develop into something with the power to feel or reason."
0,"The few lucky ones were like Lurr Eydis, given the chance to become a person, but most failed in their evolution, becoming nothing more than hungering beasts preying on whatever ecosystem they found themselves in, hunted by all out of fear, even their more successful kin."
0,"Every Lurr initially had the potential to become a thinking, feeling individual like Lurr Eydis, able to hate, regret, learn, love, and more."
0,The Lurr of Sen’uon were not enemies.
0,"They were the lucky ones among their kind just trying to live in a world that hated them, but for the sole crime of stealing away someone Justin was determined to protect, he would help lead a task force to kill them as if they were no different than those failed monsters."
0,"The thought made Justin sick, as if he was killing Lurr Eydis with his own hands."
0,Justin closed his eyes and began meditating.
0,Perhaps another week or two with his thoughts would help sort out his feelings enough to allow some rest.
0,* * *
1,Sunrise.
0,Basara and Chloe left camp for the pass.
0,Zose had already gone ahead to monitor the movement of the Lurr within Sen’uon.
0,"He had argued initially that the two most powerful among them should be a direct part of the mission, but Basara refused."
0,"She and Chloe were too powerful to select for the fight inside the underground caves and ruins, especially for Chloe who lacked control of her explosive flame."
0,"Basara had another plan that used their power just the same, and at least in her case, her power was known by the gatekeeper of Sen’uon."
0,Basara eyed the rocks above as she entered the pass.
0,"Normally the Lurr stationed above would keep hidden until the visitors were proven to be a threat, but now there were many visible among the crags and outcroppings."
0,"“Basara, it has been three years since you last visited Sen’uon,” the gatekeeper spoke in a loud echoing voice as he approached, using the maenad tongue of the northeastern wilderlands."
0,"“Forgive my impertinence, but you are not permitted to enter Sen’uon.”"
0,"Basara shook her head and replied in Elven, setting the language for the discussion so Chloe could understand."
0,“You dare bar my path?”
0,The Lurr hidden among the rocks revealed themselves.
0,"Sure enough, the guard had increased at least threefold."
0,The Lord of Sen’uon was wary after detecting Zose in his lair.
0,“Sen’uon is closed.
0,"No matter the traveler or their business, none are permitted to enter or leave until Lord Ni’inca Ab’pul gives word.”"
0,"“My husband, Zose, has taken upon himself a contract without knowing the grave hidden dangers it posed."
0,I am here to see him safe and returned home to me.
0,I know he is in your city.
0,I ask you again… Do you dare block my path?”
0,Many Lurr appeared from the surrounding peaks and climbed or jumped down into the pass.
0,More filtered in through the narrow split through the rock acting as the gate to Sen’uon.
0,"The massive Lurr took two steps forward and asserted his guard, seemingly growing even larger in stature."
0,"“I have heard legend of your power, but you are still only two women."
0,"I mean no disrespect to you or your husband, but unknown dangers are part of any hunter mercenary contract."
0,You cannot enter.
0,We will turn you away by force if necessary.”
0,“And I am willing to destroy your city if only to see my husband safely returned to me.
0,This woman at my side is a maenad whose flame surpasses my own.
0,"No matter your numbers, we could raze your city to the ground."
0,Zose knows my temper.
0,"Once he sees our flame, he will know to hide in the stone."
0,Only an oread could survive the wake of our destruction.”
0,"A warning arrow was fired from behind the gatekeeper, aimed between Basara and Chloe’s heads, but the moment it approached within a foot of Basara, it burst out away from them into molten sparks and ash."
0,“I have given my demand.” Basara glared into the unwavering eyes of the gatekeeper.
0,"A rush of heated wind blew out from Basara through the entire pass, instantly melting all the frost and snow into wafting vapor."
0,"When the wind calmed, the air of the pass was as hot as a desert in the height of summer."
0,“Do not make me ask again.”
0,* * *
1,A column of frozen mist rose as the steam from the melted snow left the pass into the frigid air to be carried away by the wind.
0,"Zose stared up at the signal to start the operation, one Basara would not have created if she had felt the number of Lurr in the pass insufficient."
0,Basara’s task was to hold them in the pass in a deadlock as long as possible.
0,"Neither she nor Chloe wanted to fight them, and surely the Lurr would not want to fight Basara."
0,"An impasse was the goal, but should violence break out, Basara felt better about killing the chimera’s brood--Lurr working directly for the Lord of Sen’uon--than killing the innocent civilians of the city."
0,Most the Lurr in Sen’uon were rapidly evacuating to the underground caves to hide from whatever threat just arrived in the pass.
0,"Zose was pleased to see that his assumption was correct, that most the Lurr in Sen’uon were civilians that wanted to avoid conflict."
0,"Any guards that were in the city acting on Lord Ab’pul’s command had rushed to the pass, and a group from the west that had possibly guarded the path to the canyon also joined."
0,"With this, there would be fewer potential reinforcements in the lair."
0,Zose headed for the canyon following Lemi’s description of its location now that Basara had given her truthful excuse for her presence at the pass.
0,"The entrance to the canyon was no more than a fissure in a rock face that anyone would easily miss, but once entered it opened into a deep chasm shielded above by overlapping outcroppings."
0,"The cave entrance sat at the far end of the canyon, guarded by only two Lurr."
0,Zose crept through the stone to the rocks nearest the first guard.
0,He gathered his shapeless form and concentrated it at a single point on the rock’s surface.
0,"With his blades in hand, he sprung from the rock face using the force of his body regaining its form, lunging far faster than what would otherwise be physically possible."
0,"His blade plunged through the fur, leather, and muscle into the back of the first Lurr, piercing its heart."
0,The second Lurr turned for the cave about to run to report the attack.
0,"If Zose let him go, he had no hope of catching him."
0,Zose sank his foot under the soil and sent it immediately below the Lurr’s anchor leg.
0,"The very moment the Lurr sprung to dash into the cave, Zose’s foot rose beneath it at a skewed angle."
0,"Instead of propelling the Lurr forward, the force of his lunge sent the Lurr to the side straight at Zose."
0,"Using the Lurr’s own momentum and surprise, he slid his knife across the Lurr’s neck as it passed, carving deep and halfway severing its neck."
0,"Lurr were powerful, but with skill and the right opportunity, that power could be used against them."
0,Zose pulled his foot back through the ground and winced as he wrapped it with a sash woven from his own hair.
0,His ankle was broken as were several bones in his foot.
0,"So long as he sank his feet into the ground as he walked, the injury would not hinder him."
0,"“Basara’s going to be furious,” Zose sighed."
0,He retrieved the blade lodged in the first Lurr’s back with strenuous effort and then moved the bodies out of sight of the cave entrance.
0,"After clearing the blood to the best of his ability, he sank back into the ground by the entrance and waited."
0,"Until the lycon replaced him, his first role was to guard the lair entrance so that no Lurr could request reinforcements from the pass."
0,* * *
1,"“We have orders to move Lady Ceil,” the new Lurr attendant announced from the door."
0,Inym felt something was about to happen when the noise outside the room had slowly increased and all lights had quickly been extinguished.
0,Zose’s rescue mission had likely begun.
0,Inym scooped Ceil into her arms and carried her to the door.
0,"Once she left the room, another two Lurr entered and extinguished the braziers."
0,"The ruin cave quickly became blacker than night, and at the same time, two small rings of red appeared from where the new attendant stood."
0,Inym shrank as horrid memories of countless red eyes in abyssal blackness plagued her mind.
0,"“Come,” the eyes ordered walking backwards, and Inym struggled to follow."
0,"In all the caves and ruins, there was no light."
0,"Every furnace, torch, and brazier had been extinguished."
0,"Only a Lurr’s eye could pierce the darkness, led by their own subdued glow that was only powerful enough for them to see."
0,Inym could only make out the vague pattern of the walls near where the attendant walked and only if the attendant walked right beside the wall.
0,Even a spriggan would be troubled in this suffocating dark.
0,"After following a maze of caverns, the noise of Lurr scrambling around the lair making preparations began to echo."
0,"The red dots of eyes increased, and their location showed the hall she entered was vast, the grand hall where she met the Lord of Sen’uon."
0,"Inym tried to follow the red of the attendant’s eyes, but the longer she remained in the dark hall with only red eyes moving all about her, the less her legs moved."
0,"Her emotional strength failed her, and she dropped to her knees."
0,Her breath grew erratic.
0,She held Ceil tighter and tighter and suppressed the cry threatening to escape her throat.
0,“Move!
0,"We do not have the time!” The attendant’s eyes flared, lighting the floor around Inym for a moment."
0,Inym’s cry broke out in fear.
0,She couldn’t move.
0,"While Inym had expressed that she would not help either side in this conflict, the Lurr had not accounted for Inym’s trauma inhibiting their preparations."
0,"“You, bring rope and bind her and the girl together!” the attendant ordered to another."
0,"A moment later, a new pair of red eyes drew close."
0,"Inym screamed and tried to scramble away with Ceil, but the vice-like grip of the Lurr snagged her arm."
0,"“No, let go of me,” Inym hollered."
0,She felt the rope wind around her and Ceil in her arms.
0,"She soon felt hot, viscous moisture and smelled a rotten stench."
0,"The rope fell slack, and the red eyes vanished."
0,"“You and you, continue binding them until the rope is secure.”"
0,Two more Lurr closed in.
0,Inym felt the rope tighten.
0,"In time, one pair of eyes dimmed, and after one final tug that held Ceil painfully close against Inym’s chest, the second pair of eyes dimmed and vanished."
0,"The final Lurr collapsed on Inym, and she felt his flesh melt over her."
0,Inym recalled the melted corpses in the council room.
0,A new trauma melded with her former.
0,"Inym’s cries became frantic screams as the attendant dragged her across the hall to the same corridor down which the chimera left after their meeting days before, a corridor that led to that chimera’s nest."
0,“Please!
0,I’m sorry!
0,I’m sorry!
0,Forgive me!
0,Let me go!”
0,* * *
1,Beads of sweat ran down Byurk’s face.
0,He had been working through the night creating a passage over the steep mountains to the ruins Zose said would lead to Ceil.
0,He sat back against the wall of a cave dug by him and his earth mage accomplice to reach Ceil’s room.
0,They had begun digging the moment they saw the cloud of steam rising from the pass over the mountains.
0,Tae placed her hand on Byurk’s forehead and slowly refilled his ven using one of the few lycon accompanying them in the cave.
0,"Lycon could not use magic, so they had little use for their ven."
0,"Tae stopped draining the lycon at half capacity so that ven exhaustion did not inhibit their combat capabilities, constantly apologizing that she was not as fast or skilled as Tyree."
0,"Sure enough, about half the ven she transferred leaked out and dispersed."
0,"Tyree was reserved in case of a medical emergency for Ceil, Chloe, or Justin."
0,"“Switch,” Byurk’s earth mage soldier announced, stumbling over his feet from both ven and physical exhaustion."
0,Tae quickly moved to him.
0,“We are close.
0,I found the tower Zose mentioned.
0,"If we go any further, their earth mages might detect us."
0,"As soon as I have the energy, I will inform the lycon waiting at the surface.”"
0,"“Do so,” Byurk affirmed."
0,"He was skeptical at first of how willing his men would be to help the Vallen party rescue Ceil, but for the most part they still obeyed Byurk without issue."
0,"Those who most respected Byurk trusted him and his decision to provide all aid, and the few others believed he was simply deceiving the Vallen party to find the right opportunity to capture or kill Ceil."
0,"In either case, they would pull their weight in the rescue, but Byurk needed to be careful of those who might want to harm Ceil should they have the chance."
0,Any soldier whose heart he did not trust fully was left to guard the camp during the rescue.
0,"The rest, aside from this single earth mage, would join the lycon at the frontal assault that should begin soon."
0,"Zose’s arrival from the cave entrance in the canyon would signal that the frontal assault had begun, and then Byurk would finish breaking through to Ceil’s room."
0,"Until then, he could rest."
0,"“The ruins are dark,” a voice spoke from the cave wall near Byurk."
0,"He did not have to wait long for Zose’s arrival, and now no rest would come until after he broke into the ruins."
0,Such was the life of a soldier.
0,"At least after breaking in, he could rest as he waited for his role in the extraction."
1,"Zose exited the stone and sat down on the ground, but he kept one of his feet inside the stone."
0,“Everything was quiet.
0,"I could not see any Lurr, nor could I hear anything."
0,I doubt the lair has been evacuated.
0,They are ready for us.”
0,“What of the room?
0,Did you scout it?” Byurk asked.
0,"“I did, but it was also dark."
0,"Unlike before, no earth mages were searching for me."
0,"I feel the location might be compromised, but for now it’s our only main entrance."
0,"Many Lurr gathered at the entrance to the lair from the caves, so there should be less of them around the room, but I doubt they think us foolish enough to only attack the entrance."
0,They will be waiting for us here.”
0,"“Do I break into her room or do we signal those at the vents,” Byurk asked, trusting the oread’s scouting ability."
0,"“Break into the room,” Zose ordered."
0,"Byurk hopped to his feet and continued parting the stone diagonally downward, hardening it once he pushed it aside to reinforce the walls of the tunnel to prevent collapse."
0,The human earth mage then removed Tae’s hand from his forehead and ran back up the tunnel to inform the awaiting lycon.
0,"Now that Tae was free, Zose removed his foot from the stone."
0,It had swollen considerably.
0,“What happened?” Tae asked.
0,"“A Lurr stepped on it,” Zose grimaced."
0,Tae placed her hand on his ankle.
0,“It’s badly broken.
0,I am not skilled enough to mend this severe of a break.
0,"I can do a little, and I will need to use your ven to heal it."
0,Is that fine?”
0,“It is.
0,Just fix it enough to mitigate the pain.
0,"So long as I keep my foot in stone, it loses its form and should not worsen as fast.”"
0,"“Will your injury hinder your search for the Lord of Sen’uon,” Byurk asked back over his shoulder."
0,“No.
0,"As soon as Tae is finished, I will depart for the vent where Justin is waiting."
0,"Make certain your team finds Ceil while Justin’s is contending with the chimera,” Zose warned Thanysa as she arrived with the elves, Hethyro, and the lycon who had been waiting on the surface."
0,"“The room is empty,” Byurk warned as he rushed back up the tunnel."
0,“It is likely a trap.”
0,"“Breach it,” Thanysa ordered."
0,"“Trap or not, we must enter.” She drew her weapon, and the others followed."
0,"Several lycon brandished small, compressed metal bows strapped to their forearms that fired bolts; a peculiar technology they claimed would help contend against the Lurr’s superior strength and magic."
0,"Not only did the small bows fire with the same power as a full-length wooden bow, but the bolts were also tipped with a numbing poison to counter a Lurr’s superior reflexes and speed, should it hit."
0,"“Be ready,” Byurk warned."
0,“There is a chance that the Chimera and Ceil switched places.”
0,"“If so, I will send Justin’s party to you."
0,"Hold out until then,” Zose replied just before diving into the stone."
0,"Byurk scanned for Zose, and seeing that he did not immediately return, he knew the room remained clear."
0,"He took a deep breath, and wedged his fingers into the stone before him, tearing it apart to both sides."
0,A tunnel grew fifteen yards deep.
1,Byurk ran down to the stone at the end with the search party close behind.
0,"After tearing the final fifteen yards open, he breached the room."
0,Byurk moved to the side as the elf party rushed past.
0,"He then took up the rear, jumping down last."
0,"When he landed, he immediately felt something wrong."
0,“They are collapsing the room!”
0,Earth ven surged through all the stone making it brittle.
0,"Byurk gripped the ruin stone at his feet and countered the opposing ven with his, strengthening the walls and ceiling about the room, but it was a losing battle."
0,“They are in the passageways surrounding the room!
0,I cannot hold it!” Byurk called.
0,"The lycon acted first, dashing from the room into the dark."
0,Byurk did not know the number of Lurr earth mages.
0,"He could not tell how many were felled by the lycon, but the attack on the room slowly weakened."
0,"“Move,” Thanysa ordered her party."
0,“The lycon will not last on their own without magic support.”
0,"“Call for the second team,” Byurk hollered up the tunnel to his soldier."
0,"He did not hear a reply, but a short time later the second party of lycon jumped down from the tunnel and rushed out the room."
0,"There should have only been about twenty more, but no less than fifty followed."
0,The largest force was supposed to be in battle at the cave entrance.
0,"If the numbers there had not decreased unknown to him, then there may have been many more lycon than those who resided with them at camp."
0,"Once the second party left to aid those already fighting in the ruin caves, Byurk was left alone in the room, struggling to hold their most advantageous entrance and exit intact."
0,He lacked the ven to dig another tunnel.
0,"Should it be compromised, their only ways out were through the battle at the entrance or through the vents."
0,"The vents were too narrow for most, and the fighting at the entrance was sure to be great and terrible."
0,"Byurk knew that should he fail in his role, most of those involved in the rescue and subjugation would not be able to escape."
0,* * *
1,"Justin propped himself up, legs spread against the sides of the ventilation shaft."
0,The shaft was angled just steep enough that he could not simply rest on the slope.
0,Five slim lycon stood below him just above the vent’s opening into the ruin cave system below.
0,"They discussed between each other in their own language, but Justin could not make reason about any of it."
0,"From their gesticulations, he assumed they were thinking about jumping down before Zose arrived to give them the signal."
0,"Zose was late, and if something held him up at any of the chain of signals he was tasked with passing, unforeseen trouble was likely the cause."
0,"Justin hoped that Zose would appear with the news that Ceil was safely extracted, but extraction or not, Justin was still committed to his role of support in the confrontation against the Chimera."
0,"Whether Ceil was alive or dead, he would fight."
0,His party was separate from the rescue party.
0,"With that in mind, they did not need to wait for Zose."
1,The lycon below jumped down into the cavern.
0,Justin had little choice but to follow their lead because there were many more just above him in a long line through the shaft up to the surface.
0,"Justin was at the front in case the Chimera appeared immediately, but the cave was empty and dark."
0,"There were no Lurr that he could see, but there was a sound."
0,"Justin could not tell where it came from, but it sounded like a woman crying."
0,Perhaps that was why the Lycon decided to jump down.
0,"He could not hear it from up in the vent, but they could."
0,"“Ceil,” one of the lycon asked Justin."
0,"“No,” he replied."
0,"The voice was female, but it was too deep to be Ceil’s."
0,It was likely another victim of the Lurr.
0,"The chimera was their goal, but much to Justin’s surprise, those with him seemed intent on investigating the source of the noise."
0,"The lycon jumping down from the vent covered Justin’s back, and those with him raced to the source of the sound."
0,Justin could barely see in the light of the single small lantern carried on the hip of one of the forward lycon.
1,He turned a corner following behind the forward lycon into a large cavern.
0,Faint phosphorescent algae glowed blue in the steaming pools around the room’s perimeter.
0,In the center of the room atop a mound of moss and furs huddled a bound Mountain Elf woman.
0,Ceil was clenched tight in her arms.
0,"Justin feared that the chimera and Ceil had swapped places, that the other parties would be forced to fight not only the chimera, but all the Lurr of the lair as well."
0,"Three of the forward lycon vanished before Justin’s eyes, taking the portable light with them."
0,"Justin did not see what happened, only that they seemed at first to twitch leftward before they vanished."
0,The rotten smell of iron reached Justin’s nose.
0,He peered left and saw the remains of the three lycon splattered against the far wall.
0,"A hand grasped Justin from behind and pulled him backwards, but it was not fast enough."
0,Time slowed.
0,A long spike of bone swung from the left.
0,"It protruded from the long, multi-jointed arm of the most horrid creature Justin had ever seen, the physical manifestation of a nightmare."
0,The spike traveled inhumanly fast.
0,He could not save the two lycon in its path.
0,"Twisting his shoulder downward, Justin only just avoided the solid bone that cleaved the heads of the two lycon."
0,"Support fire from the small, arm-mounted crossbows hit their mark, allowing Justin to escape back to the room’s entrance."
0,The chimera paused for a moment as the poison began its internal assault on the chimera’s body.
0,The bolts broke from the skin like festering splinters forced from swelling flesh.
0,The swells then shrunk and healed before Justin’s eyes.
0,"The chimera, showing little emotion other than the cold will to massacre all the intruders in his lair, lunged for the center of Justin’s chest."
0,Justin had no time to think.
0,His body reacted immediately and froze time the moment the spike of the chimera’s elbow neared his chest.
0,"The entire world fell still, at first."
0,Justin felt a strange sensation he could not describe.
0,It was foreign but familiar all the same.
0,"He knew it, or at least his body recognized it."
0,The frozen impasse ended only for him and the Chimera.
0,The dripping moisture of the cave hung suspended in the air.
0,The hot puffs of breath of the lycon remained frozen in their clouds.
0,The lycon remained unblinking and unmoving.
0,Justin and the Chimera were the only life in the time-frozen world.
0,"The chimera’s cold expression changed to mild surprise, and he extracted his spike the moment it touched Justin’s chest."
0,"His long neck extended, and he examined Justin in his time-frozen world."
0,"A deep, undulating laugh escaped his three-mandibled mouth."
0,"Justin felt confident in his plan that if the chimera was so fast, he could freeze the chimera in time long enough to create the opportunity for the lycon to kill it."
0,The greatest danger of disturbing a chimera nest is not knowing the abilities of the chimera.
0,"Life magic was not outside the realm of possibility, but a complication that Justin, the lycon, Basara, Zose, Byurk, and all those of the various parties had never accounted for in their planning stood before him."
0,"Like Justin, the Chimera was a time mage."
0,Chapter 16
0,“Memories of Tragedy”
1,Ni’inca Ab’pul eyed the strange human with curiosity.
0,Many centuries had passed since he last encountered a time mage.
0,He certainly could not be of Tolmyur.
0,Those desert dwellers lost their magic proficiency when the elves culled them before their exodus.
0,"But if not Tolmyur, from where did this pale-faced human originate?"
0,Curious.
0,All the more curious due to his seemingly instant use of time magic.
0,"Had this man’s proficiency aligned with speed like Ni’inca Ab’pul, he may have been a threat, but speed was the natural enemy of those who could only slow time, since their magic meant little when their opponent could negate their effects."
0,"Perhaps Zose requested the aid of the lycon, and the lycon were emboldened by having this time mage on their side."
0,"Regrettably, they were all ill-fated in their attempt to rescue Ceil."
0,Ni’inca Ab’pul channeled his speed magic.
0,"The man reacted, having felt the unnatural ven signature, but he could do nothing to stop him."
0,"No matter how much the man slowed time in the room, Ni’inca Ab’pul could move faster still."
0,“A pity I must kill one of your ability.”
0,The channeling finished.
0,"Ni’inca Ab’pul jumped instantly to the wall left of the entrance, raised the spike of his fore-elbow, and lunged for the man."
0,"The man’s reaction felt slow, but only because Ni’inca Ab’pul’s speed was incomparable."
0,The man only managed to raise his hand to his face in futile desperation to block the strike.
0,"The moment the bone of the spike touched the flesh of the man’s hand, the man vanished."
0,"Ni’inca Ab’pul struck the ground with one hand and slid to a stop, tearing up the stone of the cavern floor."
0,"Not only was the man gone, but only two lycon remained, knocked to the ground."
0,He turned to his bedding in the middle of the cavern.
0,Both Ceil and Inym were missing.
0,"Ni’inca Ab’pul realized what had happened immediately, and it was only possible if that man could defy the laws of time magic by circumventing channeling time."
0,"In a contest of speed, one who could ignore channeling time would always be faster than one who was bound to it."
1,Justin ran behind a lycon carrying Ceil.
0,A shaking hand pushing Justin’s back urged him to move faster.
0,"Inym wanted to run as far from the chimera as possible, but in her terror, she at least had the composure to ensure her rescuers did not fall behind."
0,Justin cursed himself.
0,His plan to kill the chimera relied on the lycon’s ability to attack the chimera while it remained frozen.
0,"When Justin caught it off guard and stopped its time in that last attack, he resumed time in the cavern to allow the lycon to strike it down, but the moment any weapon made contact, both the weapon and its wielder also froze in time."
0,Nothing could be done for the two lycon who attacked the chimera.
0,"If Justin resumed time for them, he feared that the chimera would recover with them."
0,"He needed to rescue Ceil, pass her off to Thanysa’s team, and devise another plan of attack."
0,His time magic was no longer a trump card.
0,* * *
1,"The standoff at the gateway to Sen’uon remained at impasse, but the attitude of the gatekeeper was slowly, visibly changing."
0,"Basara noticed over time several Lurr on the cliffs disappear into the city or elsewhere, and they never returned."
0,"The more that were sent away, the more irritable the gatekeeper became until his stern gaze became a crimson glare focused on Basara."
0,"“I know what you are planning, maenad, and you will not be successful,” he growled."
0,“Lord Ni’inca Ab’pul will never relinquish that girl.
0,"If you truly desire the safety of Zose, you would end this misguided mission of yours."
0,He has no hope of escaping with her safely.”
0,“And yet you seem troubled.
0,Is that doubt on your mind?
0,Are you wondering why your messengers have not returned?
0,You know you cannot stop me with the numbers you have present.
0,"It is only out of goodwill that I am not fighting my way into your city,” Basara spoke frankly."
0,The gatekeeper’s glare darkened.
1,“Lycon!” a Lurr high on the rocks called.
0,"Basara did not look behind her, keeping her gaze locked on the gatekeeper, so Chloe looked in her stead."
0,“There are maybe one hundred lycon.
0,"They hold weapons,” Chloe whispered."
0,This was not part of the plan.
0,The lycon were taking independent action.
0,"“Are those yours,” the gatekeeper bellowed."
0,"“No,” Basara replied, knowing the gatekeeper would hear the truth of her words."
0,That did not mean that they were not connected.
0,Without a doubt these lycon were associated with the chimera extermination team.
0,A scream echoed from the narrow gap cleaved through the rock face behind the gatekeeper.
0,"He turned around to catch the moment when an armed lycon pounced on a fleeing woman, a civilian, and bit deep into her neck killing her."
0,Numerous metal bolts protruded from her back.
0,Lycon were already in the city.
0,“What is the meaning of this!” the gatekeeper demanded.
0,Basara did not answer.
0,She did not know.
0,The city wasn’t to be touched.
0,"She turned south to the approaching lycon in time to see them charge, firing both arrows and bolts at the Lurr on the slopes of the pass."
0,"All at once the pass was drowned in battle, and Basara did not know which side she should take."
0,"“Do not move,” Basara ordered Chloe."
0,"“Whoever attacks us first, whether lycon or Lurr, becomes our enemy.”"
0,Chloe eyed the lycon bounding up the steep slopes of the pass amid arrows and magic to reach the perched Lurr.
0,"She never once startled or frightened at the attacks flying around her, much to Basara’s surprise."
0,This young woman had a rigid mettle only seen in one who had experienced many arduous battles.
0,"“The Mountain Elf is moving,” Chloe warned."
0,"And situational awareness, Basara thought."
0,"The gatekeeper was only in her peripheral, and yet she noticed at the same time Basara had."
0,Basara became a hunter mercenary out of necessity for her survival at just under a year old after killing her mother.
0,"After a grueling year had passed and she was about the age Chloe was now, she was not even half the warrior Chloe appeared to be."
0,"The sprites stated Chloe was vital for the survival of the future, and Basara was starting to see why."
0,"Given another year, Chloe would become a warrior of unmatched caliber."
0,“The gatekeeper has made his decision.
0,"He noticed the lycon are avoiding us,” Basara whispered."
0,“Bathe the road around us in your flame.
0,"He might withstand mine, but he certainly will not withstand yours.”"
0,"For the first time, Chloe hesitated."
0,“You cannot burn me.
0,I am flame.
0,Do it now!” Basara ordered.
0,The gatekeeper charged.
0,"Viscous fire grew in Chloe’s hands, and she thrust it at her feet."
0,"Instead of an explosion, the fire spread like oil clinging to the road."
0,The rapidly charging Lurr did not fear the flame.
0,"Fire or not, injured or not, he would plow through them."
0,"Basara swiped at the flames at her feet, gathering it like a loose cloth."
0,"With a swing of her arm, a ribbon of flame latched onto the charging Lurr, and there she detonated it."
0,Fire engulfed the gatekeeper.
0,"Bound in flame, Basara pulled the gatekeeper with the fire over their heads."
0,"He tumbled across the ground behind them, rolling over Chloe’s fire."
0,He roared and writhed but was soon reduced to a flaming husk.
0,"“The lycon are losing,” Chloe said, looking above."
0,One hundred or fewer lycon could not contest against the number of Lurr guarding the pass.
0,Basara knew it was a diversion force.
0,"The lycon that entered the pass chasing after the civilian was gone, vanishing back into the city."
0,These lycon were only here to hold the Lurr at the gateway as long as was possible.
0,Basara feared what machinations the lycon devised while the Lord of Sen’uon was occupied by the extraction and extermination forces.
0,"Once again, her hand was forced."
0,"If she fought the lycon here, she would have to fight all the lycon, and doing so would endanger Zose and the Vallen party."
0,"If she did not act, the lycon at the pass would be exterminated, and the Lurr would come for her next."
0,"No matter what happened, she would have to kill the Lurr guarding Sen’uon."
0,Better now to spare what lycon she could.
0,Basara spun slowly with outstretched arms.
0,Threads of Chloe’s flame rose around her from the road.
0,She rapidly swung her hands directing them one after another into the numerous Lurr.
0,Each one touched by the thin trail of fire bloomed into flame.
0,Even those with a fire affinity succumbed to Chloe’s superior heat.
0,Chloe watched in astonishment the control of one who appeared human but was half flame elemental.
0,"In no longer than a minute, all Lurr guarding the gateway were dead."
0,Basara gathered the remaining flame on the road and launched it into the sky.
0,It burst into sparks that fizzled harmlessly into the cold wind.
0,That was the signal to all across the mountains west of Sen’uon that she was forced to eliminate the gate guard.
0,"It was the prearranged warning for the worst outcome, that all Sen’uon may now be their enemy."
0,* * *
1,Zose sped through the stone as fast as possible to the vent where Justin should have been waiting only to find it empty.
0,The party of twenty-eight lycon was nowhere near the vent opening.
0,"Unlike Ceil’s room, there were no Lurr either."
0,Zose cursed himself for choosing to take the quickest route instead of following the caves and ruin passageways.
0,"If he had, he might have spotted them either fighting or fleeing."
0,"If fortune blessed Justin’s party, perhaps they had already dispatched the chimera and were rushing back to help Thanysa’s overwhelmed rescue team."
0,"He remained motionless, silent, and listened."
0,Fortune had not favored them.
0,"Zose heard the faint and distant pulse of the chimera’s powerful heartbeat, and it was rapidly growing weaker."
0,The Chimera was on the move at haste.
0,Either it was pursuing Justin’s party or had already eliminated them.
0,The chimera was headed back towards the main hall and to the rescue team.
0,"If the Chimera met that team, they would be doomed."
0,"Zose left the stone and sprinted through the caves, ignoring the sharp pain of his only partially mended foot."
0,He could move faster on foot than in stone.
1,“Faster!” Inym screamed.
0,"Justin could hear a thundering beat approach louder and nearer, and he knew it belonged to the Chimera."
0,"When they infiltrated the lair, the Chimera never made such a sound, hiding silently, but now he was on the hunt, and Justin was his target."
0,“Ceil!” Justin called to the lycon ahead of him.
0,"Ceil was conscious, but she did not react to his voice, nor the jarring haste of their flight, nor the drumming beat that would soon be upon them."
0,She could not aid their rescue.
1,A thunderous pulse hit Justin’s back not muffled by stone.
0,He turned to see a pair of red rings in the distant dark.
0,"“Go,” he ordered, pushing Inym in front of him and allowing the remaining eight lycon to pass."
0,He had no time to think or formulate a plan.
0,"The very moment he stood alone in the dark of the cave, a stone spike appeared from the ground aimed at his chest."
0,"Time stopped, and yet the spike still moved with the speed of a swift jab."
0,"Justin twisted to the side just enough for the spike to only snag his leather breastplate, pulling him with it."
0,"The leather tore, pinning him with it to the rough volcanic stone."
0,Justin could only shield his head from the impact that felt as if he had been hit by a car.
0,"The chimera, moving at what could be perceived as a normal speed in this time-frozen world, ignored Justin and continued on after Ceil."
0,"If Justin could only touch the chimera, he could temporarily freeze it again, and the chimera knew this."
0,"“Damn it,” Justin cursed as he fought to free himself from his armor to chase after the chimera."
0,"Ceil would soon reach the main hall, and in that large room the chimera would have full range of movement, no longer restricted to the tight confines of the caves."
0,"The lycon would be eliminated swiftly, and no doubt the rescue party would soon follow."
0,"“Not again,” Justin screamed."
0,He promised himself that he would never fail to save someone ever again.
0,He would not fail to rescue Ceil.
0,"Free from his breastplate, he made chase, knowing well that he would not catch up in time."
1,Inym heard the chimera’s pulsing heart quiet for only a moment.
0,Justin had failed to even slow him down.
0,"“Left,” she ordered the lycon just as they were about to follow the wider cave straight ahead."
0,"She remembered the route she was dragged, and the shortest path to the hall was left through a narrower pass, one that the Lurr used but the chimera would not fit."
0,The lycon carrying Ceil did not question Inym’s order and followed her down the narrower ruin passage.
0,"They were able to enter the moment the Chimera arrived, but the chimera’s long, multi-jointed arm reached in and caught three lycon, dragging them back out into the cave."
0,He thrust them aside to splatter against the cavern wall.
0,"Inym thought they were safe just outside the chimera’s reach and urged the lycon on, but an orange glow behind her drew her back."
0,The elongated neck of the chimera stretching as far as it could into the passage glimmered like embers.
0,His three mandibles parted.
0,"Only now did she realize that his strange, lanky form was because he was part dragon."
0,He wouldn’t blow fire.
0,"Ceil is here, she thought, but she could see the yellow glow deep within the chimera’s maw."
0,Inym stood as a shield against the fleeing lycon as a swirling fire engulfed the passage.
0,"She could not compete flame against flame as weak as she was, especially against a monster of such power."
0,"Instead, she rapidly dropped the temperature of the fire that reached her, regulating the heat to the best of her ability."
0,She stood firm against the flame with her own fire affinity.
0,"She hoped the weakened flames that passed her would only singe ceil, not kill her."
0,"After the flames passed, she looked behind her and saw that the fire stopped at the final lycon carrying Ceil."
0,The others had not endured the heat and flailed their enflamed bodies at the steaming walls of the passage.
0,"The final lycon hurried deeper, the leather on his back smoldering."
0,Inym followed.
0,"The beat of the chimera’s heart reverberated through the stone, and Inym did not know where he was or how soon she would encounter him again."
0,She did not know the layout of this side of the ruins.
0,She only knew the large hall was close.
0,They exited the narrow corridor back into a wide cave tunnel that veered right.
0,The entryway to the large hall was located just after the turn.
0,"Inym urged the lycon to move faster, but even with his burns, he still ran faster than Inym."
0,"Right as they passed the turn, the earth rumbled."
0,A stone wall rose from the ground before Inym could see through to the grand hall.
0,She silently cursed the chimera.
0,"She did not have an earth affinity, and lycon could not use magic."
0,She thought of every excuse she could use to spare herself from the anger of the chimera.
0,She had told the Lurr that she would not aid in Ceil’s rescue or pick a side.
0,She could tell him that she feared for Ceil’s life and only aided the rescue party to protect her.
0,She could tell him that she was only following Ceil because of her agreement.
0,"If none of that worked, she could tell him that because the rescue failed, she is still the only person he had who can take care of Ceil."
0,The heartbeat thundered louder and louder.
0,Inym was at the end of her endurance.
0,"“Make certain she escapes,” Inym ordered the lycon."
0,She conjured the largest fireball within her power.
0,Her body ached.
0,Her head grew light.
0,"She was far too malnourished to start, and the fire ven conversion was draining what little energy her body had remaining."
0,"Before she collapsed to the ground, she threw the fireball at the stone wall, only serving to create a crumbling hole through which the lycon could crawl with Ceil."
0,Inym collapsed to the ground.
0,"A different chimera den and a different chimera, but history repeated itself the same."
0,"Inym survived once before with a shredded abdomen, but she knew she would not survive again, not once Lord Ni’inca Ab’pul reached her."
1,Thanysa hardened her shoulder to absorb the blow of a Lurr.
0,"Her body was weak, not fully recovered after her short hibernation, but the Lurr was also weakened severely from no less than eight lycon bolts protruding from his body."
0,"In addition to the numbing power, she quickly learned that the poison seized the ven in the Lurr’s body preventing them from using magic."
0,The idea that such a poison existed was terrifying.
0,"She could block the flow of ven with her martial skills, but that poison could be safely utilized from a distance when applied to projectiles fired from those small, arm-mounted bows."
0,"Against Lurr or elfkind, the lycon would easily gain the advantage despite their inability to use magic."
0,"Their apothecary skills surpassed that of the High Elves, and their craftsmanship surpassed that of her fellow Mountain Elves."
0,Lycon technology was beyond Thanysa’s comprehension.
0,"At first, her infiltration party was outnumbered ten-to-one, but slowly that number decreased to five-to-one and then to only double."
0,"Lurr were resilient and difficult to kill, so their numbers were not dropping fast."
0,The power balance shift came from the tunnel Byurk still struggled to keep open.
0,Lycon continued to pass through the tunnel from the surface.
0,"The constant increase in numbers combined with the debilitating lycon poison pushed the Lurr back, and soon Thanysa saw a tall, pointed arch entryway to a grand hall."
0,"From Zose’s explanation of the den’s layout, that hall was at the center of the caverns, and the chimera’s lair was on the other side."
0,"However, the passageway across from her was missing."
0,"A matching entryway was there, but a wall of black volcanic stone barely visible in the dark blocked the path."
0,"A flash of firelight blew a small opening in the volcanic rock, and something crawled through."
0,Thanysa strained her eyes to peer through the dark to see who or what it was.
0,"“Lady Ceil,” Benab called from behind her."
0,“A lycon is carrying Lady Ceil from the far passage!”
0,Many Lurr from the back line heard Benab’s call and turned towards the lone lycon.
0,"Thanysa wanted to curse him for his lack of forethought or experience, but at the same time, she never would have noticed Ceil was there if he had not called."
0,“Push forward!
0,Form a wedge!
0,We must get through!” she called.
0,Lycon in the back line focused their fire on the Lurr blocking the entrance to the grand hall.
0,"Thanysa kept point, brandishing curved stone blades to cut through the weakened Lurr."
0,"The more Lurr that fell, the more that amassed at the entrance."
0,"The numbers in the back thinned as many rushed for the lycon carrying Ceil, allowing Thanysa, Benab, and a few lycon to break through."
0,The lycon holding Ceil dropped her to the ground and stood before her against the Lurr.
0,Thanysa knew she would not reach them in time.
0,"All at once the wall of volcanic stone burst outward to the sides, the debris splitting to avoid the lycon and Ceil."
0,"Standing in the broken archway was Lord Ni’inca Ab’pul with one long, double-jointed arm grasping the top of the crumbling arch and the other hesitating to reach for Ceil or strike down the lycon crouching over her to protect her."
0,Dread filled Thanysa’s heart.
0,The subjugation party had failed.
0,"They found Ceil, but only one lycon remained."
0,"Justin and Zose were gone, possibly felled by the monster."
0,* * *
1,"Ceil sat alone in her own personal, secluded balcony seat watching a play performed on a distant stage down below, a play in which she had little interest."
0,It was a time-worn piece about a band of heroes rescuing some captive empress from an ageless horror.
0,"These stories were always tragedies, and so she knew how it would end."
0,"Eydis had once invited her to one such performance shortly after Ceil first arrive at the Amelian palace, and in her youth she was enthralled by the masterful storytelling and extravagant acting."
0,"The props and stage decorations were beautiful to behold, grandeur painstakingly crafted for a play performed before the Amelian royalty, minus the emperor who was elsewhere."
0,"But at the end, Ceil’s heart was crushed watching the heroes ultimately fail."
0,"She cried in Eydis’s arms that evening as Eydis apologized, not realizing at the time that Ceil felt captured and imprisoned in the palace, and that watching the rescue fail and the empress die in captivity would cause such emotional pain."
0,"Once Ceil had calmed, Eydis promised to talk to her father, Emperor Yuro, and demand Ceil be released."
0,"Of course, that too failed."
0,"Unlike that play so long ago, the one she now watched was a farce, poorly scripted and without endearing actors."
0,The empress had no redeeming qualities that would make a spectator desire her rescue.
0,"She was dull and pessimistic, a defeatist."
0,The empress was only being rescued because of her position and nothing else.
0,"If Ceil had to pick, she preferred Dyson’s emotive storytelling by the campfire."
0,The way he played with the flames was mesmerizing and did not lack compared to any royal play.
0,"Ceil’s heart sank in a painful ache remembering how Dyson died because of her, just like so many before him."
0,"In the end, he was just another name to add to an impossibly long list that was growing ever longer."
0,"She watched the stage with weary eyes as the chimera ignored the empress and charged the heroes with impossible speed unhindered by the numerous poisoned barbs and magic fired at him, killing many of them with a single swipe of his long arm."
0,They would meet the same tragic fate as those heroes from the time-worn stories.
0,She watched the chimera spring over the rescue party to the far entryway.
0,"His thin but powerful, whip-like tail slapped the ground, raising a wall of stone in the passage that crushed two high elves and a few lycon between the stone."
0,"Those remaining in the hall spread out and continued their attacks, trying in futile desperation to react to the chimera’s impossible speed."
0,Another wide swing of his arm cleaved three dispersed lycon in half.
0,"Amid the destruction, Ceil felt hands on her arms, back, and legs."
0,"She felt a new rope, less crude than the one with which she was formerly bound, wind around her."
0,Her hands gripped the railing of the balcony.
0,Something unexpected happened.
0,Four lycon had rappelled along the wall from the ceiling of the grand hall unknown to the master of the hall.
0,They readied to hoist the captive empress up and out to freedom.
0,"For the first time in the unknown days since Ceil had been watching this play, she grew mildly attentive."
0,"Unlike the past tragedies, they just might succeed so long as the chimera remained blinded by his slaughter."
0,"As soon as the empress first rose into the air, the chimera noticed."
0,He had been monitoring her through the stone of the hall’s floor.
1,"As he was about to attack, raucous cries bellowed from the main entrance to the hall."
0,"Lycon swarmed into the hall, a hundred at least."
0,"Intermixed were five or six Tolmyur soldiers, causing no shortage of confusion in Ceil’s mind."
0,She leaned toward the balcony railing as what she once thought was a dull and lifeless play became a bit more perplexing.
0,"She expected the lycon allied with Tolmyur to fight those allied with Vallen, but they joined together to fight the chimera, spriggan beside human."
0,"One lone Mountain Elf ran to the closed passage to reopen it, allowing more into the hall."
0,"Ceil watched as she rose higher into the air, moving for the first time in days to lean into the taught rope to better view the assault as if she was leaning over the balcony railing."
0,Magic of fire and wind assaulted the chimera but grazed off without harm as if his leathery skin was like dragon scales.
0,Innumerable poisoned bolts pelted and penetrated the skin but were pushed out as fast as they entered.
0,Every sweep of the chimera’s tail sent out a flurry of stone spikes penetrating through multiple bodies in line.
0,Every swipe of his arms cleaved flesh and splattered remains against the walls.
0,"When the chimera breathed a massive column of flame from his snaking throat, filling the floor of the hall in fire, Ceil sat back in her balcony chair."
0,The timeless horror could not be harmed.
0,He could not be killed.
0,"When the chimera took but a moment to lunge to the ceiling to snag the rope and pull Ceil away, she once again stopped paying attention."
0,She felt the rush of the air as she swung and was placed gently atop the mantel of one of the large windows that once bore a powerful furnace’s flame at the back of the hall beside the corridor to the council room.
0,"As she thought, there would be no victory here."
0,This would be a tragedy like all the others.
1,“You look bored.”
0,Ceil looked beside her to find a second seat in the formerly empty balcony.
0,"Sammy sat there watching the play, but Ceil did not startle, nor did she think it odd Sammy was there."
0,"Ceil felt dead, and so she did not question seeing someone she knew was dead."
0,"“Don’t like the show?” Sammy smirked and leaned into the railing, resting her chin on her folded arms."
0,“It’s just getting good.”
0,Ceil did not answer.
0,"Sammy was from another world, so perhaps such performances were new to her."
0,She did not know it would end in tragedy.
0,"“My favorite part is about to start,” Sammy said, confusing Ceil."
0,There was no way Sammy had seen this play before.
0,Sammy peered over her shoulder at Ceil and nudged her chin down towards the stage.
0,Ceil begrudgingly sat up on the window’s mantel to watch the massacre.
0,Immediately she noticed Zose phase through the crumbling passageway that led to the chimera’s lair.
0,He reached his hand into the small opening in the volcanic stone and pulled Justin through.
0,"Ceil thought she heard his voice when the lycon fled with her from the lair, but she was slouching in her seat at the time, not watching the stage."
0,"She doubted her ears more than her reason, because she knew Justin could not have escaped Tolmyur’s armies in Revlan."
0,He was a human from another world known personally by the Tolmyur commander.
0,"Justin had no feasible way to survive that battle, unless once Sammy died, he used his time magic to flee for his own life, leaving everyone else to die."
0,That very thought made Ceil’s arms tense with anger.
0,"“He did not run away,” Sammy replied, knowing Ceil’s thoughts."
0,She watched Justin with an endearing smile.
0,“He’s not that kind of person.”
0,“What does it matter?
0,"They are all going to die,” Ceil retorted, but Sammy smiled ever brighter."
0,"“Maybe, from how things look.”"
0,"Sammy turned back to the stage to watch the performance, so Ceil’s gaze followed."
0,"The lycon pouring in from the hall’s main entrance were mildly disoriented, but they replenished the lycons’ numbers at about the rate that the chimera felled them."
0,"Throughout the massacre, Justin tried and tried again to approach the monster, but each time the chimera avoided him."
0,"The chimera breathed fire or attacked with spikes of stone, but Justin’s impossible reflexes kept him safe."
0,"The chimera never once tried to touch him, which Ceil felt odd."
0,"Justin did not have the Aspect of Death about him, so what did the Chimera fear?"
0,"A dim flicker of hope lit in Ceil’s numbed heart, but she quickly extinguished it before it could grow and hurt her further."
0,"Numbness prevented pain, and she was tired of hurting."
0,Sammy watched her with pity for a moment but then returned to watching Justin.
0,"Noticing that the chimera actively avoided him, Justin changed tactics and weaved through the massacre for Ceil."
0,The chimera did not want to be frozen in time again.
0,"Using that fear to his advantage, perhaps he was the only one who could safely reach Ceil."
0,"If not, it should at least force the chimera to focus on him, both sparing the lycon and the few elves that remained from slaughter as well as giving him a chance to make use of his time magic."
0,"If he could freeze the chimera in time long enough for Ceil to be extracted, they won."
0,But then what?
1,"Once Justin reached the wall just below Ceil, he realized the futility of it all."
0,He could not kill the Chimera with his time magic.
0,The lycon could not kill the chimera even when frozen in time.
0,"If he managed to freeze it in time, once that time ran out, the chimera would escape and continue pursuing Ceil to reclaim her."
0,"No matter where Zose or the lycon took her, they could not escape."
0,"“Ceil!” Justin called, but she neither answered nor moved from the mantel."
0,His shout only served to draw the chimera’s attention to him.
0,Red embers glowed in its maw.
0,Justin stood in the corner of the hall with nowhere to flee the flames.
0,Only now did he realize his foolishness.
0,"In the center of the hall, he had room to utilize his time magic to maneuver and avoid the Chimera’s ranged attacks."
0,"The chimera placed Ceil in the corner of the hall, hoping Justin would pursue her."
0,A cloud of mist formed before the glowing maw and conjured a powerful geyser that shot water deep down the chimera’s throat.
0,Water hit flame and erupted into steam out of the chimera’s mouth.
0,His throat swelled and ruptured from the inside.
0,“Have none of you fought a dragon before?” Byurk hollered.
0,"If he was in the fight, it either meant that their exit was compromised or he felt it secure enough to join."
0,Justin hoped it was the latter.
0,The high-pressure steam twisted the chimera’s head and long neck away from Justin.
0,The chimera flailed for only a moment before the rupture healed and he returned to health once more.
0,"As Justin thought, the chimera was unkillable."
0,Justin scrambled quickly to climb the aged stone of the wall to reach Ceil as the Chimera changed target to Byurk.
0,Stone rose below Justin’s feet and sprung him up to the mantel where he was just able to grab the edge.
0,"Byurk sent him to Ceil, but this did not go unnoticed by the chimera."
0,"Ni’inca Ab’pul could not touch Ceil or the time mage, but he did not have to."
0,His goal was to keep Ceil safe under his protection.
0,"The time mage did not have the power to kill him, so should he eliminate all other opposition, he could keep him captive with her."
0,"Killing him was preferable, only to remove a potential headache, but if not, the time mage could provide her both protection and care."
0,"He would have no other option, just like Inym."
0,Ceil was in a cavity without an exit.
0,He only needed to wait for the moment the man climbed in to reach Ceil.
1,Ceil watched Justin hoist himself up with strenuous effort to rest his chest and arms on the mantel as if an actor from the stage below had climbed up to her balcony seat.
0,"Sammy only watched Justin with endearment, but she did not speak, and Justin did not acknowledge her presence."
0,Of course he could not.
0,Ceil knew Sammy was dead.
0,Ceil stared in mild shock at Justin’s matured and urgent gaze.
0,"Something was different about him, and Ceil knew that the loss of Sammy was the cause."
0,"Justin acted as if he was lifting himself up to the mantel, but once he rested one knee on the stone and was about to stand, he said, “Run, quickly,” and twisted off the ledge."
0,"Ceil lunged out of her seat to the railing of her balcony to see the long, swift tail of the chimera swinging towards the stone below."
0,"The chimera tried to pull his tail back now that Justin fell into the location of impact, but the sudden motion made the end of the tail flick and impact Justin’s chest from the left."
0,There both Justin and the chimera froze with the tail’s tip as thick as Justin’s arm crushing into Justin’s ribs.
0,"Ceil released her grip on the balcony railing, her hands trembling just above the cold stone."
0,"Her eyes shot to Sammy beside her, but instead of the horror or dread she expected in Sammy’s eyes, she saw exasperation."
0,Sammy only shook her head.
0,"Ceil did not know how time magic worked, but she could tell that once time resumed, Justin would die."
0,Ceil was no longer numb; she was confused.
0,Justin owed nothing to her.
0,"If anything, he should loath her for leading Sammy to her death."
0,Why then did he risk death to create an opportunity for her to escape?
0,“Lady Ceil!” Thanysa called from below.
0,"She shouted some instruction, but Ceil did not hear it."
0,Ceil staggered back away from the edge of the balcony.
0,She could no longer hear the shouts from the heroes on the stage or the desperate attacks that tried to fell the chimera in its time-frozen state.
0,"The fear and pain she had suppressed with numbness returned with force, stronger than ever before."
0,"Her mind recalled the face of every person who died because of her, starting with the nymph mother and child in the Gallanvale; the young elf girl passed off as her by the marshal; her maid and cousin, Vera; the butchered and lifeless elderly, women, and children inside Nalain; the three elves set erect impaled by spears as a message to her; the faces of everyone she met in Revlan; of Chloe, of Sammy, then Dyson, and now Justin."
0,"Ceil stumbled back, but when she collapsed into her balcony seat, it was gone."
0,"She fell into agony and darkness, spiraled into despair, and drowned in the murky depths of her heart."
0,"She could not breathe, and all she felt was anguish."
1,There in the eternal darkness she found a form standing before her.
0,The putrid skeletal hand that often reached out from behind now extended towards her.
0,She saw the skeletal body rotting and draped in torn and spoilt fabric.
0,"His skull was affixed into remorseful gloom, and his eyes were a void that devoured all light and life."
0,"All that was death stood before her, and all that once was life now remained behind."
0,"He reached, beckoning and offering relief with a silent stare."
0,Ceil extended to grasp the outstretched hand.
0,Warm arms of flesh reached from behind Ceil and embraced her.
1,“No!” cried Sammy’s voice.
0,“Do not give in!”
0,Ceil grasped Sammy’s hand for the warmth it provided in the painful dark and found herself spun around to put death at her back once more.
0,"Sammy held her in her arms, cradling her with an arm about her back and another under her legs."
0,Ceil stared into Sammy’s crying visage.
0,"“I cannot do this anymore,” she whimpered, fighting to hold back the tears her body screamed to shed."
0,"“You do not have to do this alone,” Sammy replied."
0,“Anyone who tries to save me dies!”
0,“Then stop waiting for someone to save you.” Sammy smiled across her tear-stained cheeks.
0,“You are stronger than you know.”
0,“I cannot stop Tolmyur on my own.” Ceil turned her face away from Sammy in shame and saw again the skeletal form patiently awaiting her return.
0,She immediately buried her face back into Sammy’s shoulder.
0,“You don’t have to.
0,"You never had to,” Sammy admonished with a loving gaze."
0,“But anyone who helps me dies!” Ceil screamed again.
0,"“I cannot end this on my own, and I cannot involve anyone else."
0,What else am I to do?”
0,"“Live,” Sammy replied."
0,“Show that you will not be defeated by this.
0,"Prove to yourself and the world that no matter what happens, you can overcome it.”"
0,“Even if more people die because of me?”
0,"Sammy did not answer, but a thought crept into Ceil’s mind."
0,"If she died, then for what reason did everyone sacrifice their lives?"
0,The Tolmyur commander was right.
0,Her life bore the weight of every life lost for her name.
0,"If she died, all those lives would die with her."
0,But then how could she bear such a weight?
0,How could she live with such pain?
0,"“You can ask others for help,” Sammy replied."
0,“But who would share such a burden with me?” Ceil knew that no one cared for her because of her.
0,"They only cared for her because the position she held, Empress of the Amelian Empire, or as a means to end the war."
0,"They would not sympathize with her burden, because such was expected of all who ruled."
0,They would work beside her as she was slowly crushed under the weight.
0,"Only a single name came to Ceil’s mind, but she shook it away, denying it even if it were her last hope."
0,"“Remember when I told you how Justin and I met?” Sammy asked, knowing the hope Ceil tried to deny."
0,"“He can help you, too.”"
0,"“Justin is dead,” Ceil asserted."
0,Sammy shook her head.
0,"“If he is to help you, first you need to help him.” Tears fell anew down Sammy’s face, and her face contorted in anguish."
0,"“Please, save him."
0,Don’t let Justin die!”
0,Ceil recalled Sammy’s final request during the assault on Revlan.
0,"“If something happens to me, take care of Justin...”"
0,Ceil’s eyes opened.
0,The arms across her back and supporting her legs were not Sammy’s but Thanysa’s.
0,"Thanysa’s leather armor was blackened, brittle, and decaying from where she held Ceil."
0,Ceil struggled to loosen herself from Thanysa’s grasp and fell to the hard stone.
0,Thanysa barely had the strength to carry her.
0,Ceil quickly looked around and saw she was still in the grand hall near the exit leading to where her chamber resided.
0,"At the end of the hall, lycon swarmed the time-frozen chimera."
0,"Thanysa grasped futilely at Ceil as Ceil ran for the group, Thanysa’s blackened fingers unable to hold her back."
0,"“Let me through,” Ceil ordered."
0,The lycon who tried to hold Ceil back found her touch painful.
0,"Those who grabbed her reeled as their fur blackened, and soon they all made way."
0,"“Ceil, stop,” Thanysa called, trying to warn her that touching the chimera was dangerous."
0,Eight lycon stood frozen where their blows made contact.
0,"Ceil ignored Thanysa’s warning, not caring for the reason."
0,Ni’inca Ab’pul could not be killed by anyone but her.
0,"She latched onto the chimera’s hind leg, and her time froze."
0,Chapter 17
0,“Finding Support”
1,Zose walked through Sen’uon in the brisk morning.
0,The sun just rose enough above the surrounding peaks to shower dim light to the streets through the ever-overcast sky.
0,The city looked nothing like his memory.
0,"The Lurr who once lived peaceful lives in the many ruins were replaced by lycon, and more lycon arrived by the day."
0,The lycon purged the city at the cost of many of their own while Lord Ni’inca Ab’pul was occupied.
0,"None were spared, not even Jeddin, because the lycon did not know who were Lurr and who were not."
0,"They did not revel in their spoils of war, and many were still on edge, because the lord of the land was not dead, just frozen in time for numerous days with no sign of waking."
0,"Every lycon was ready to fight or evacuate in haste should he awaken, and the women and children had yet to be brought to the city."
0,"They did not own the land--not yet, but many were hopeful."
0,The bane of the lycon had been pacified through one human’s sacrifice.
0,Zose passed a gathering of lycon distributing provisions that had been secured from the Lurr.
0,"There was plenty within the city to sustain the current numbers for quite a while longer, but soon they would eventually need to hunt again."
0,"Many of the lycon had hoped to use the Lurr for provisions, but Chloe forbade them."
0,"She was wroth that they would attack the city, not knowing of the many generations of ire between the two races."
0,"After a massive display of Chloe’s power, the lycon agreed to show proper respect for the dead civilians and burn them upon pyres like their own fallen."
0,Chloe spent every following day in a depressed stupor.
0,"She alone remained among her companions, because no one knew what would become of Justin or Ceil."
1,Tae weaved between the lycon and approached.
0,"“Zose, Kiri wishes to speak with you.”"
0,Zose nodded and followed Tae to one of the largest and most intact ruins of the city.
0,There the Vallen party had moved camp after the battle.
0,"Kiri sat atop stuffed furs with Byurk, Thanysa, Basara, and Inym around a sunken fire pit."
0,"Thanysa’s hands and arms remained blackened, but thanks to Tyree’s treatment, the blight no longer spread."
0,"However, her limbs and grip remained weak, and she could no longer grasp a sword."
0,Zose watched as she struggled to lift a bowl of wine to her lips.
0,"“Sit,” Kiri said, offering the cushion across the pit from her."
0,Zose sat down.
0,"Given the lack of change in Ceil and the chimera over the past days, he felt he knew the topic of this meeting."
0,"“I will not return to Ib’nua,” he said before Kiri could speak."
0,"“Your commission was to take Ceil to the Afarit, and that commission is now void,” Kiri replied, proving Zose’s assumption correct."
0,"“I made the contract to Ceil with payment up front, so only Ceil can terminate it,” Zose refuted."
0,"“I am Ceil’s only remaining family, and as her guardian, I too can terminate the contract in the event that the maker of the contract is incapacitated,” Kiri replied."
0,"“So, she wasn’t lying,” Zose sighed under his breath."
0,Ceil was Vallen royalty.
0,Kiri nodded to Inym who sat to Zose’s left.
0,"Without standing, Inym shifted on her knees next to Zose, presented him a coin purse, and loosed the ties."
0,Glimmering gems filled the purse almost to bursting.
0,"Inym then pulled the ties, sat the purse before him, bowed, and returned to her seat without a word."
0,Her countenance fell guilty.
0,"“This is payment for your contract termination as well as for a new contract to take Inym with you back to Ib’nua,” Kiri explained."
0,Zose looked to Basara for an explanation.
0,"She never spoke up, so clearly she was in agreement with Kiri."
0,"She was never mentioned in the contract, so Zose knew she would remain here."
0,"“I will accept payment for termination of the contract, but it is my right to choose my contracts, and I cannot accept the terms of the new one.” Zose claimed a single gem from the purse and then returned it to Inym."
0,"Inym held the purse close with quivering hands, and her guilt grew stronger."
0,"“Zose, please,” Basara pleaded."
0,“What about you?”
0,“Return to our daughters.”
0,“My task does not involve Ceil but Jethro.
0,"So long as Ceil remains here, Jethro will inevitably come."
0,Byurk and I must persuade him to end this war.”
0,"Zose already knew Basara’s plans, but her stating it again in front of everyone made her words bear even greater weight than when they talked in private."
0,"He had already told her he would not leave, and she was hoping that discussing openly might change his mind."
0,"He loved that tenacious part of her, but for once he could not agree."
0,"She might get mad, and he had always been careful to avoid angering her, but he could endure her ire."
0,He knew she loved him too much to remain angry at him for long.
0,"He knew that she secretly desired his company, especially when confronting Jethro, not for his protection which she would never need but for the emotional support his presence would provide."
0,"At the same time, she feared for his life, and no one could predict what Jethro would do with Ceil before him."
0,“I--” Zose began.
0,Hastened steps entered the room.
0,"“The chimera is moving,” Benab called, winded from his flight."
0,"“Go,” Kiri ordered."
1,"Basara, Zose, and Thanysa followed Benab outside."
0,"The lycon were in a frenzy, many gathering weapons in preparation for another offense against the waking lord of the land."
0,The bravest of them ran with Zose to the canyon and through the caverns to the grand hall.
0,"The air of the cave was disorienting, but with sight grounding him, he recovered quickly after entering the ruins."
0,The lycon on the other hand remained unsteady on their feet for a time after entering the grand hall.
0,Lycon surrounded the back of the hall.
0,"The chimera still appeared frozen at a distance, but as Zose neared, he noticed the nearly imperceptible motions."
0,"“Remove Tyree from the hall,” Zose ordered, noticing her leaning against the side wall."
0,She was stationed here in the event that either Ceil or Justin recovered and needed treatment.
0,"Should Ni’inca Ab’pul recover, they could not risk losing her."
0,Her magic was their lifeline.
0,"Zose watched as the chimera’s body lowered ever so slowly, but at the same time, he also saw Ceil grip tighter around the leg."
0,"If Ceil also moved, then the chimera was not beating Justin’s time magic."
0,Justin’s time magic was weakening.
0,Zose looked up at where the tail pinned Justin against the wall.
0,"It too was moving, crushing deeper into Justin’s chest."
0,"He ran and dove into the wall, his head quickly appearing just beside Justin."
0,“Someone grab the tail and pull it away.
0,It will crush him.
0,Quickly!”
0,A dozen lycon built up speed and ran up the wall.
0,"When level with the tail, they jumped out, grabbing the tail as they passed."
0,"Each lycon that touched it appeared to freeze, but not entirely."
0,"They moved slowly outward, pulling the tail with them."
0,Zose expel himself from the stone sideways away from the direction the tail crushed into Justin.
0,Zose too slowed nearly to a stop as he pulled Justin with him.
0,Everyone watched as the near-imperceptible movement became more and more noticeable.
0,"At the same time, they saw the leg of the chimera Ceil grasped rot from her touch at similar pace."
0,"The chimera crouched, and the moment he lunged in slow motion to distance himself from Justin, the force of his lunge shattered his rotten leg, sending him tumbling into the crowd."
0,"The lycon pulled his tail away from Justin, and Zose fell with Justin to the ground."
0,"All at once, time resumed its normal pace for those who were once frozen."
0,"The lycon scrambled to distance themselves from the chimera and readied for battle, but the chimera did not rise."
0,The rot affecting his leg spread as his body melted.
0,Ceil looked over at Ni’inca Ab’pul and met his eyes.
0,"Whereas before her eyes were dead, now they held purpose and a deep anger."
0,Ni’inca Ab’pul’s neck extended.
0,He saw Zose calling Tyree over to Justin.
0,"His eyes then found Basara, one he knew was powerful among those in the wilderlands."
0,"“Protect her,” he pleaded to Basara."
0,“Do not let Ceil die or all is lost.”
0,"The rot spread, melting the Lord of Sen’uon, Whinhlem’s primal Lurr, into putrid slop."
0,* * *
1,Ceil was wrapped in thick fabric and rushed from the hall outside before she could ascertain Justin’s condition.
0,Benab carried her through the city into a large structure.
0,Kiri met her at the entrance and followed with Tae to a room with a pool where she could wash herself of the viscous rot of the melted chimera.
0,Only once she was sat down and left in the care of Tae who quickly stripped her did she realize that the rot faintly stung her skin.
0,"Where Tae touched it, Tae’s skin peeled and flaked into the water."
0,"“Stop,” Ceil ordered, pushing Tae’s hands away."
0,“I will clean myself.” Ceil recalled the many plants that had blackened and grew brittle at her touch.
0,She did not want the same to happen to Tae.
0,"“Ceil!” Lemi appeared from the entry, but Kiri stopped her before she could approach."
0,“Do not draw close yet.
0,"Not until she bathes,” Kiri ordered."
0,Lemi immediately noticed Tae’s hands and helped her heal them.
1,"Once Sammy finished washing, Tae approached first and grasped Ceil’s hands."
0,"They were cautious of her, and Ceil did not understand why."
0,"“She is safe to touch,” Tae announced."
0,"Lemi immediately ran for Ceil and embraced her, hugging her tight."
0,Ceil recalled the memories of her imprisonment and realized that Lemi had been there taking care of her for a time.
0,"“Thank you,” Ceil said, pulling Lemi’s head closer with her hand on Lemi’s mossy hair now barren of flowers."
0,"Tae brought Ceil warm clothing, and together with Lemi, helped Ceil dress."
1,"“Come,” Kiri ordered."
0,She led Ceil to a larger room with a fire pit adorned simply with numerous cushions and stuffed furs.
0,Thanysa was there with Basara and another emaciated troll Ceil recognized as her second caretaker.
0,Ceil immediately noticed Thanysa’s blackened arms and made the connection with Tae’s former words and why Benab wrapped her in thick fabric.
0,"For a time after Ceil had met the darkness face to face, its deathly power attacked anyone who touched her."
0,Kiri sat Ceil at the head and then sat beside her in the second position.
0,Thanysa then bowed with Inym quickly following.
0,"“I ask that you remain calm and do not speak,” Kiri said."
0,"Ceil wondered what ill news Kiri would tell, but then saw Byurk enter the room across the fire pit from her."
0,Ceil’s blood immediately boiled.
0,Her anger was soon replaced with dread.
0,She recalled the scene of a human soldier fighting beside Benab.
0,"A Tolmyur commander would never side with the fairies, especially the one tasked with their genocide, so Ceil knew immediately what had happened."
0,She knew why Justin was alive and cursed herself for not realizing it.
0,Justin was not there to save her.
0,Her delusions of Sammy were a false hope she created out of desperation.
0,"After the death of Sammy and Chloe, after Ceil fled the battle, Revlan must have struck a deal with Tolmyur to retrieve her and present her in exchange for their survival, no doubt out of necessity after many more lives were lost in battle."
0,"Dharin never would have given such an order, so he surely had died in the early stages of the final battle, leaving those who remained to choose preservation."
0,"Ceil wanted to shout out in anger and frustration, but somehow she felt calm, almost relieved."
0,This was the proper way of things.
0,She would now pay for all the lives lost for her name.
0,She lifted her head and smiled a weary smile to the enemy commander.
0,"“Welcome, Commander Byurk of the Tolmyur Kingdom,” Ceil said in proper manner, ready for the deal to be completed and for her to be handed over to the enemy."
0,"“If only things were as you assume,” Byurk said as he took his place across from Ceil, knowing well what Ceil thought given the situation."
0,“I am not here to claim you but help you.”
0,"Ceil’s smile faded, and her lips parted lightly in confusion."
0,Was this all still a delusion of her mind?
0,"Byurk bowed his face to the floor in submission, stunning Ceil further."
0,"“I give no excuse for my role in the fall of Vallen, but know that I am now a traitor to Tolmyur and am on your side until the day I must pay for my sins against your people.”"
0,"“General Byurk is our prisoner, and in exchange for a stay of his punishment, he is aiding us in your protection and ending this war,” Kiri explained."
0,"“Then Revlan…” Ceil began, hoping against hope that Byurk was a prisoner of war captured after defeating the armies of Tolmyur."
0,"“Fallen,” Kiri replied."
0,"“After purging Revlan, he led a party into the wilderlands."
0,"Chloe bested him, and Basara took him prisoner and convinced him to aid us.”"
0,"“I see…” Ceil said, but then she realized what Kiri said."
0,“Chloe is alive?
0,"“Benab should be bringing her news of your recovery,” Thanysa explained."
0,“I trust she will be here before long.”
0,"Relief welled in Ceil’s chest, and after growing accustomed to so much darkness, it was almost too painful to bear."
0,"Another thought immediately entered her mind, the other survivor of Revlan."
0,“What of Justin?”
0,Basara shook her head.
0,“Ni’inca Ab’pul’s tail crushed completely through Justin’s right lung.
0,Shards of bone tore through the other.
0,Tyree was slow reaching him in the chaos after his time magic ended.
0,"She is treating him, but she does not expect he will survive.”"
0,Ceil’s painful relief over Chloe immediately vanished back into the comfortable darkness.
0,"She felt tears well in her eyes, but she gripped her fists tight and held them back."
0,Sammy was not even there for Ceil to apologize.
0,At least now Sammy and Justin could be together in death.
0,Kiri began explaining what had happened from the time they fled Revlan.
0,"During the long tale, Chloe appeared with Benab and nearly tackled Ceil to the ground in her heavy embrace, sobbing uncontrollably."
0,"She remained attached to Ceil as the story continued and Ceil learned of the worst possible revelation told them by the sprites, that Jethro was also vital for surviving the approaching calamity and should not be killed."
0,* * *
1,Ceil waited anxiously for three days to hear news of Justin’s death or recovery.
0,"On the fourth day, Lemi visited with a radiant smile and announced that Justin would recover."
0,"His right lung could not be saved, and several of his ribs could not be healed and had to be removed, but his life was no longer in danger."
0,Ceil did not breathe a sigh of relief nor did she share in Lemi’s excitement.
0,"She hung her head, part of her hoping that he could have been reunited with Sammy."
0,"“What’s wrong,” Lemi asked, sitting on a cushion covered in soft underbelly fur beside Ceil."
0,"She crossed her legs, leaned down, and looked up into Ceil’s eyes."
0,"“It is nothing,” Ceil lied."
0,“Is he awake?”
0,"“No,” Lemi said."
0,She reached her arm over and pulled Ceil close so they could rest against each other.
0,"“Tyree couldn’t give a time, and she did not want to force him to wake."
0,"Zose said he will wait until Justin wakes before taking you to the Afarit, that way you can talk to him."
0,Both he and Kiri do not think it’s safe for him to travel.”
0,"“I see…” Whatever calamity that is supposed to happen involved Justin, and if the road to the Afarit was dangerous, Justin should remain behind."
0,Surely the lycon would look after him until she returns bearing whatever good or ill news from speaking to Bydrofe.
0,"After coming so far, Ceil wondered if there was a reason to continue on and speak to Bydrofe."
0,"With both Basara and Byurk present, and under the protection of the lycon, they could remain here in Sen’uon until Jethro arrived."
0,"According to Basara and Byurk, Jethro would never harm a lycon."
0,"“I must speak with Zose,” Ceil said, rising to her feet."
0,Her legs were weak after sitting for most that day and the three previous.
0,She had to know why neither Zose nor Basara had considered this option.
1,Ceil found them downstairs around the fire pit.
0,Chloe was there with Benab eating dinner.
0,The day had grown late without Ceil realizing.
0,"“Want some?” Chloe asked, holding out her earthenware plate of dried meat."
0,Ceil grabbed a single strip and sat down.
0,Chloe then returned to talking with Benab.
0,"Her Elven had improved tremendously, although her understanding of the grammar was still that of a very young child."
0,"“Zose, Basara, I have something to ask,” Ceil said after sitting beside Chloe."
0,Lemi then sat on the other side of Ceil.
0,"“Ask away,” Zose said with a smirk."
0,“Can we not remain here in Sen’uon and wait for Jethro?”
0,"“No,” Zose replied immediately."
0,"“Or, I should be more specific."
0,You cannot remain here.”
0,“What do you mean?”
0,"“Not all the lycon are of the same opinion of you,” Basara explained."
0,"“While many view you as a hero, others are wary."
0,"What you did to Ni’inca Ab’pul frightened many, and those who tried to prevent you from initially touching him have already died.”"
0,Ceil’s heart sank.
0,She had directly killed those who tried to rescue her.
0,"No, not rescue; they were there to kill the chimera, not save her."
0,"While she was the reason for the mission undertaken by Byurk and Thanysa, for the lycon she was only collateral."
0,But why was Thanysa spared if her touch killed the lycon?
0,"Thinking it over, she held no ill feelings towards Thanysa, but she did towards the lycon due to the one who abducted and injured her in the burster."
0,"“Do not misunderstand,” Zose said."
0,"“They are grateful for what you did, extremely grateful, but with their women and children arriving every day to settle Sen’uon, they fear what harm you may cause them."
0,They requested that I continue with you north where you will be better protected by the Afarit’s numbers and terrain but have allowed us to wait until Justin recovers.”
0,"“Until Justin recovers, then?”"
0,"“Until Justin recovers,” Zose repeated back."
1,Justin slept for eight more days.
0,"Chloe arrived this time with Benab to retrieve Ceil, and together they walked to a building across the wide road where Tyree had set up a hospital for all the injured from the battle and the lycon who arrived in Sen’uon."
0,"The entryway by the roadside was crowded with lycon, but they quickly parted as Ceil approached, many fearing to draw too close."
0,Lemi stood with Coby inside to prevent any lycon without business from entering.
0,"“He’s in the single room upstairs,” Chloe said."
0,“You are not coming?” Ceil asked.
0,"“Lemi and I have already spoken with him, and I think you might have a few things you want to talk about with him in private.”"
0,"Sammy, Ceil realized."
0,She hugged Chloe and scratched at the feathers on the side of Coby’s head as she passed.
0,Six braziers sat elevated in the spacious main floor that may have been a large tavern or similar originally.
0,Ceil kept to the wall and away from the many lycon sitting and laying on blankets.
0,The lycon did not appear to have battle wounds.
0,Most were sick or frostbitten from their travels.
0,Those injured from the chimera subjugation and purging of the city were long finished with their treatment.
0,A single slanted stairway in the back led to the second floor.
0,There Tyree welcomed her and excused herself back down to the first floor using Tae as a crutch.
1,Justin’s room was not much smaller than Ceil’s but far more furnished.
0,The furs and blankets that lined the floors and walls to give the cold stone some warmth were not the same craft as those Ceil recalled from her imprisonment or found in the structure where the Vallen party resided.
0,"They were all clearly of lycon make, gifts for Justin."
0,"Ceil had struck the finishing blow on the chimera, and yet the Lycon seemed to view Justin as the hero, but she could not complain."
0,Justin noticed Ceil enter and moved two cushions behind his back so he could sit up.
0,"“How are you feeling,” he asked with a tired but genuine smile."
0,"“I should ask you the same,” Ceil responded coolly as she took a seat on a coarse fur beside his bed."
0,Justin pulled back his blanket revealing a hardened leather breastplate that covered most his left breast and wrapped around on the right side to his back.
0,It was strapped to him at the shoulder and around the chest.
0,The leather was black and had a great shine.
0,The quality was exquisite and matched the shape of Justin’s chest as if no damage had been done.
0,"It was not unlike lycon armor, and no doubt they crafted it for him."
0,"Ceil hesitated to ask what the damage looked like underneath, so Justin worked to loosen the straps before she could."
0,"When he peeled off the leather, a cavity remained where his right breast once had been."
0,"He had no ribs or muscle from his sternum until near his back, aside from the topmost two ribs."
0,Freshly pink and scarless skin covered what little flesh remained inside.
0,It pulsed lightly with his heartbeat and swelled a little with each breath that pulled air into his remaining lung.
0,"“Looks worse than it is,” Justin admitted with a smile."
0,“The cavity should fill with fluid in time.
0,I feel a little lopsided and can’t lift my right arm yet.
0,"Breathing is hard, but otherwise, Tyree did a good job patching me back together."
0,"I want to say that medical technology on Earth is better because I’m sure they could have created prosthetic ribs or something so that I still look like a normal person, but then again doctors on Earth could never have saved me in the first place."
0,Life magic is amazing.
0,Were you hurt at all in the battle?”
0,"“No…” Ceil said, now finding speech difficult after seeing the extent of the injury Justin took for her sake."
0,"She shook her head slowly, now starting to understand what Sammy saw in this self-sacrificing fool, but his kindness irritated her."
0,“You never should have been injured.
0,You should have let me be.
0,"I have never once shown you kindness, so you had no right to sacrifice yourself for my sake.” If Justin saw her as some empress of a fallen empire like everyone else, she could justify his sacrifice, but she knew he did not view her in that manner."
0,"He saw her as a person, and that made his injury all the more difficult for her to bear."
0,Justin chuckled.
0,“You sound just like Sammy.”
0,"“Never compare me to Sammy!” Ceil shouted, Justin’s words tipping her irritation over its fragile edge."
0,“I’m nothing like her!
0,"I could never amount to the person she was.” Ceil gripped her sleeves with white knuckles, fighting to hold back her emotions."
0,"“Sorry,” Justin apologized quickly."
0,“I did not mean it that way.
0,"She was amazing, wasn’t she?"
0,You could never find a better person if you tried.
0,"At least, I wouldn’t think so.”"
0,"Ceil’s grip relaxed, and she stared blankly at the cushions on the other side of Justin’s bed, deep within her memories of Sammy."
0,"The time she knew her was so short, but Sammy had made such a strong impression on her, just as powerful as Eydis, and she loved her just as much."
0,"The corners of Ceil’s eyes began to sting, so she quickly closed them and fought back her tears with a pained expression."
0,"“You know, we have a lot of beliefs and superstitions on Earth."
0,One of them is that those we lose are not really gone but watch over us.
0,Sammy was there during your rescue.”
0,"Ceil’s eyes shot open, and she stared at Justin in disbelief."
0,Had he seen her there too?
0,Were her visions not just delusions?
0,"“You noticed as well,” Justin said with a smile."
0,"“I’m not the superstitious sort, so I try to find reasons for everything that doesn’t make sense, but, I don’t know how else to explain it other than saying she was there."
0,"Wherever she is now, she’s watching over us.”"
0,"“She would not be with me,” Ceil retorted, rejecting what she saw in her darkest moments."
0,“She loved you more than anything.
0,"If she could return, she would be with you.”"
0,"“You know Sammy better than that,” Justin chuckled, but it was a weak chuckle like three short breaths."
0,“You were the one who needed her most back then.”
0,Ceil could not deny it.
0,"Had Sammy the opportunity, she most definitely would have been by her side, not fighting beside Justin."
0,"“I saw her,” Ceil admitted in a faint whisper."
0,“I almost fell.
0,"I almost lost myself, but she held onto me and kept me from giving up."
0,But then she left.
0,"Once you were hurt, she left.”"
0,"“Once you were safe,” Justin corrected."
0,“I saw her too.
0,I tried to hold the chimera back as long as I could.
0,"When time froze, the pain of the chimera’s tail crushing into me was constant."
0,I endured it as long as I could so that they could escape with you as far away as possible.
0,"I almost lost focus immediately, but then Sammy held me through the pain until I couldn’t bear it anymore."
0,Turns out the one who killed the chimera was you.
0,I never saw that coming.”
0,"“Sammy begged me to save you,” Ceil said, wiping a tear before it could fall."
0,"She fought even harder to hold back her tears, her frustration at her emotions showing on her face."
0,"“She said you could help me, like you helped her…."
0,I am tired.
0,"I feel like I cannot go on,” Ceil admitted."
0,She was angry at herself both for her weakness and because Justin was the first person she let hear that weakness.
0,“I cannot do this anymore!
0,Why did such a fate fall to me?
0,Why am I forced to carry a burden heavier than I could ever bear?
0,Am I supposed to live in pain and suffering all my life?”
0,"“Things will get better,” Justin said with a weak but reassuring smile."
0,“How?!
0,When?!” 
0,Ceil looked Justin in the eyes not caring to hide the anguish on her face.
0,She could not see any happiness in her future.
0,She could not see an end to her suffering.
0,"Even if the discussion between Jethro, Basara, and Byurk ended the war, the guilt of all the destruction caused by her own existence would bear down on her forever."
0,"She would never be free, and she could not see any way to break those chains herself."
0,"Ceil’s thoughts dwelt on Sammy’s final request, on every story Sammy told about Justin."
0,"She was desperate, and Sammy revealed the only thread of hope she thought she could grasp."
0,"“You say the future will be better.” Ceil’s lips quivered, and she struggle to speak her next words."
0,“Can you create such a future for me?
0,Can you promise to bring me happiness?”
0,"“No,” Justin replied immediately."
0,Ceil’s anguished face froze.
0,Her hands did not rise to wipe the tears that drew lines down the sides of her nose.
0,"She had gathered every grain of courage she had left to speak those words, but by a single word from Justin, her last thread of hope snapped."
0,“I cannot be that for you.
0,I will only hurt you.
0,"Everyone I have ever cared about, every girl I have ever loved, has either been hurt or has died because of me."
0,I do not want that to happen to you.”
0,Ceil looked up from the bed into Justin’s caring but remorseful eyes.
0,For the first time she realized that perhaps Justin bore a similar pain.
0,"Ceil had suffered from all the lives lost because of her, but she had never lost a lover."
0,Sammy was not the first he lost.
0,"There were others, and he blamed himself for each one."
0,"He had lived with all this pain and regret, and yet he remained optimistic for the future of others."
0,Ceil gritted her teeth.
0,She felt even worse now that she spilled the hidden pains of her heart upon him as if what he suffered did not matter.
0,She hated herself for asking him to provide her a bright future when he had still not found his own.
0,"“I am sorry that I bothered you.” Ceil shifted her legs to the side to stand, but Justin grasped her hand."
0,"“I cannot be that for you, and I cannot promise to give you happiness."
0,"What I can promise is that I will do everything in my power to help you through this, so you can find your own happiness.”"
0,“Stop waiting for someone to save you.”
0,"Ceil’s hand fell slack, and she slumped back down on her fur."
0,"She had waited and waited, but she was waiting for the wrong salvation, and so she never found it."
0,She did not need a hero to save her.
0,She did not need a lover to provide happiness for her.
0,"It was clear to her now that what she needed most was a friend willing to share in her burden to make it lighter to bear, but she never let anyone in close enough to share in that burden even if they were more than willing."
0,That was what Sammy meant.
0,"Sammy had tried again and again to be Ceil’s support, but Ceil never peeled away the armor she had built around herself and let in Sammy’s warmth."
0,"Now, more than ever, she missed Sammy."
0,She missed Eydis.
0,"She missed her childhood friend, Linoa."
0,"She missed her mother, Arlen."
0,Every shoulder she had ever cried on was gone.
0,"“I don’t know what you have been told or what you have convinced yourself to believe, but it’s okay to cry,” Justin said."
0,Ceil did not know what manner of face she made that would cause such a flow of tears from Justin’s eyes.
0,"His arm was extended, welcoming her."
0,Ceil curled her arms to her chest and slowly leaned into Justin.
0,He wrapped his arm around her and let her release all the pain she had suppressed in the dark recesses of her broken heart.
0,"All the while Justin spoke nothing, only shedding tears with her."
0,Chloe held Lemi back at the stairs.
0,"The girl wanted to join Ceil and Justin, especially after she heard the silent and strained cries of one who had been long afraid to let her emotions show no matter how deep the pain, but Chloe could not let her."
0,She held Lemi in a light embrace as tears slowly fell from her own eyes.
0,"Both Ceil and Justin needed this moment, a mutual understanding between two friends who had lost everyone they had ever loved."
0,* * *
1,The next day.
0,"Thanks to Tyree’s treatment, Justin had little issue walking and could manage his daily needs on his own."
0,"He had always grown tired rather quickly, but missing a lung, he also became winded after only a little exertion."
0,"Tyree promised that with enough training, he should find little difference between having one lung or two, but he would have to work diligently, considering Justin was never all that fit to begin with."
0,"With this knowledge, Justin demanded that he join Ceil’s party heading north."
0,Kiri agreed only if Justin could receive Thanysa’s approval.
0,Ceil and Chloe watched Justin drill endurance exercises under Thanysa’s instruction.
0,"Lemi was there as well, but she was preoccupied playing with Coby."
0,"Chloe could only smile at Justin’s pathetic state, but Ceil was determined to bring Justin along."
0,"“Get up,” Ceil ordered when Justin collapsed to his knees, too winded to stand."
0,“It is time for you to stop relying on your time magic to get you through every hardship.” This new hurdle was one Justin’s time magic would not surmount.
0,"After Justin collapsed again, Thanysa called for a break."
0,Ceil ran over to Justin who lay flat on his back.
0,“Do not lie down.
0,"Stand and breathe,” Ceil advised, reaching a hand to Justin to pull him to his feet."
0,“Kiri gave you two days.
0,You need to do much better than what you are showing now.”
0,"“I am not… going to…” Justin turned his head aside and hacked out mucus from his throat, “…recover… that fast.”"
0,“Thanysa is not looking for you to be back to normal in two days.
0,That would be impossible.
0,She is measuring your limits and deciding if you will become a liability.
0,"Eydis trained you, right?"
0,Did she ever mention motion control?”
0,"“Remove unnecessary movements,” Justin realized."
0,"“Pace yourself,” Ceil added."
0,“You become a liability if you collapse.
0,"Do that too much, and Thanysa will never give you permission."
0,"If you feel yourself struggling for breath, slow down."
0,You do not need to keep pace with Thanysa.
0,That is not what she wants.”
0,"Justin looked into Ceil’s stern gaze and saw a bit of Eydis within her deep blue eyes, but he would never admit it for fear of Ceil yelling at him again."
0,"At least there was life in Ceil’s eyes again, though dim."
0,"For the rest of the session and the next day, Justin took Ceil’s advice to heart but still struggled more than he felt Thanysa would forgive."
0,Ceil continued giving him pointers she felt would help and eventually joined him in the exercises to demonstrate what she meant.
0,"On the final day, both Justin and Ceil feared that he would not receive permission."
0,"Thanysa’s final endurance test was the worst of them all, and Justin knew he would not last even following all of Ceil’s advice."
0,"The moment Justin was about to collapse, he called for Ceil."
0,She rushed in and caught his arm over her shoulder.
0,Together they finished the remainder of the test.
0,Ceil let Justin sit to rest instead of stand as she had ordered every break previously.
0,"Her expression showed defeat, that she knew Justin had failed the moment he gave in and requested her help."
0,Chloe sat on the other side of Justin and rubbed his back while Lemi worked to ease his muscle fatigue now that the final session was over.
0,Thanysa walked over and stood before them.
0,"She folded her blackened arms, a sign of her own struggle overcoming injury."
0,Justin feared what the final assessment would be.
0,"“You can join us,” Thanysa finally said."
0,Both Justin and Ceil stared at Thanysa in shock while Lemi excitedly wrapped her arms around them both and Chloe patted Justin on the shoulder.
0,"“Ceil was perceptive in what I was looking for in your training, but there was something you both missed."
0,I had full intent on failing you.
0,"Justin,” Thanysa continued, glaring down at him, “ever since we entered the wilderlands, you have secluded yourself."
0,You never accepted anyone’s company.
0,You never asked for help when you needed it.
0,"Had that mindset continued, we could not risk bringing you through far more hostile lands to the Afarit in your present state."
0,Your old self would have collapsed and forced us to bear your entire burden or split our party as some take you back to Sen’uon.
0,"After seeing you employ Ceil’s guidance yesterday, I had to push you to your breaking point today to see if you would ask for help."
0,"With Ceil’s aid, you finished the test, and that was the test."
0,"Had you not called out to one of your companions and had they not helped you, you would have failed.”"
0,"“You were testing us all,” Ceil realized."
0,"“That is why you made us watch,” Chloe added, just as surprised."
0,“Get your affairs in order.
0,We leave in two days.”
0,Chapter 18
0,“Heroes of the Lycon”
1,"On the eve before departure, the lycon held a grand feast in the largest square of Sen’uon."
0,"The elderly speaker for the lycon who had worked with Zose, Basara, and Byurk to plan the rescue and hunt now became the speaker for the heads of the seventeen lycon tribes who had migrated to Sen’uon."
0,He spoke to the feast gathering in Elven first and then repeated in the lycon tongue.
0,"In his opening address to the Vallen party who sat in the center around the largest of many glowing coal fires, he renamed the city Guthrelnin, meaning “long-desired home” in their tongue."
0,The lycon were not nomadic by choice.
0,Any attempt to settle permanently in the wilderlands was disrupted and destroyed by the Lurr.
0,"A representative from each tribe stepped forward, each a maiden of their respective tribes."
0,"They circled the Vallen party and then each knelt before a member who was present during the hunt: Byurk and three of his men who survived the combat at the cave entrance, the last remaining High Elf of those who joined from Revlan, Hethyro, Benab, Tae, Thanysa, Chloe, and Basara."
0,"Two knelt before Zose, and the remaining four knelt together before Chloe and Justin."
0,Each person who had one maiden before them was presented a whistle and clean rag with a promise of protection through the wilderlands or aid in repayment should they request it at the cost of their whistle.
0,Each recipient rubbed the rag on the nape of their necks before returning it to the maidens.
0,Zose was presented a knife and white cloth.
0,He cut light across the top of his forearm and wiped the rag along the shallow wound.
0,One of the maidens then retrieved the knife while the other held the cloth to her chest like a treasured object.
0,"“Zose, for your past service to the lycon and wisdom in bringing the tribes together united against our common enemy, your call shall never expire."
0,"If you are ever in need, the lycon will heed your call until the end of your days."
0,Only three in our history have received such honors.
0,You are the fourth.”
0,"After the announcement, the bloodied cloth was passed first between the heads of each tribe and then to all who were present at the feast."
0,The rags of the other whistle-bearers then followed.
0,"No gifts were given to Justin or Ceil, but the four lycon remained bowed before them throughout the Exchange of the Cloth."
0,"After the Exchange of the Cloth, the feast grew silent."
0,The four maidens who knelt before Justin and Ceil each took one hand in both of theirs and prompted them to stand.
0,Justin and Ceil were led before the tribe leaders and before all those present at the feast.
0,"The maidens then knelt beside Justin and Ceil, pressing the back of their hands to their snouts."
0,"The touch was soft and smooth with a hint of warmth, more like the nose of a human than that of a canine."
0,"The first leader approached Justin, lifted his right hand, and revealed what looked like a piece of dried meat."
0,The leader then raised the meat to his mouth and swallowed it.
0,"Next, he moved to Ceil, raised his left hand to reveal a short lock of hair the same color as Ceil’s, and similarly swallowed it."
0,It was then that Justin noticed Ceil’s hair was shorter by about two or three inches.
0,If the hair was Ceil’s then what was the meat?
0,"Justin realized all too quickly that it must have come from him, from what was removed during his treatment after the battle."
0,"Each lycon tribe leader in turn repeated the same ceremony, eating Justin’s flesh and Ceil’s hair."
0,"When finished, the leaders lined up in front of them and bowed."
0,All the lycon at the feast bowed with them except the speaker who stood behind.
0,“Master Ceil.
0,Master Justin.
0,Your flesh to our flesh.
0,"Where once you were elfkind and human, you are now lycon, our kin and our family."
0,"Only one other in our history has blessed our people as you have: Bydrofe , Titan of the North, Guardian of Whinhlem."
0,"In our darkest moment, Bydrofe saved us from extinction by creating a bridge across the frozen waters for us to live here on his lands."
0,"Like Bydrofe, you have saved our people from extinction at the hands of Ni’inca Ab’pul and the Lurr of the wilderlands."
0,"Just as the tale of Bydrofe has been told among our people for over two millennia and will continue to be told until the end of time, so too shall your story be told among our people, your people.”"
0,"Instead of giving Ceil and Justin a cloth for their scent, each tribe leader approached."
0,The maidens who knelt at Ceil and Justin’s side lifted Ceil and Justin’s hands.
0,Each leader touched their snout to the back of their hands and breathed deep.
0,"Once finished, every lycon family in turn approached, bowed, and then repeated the same."
0,"Ceil did not seem bothered by such ceremony, but Justin noticed that many lycon were hesitant to approach her, and while they touched their noses to the back of Justin’s hand as they drew in his scent, only a few dared to touch Ceil’s hand."
0,The speaker stood again once the procession finished.
0,"At last, two whistles were presented on incredibly soft cloth the color of lycon fur."
0,“Master Ceil.
0,Master Justin.
0,"We present you with every gift provided to the whistle-bearers this night, but we know such a debt will never balance."
0,You may dine with us.
0,You may travel with us.
0,You may live with us.
0,You may find a mate among us.
0,We will live for you.
0,We will die for you.”
0,For the first time Justin noticed Ceil’s expression darken.
0,"Too many had died for her already, and though they stated that she may live among them, Justin was told the truth, that she was leaving Sen’uon because the lycon feared her."
0,"The maidens led Ceil and Justin back to their seats, and after a howling cheer from all present, the feast began anew, now with as much strong wine as could be gathered from the spoils of Sen’uon."
0,Ceil held her bowl of wine but did not drink.
0,Her eyes gazed past it into some memory or thought.
0,Justin clasped his hand on her shoulder and rubbed it lightly.
0,"“I am fine,” Ceil said a length before taking a light sip of her wine."
0,"“I will not lie and say I am not bothered, but I also expected such discrimination.”"
0,"“Expecting it doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt,” Justin spoke for her, and Ceil nodded after a short pause."
0,"“Remember, Chloe and I am here for you whenever you want to talk."
0,No need to keep your feelings locked inside anymore.”
0,"Justin raised his bowl of wine to Ceil, and she raised hers back."
0,"He was glad that she was finally opening up, not just to him but to herself."
0,"He tried to remain light on the wine to keep Ceil company through the feast, but due to the strength of the drink, he was the first out, much to the entertainment of the others."
0,* * *
1,Ceil awoke with the first hangover of her life.
0,"Lycon after lycon approached to drink to her, and she in turn had to take a sip with them out of courtesy."
0,"She could not remember who brought her to her room, but Lemi was there with Coby when she woke."
0,"“I thought your head might hurt when you woke, so I brought some hot water and meat,” Lemi said in a quiet voice."
0,"“After you eat a little, I will help with the pain.”"
0,"“Thanks,” Ceil replied, reaching over for a strip of warm meat, so soft and tender that it nearly fell apart at her touch."
0,"Despite the melting texture, a pulse hammered at the inside of her head as she chewed."
0,“When do we leave?”
0,"“Noon, so that the coldest part of the day is behind us."
0,At least that is what Zose said.”
0,Ceil looked at Lemi sitting in front of her holding Ceil’s steaming goblet of water and Coby beside her begging for some of the meat.
0,Ceil tore a piece and held it out for Coby.
0,“Has Zose told you what the Afarit is like?”
0,"“No, but I have an idea,” Lemi admitted."
0,“Then you know that you cannot come with us.”
0,“I’m going with!” Lemi protested.
0,“The Afarit is a fire waste.
0,"One accident or misstep and you will die,” Ceil explained without any force or anger in her voice."
0,“I’ve come with you all this way.
0,I don’t want to go back now.
0,Tyree and Tae are going.”
0,"“Lemi,” Ceil said with all her love and gratitude for the Melian girl softening her voice."
0,“I am glad that you have come with us this far.
0,"I cannot even begin to think what would have happened, how terrible our journey would have been without you, but your time with us ends here.”"
0,“I am not leaving!” Lemi protested harder.
0,"Ceil’s head throbbed from Lemi’s shout, but she swallowed her irritation, drowning it in her love for Lemi."
0,"“Although my mind was distant, I remember everything you said, everything you told me while you took care of me."
0,Remember our deal back in Melia?
0,"You said that if you were pregnant, you would go back home.”"
0,"“But Sammy… Sammy said I could stay with you,” Lemi tried to explain."
0,"“And now Sammy must go with you,” Ceil explained, hoping that Lemi was mature enough to understand."
0,“You have a daughter now.
0,You should think of her more than anyone else.
0,You are in charge of Sammy’s safety.
0,The Afarit is too dangerous for you… and so am I.”
0,Lemi’s eyes widened.
0,"She now knew that Ceil had heard everything, even what Lemi told Inym concerning the damage Ceil’s proximity to her caused."
0,"Tears filled Lemi’s eyes, and she shook her head in denial."
0,“Sammy will live on through your daughter.
0,"That is your responsibility now.” Ceil reached over and pulled Lemi in, holding the young mother close."
0,Lemi remained with Ceil the rest of the morning as she finished preparations for departure.
0,All the Vallen party and a small guard of Lycon met at the north pass out of the city ready for departure.
0,"Ceil explained the decision concerning Lemi to everyone present, including revealing publicly for the first time that Lemi was expecting and the name Lemi gave her daughter."
0,Both Justin and Chloe expressed their congratulations while at the same time shed tears for the parting of a dear friend.
0,"Ceil knelt in front of Coby, looking up into his eyes."
0,She scratched lightly at his breast feathers.
0,"He was intelligent, and so she knew he would understand the importance of his task."
0,“You once protected Sammy.
0,Now Sammy lives on through Lemi.
0,I want you to take Lemi back home  and keep her and her daughter safe.
0,"If all goes well in the Afarit, I will go back and see you there."
0,Can you do this?”
0,Coby answered with a confident cry.
0,Ceil hugged him and held on for a long while.
0,This was not a parting of one companion but two.
0,"Ceil chastised Sammy for saving Coby and bringing him along in the beginning, but now Coby was as much a dear friend as Lemi, and he had protected Ceil time and time again."
0,She hoped that he would continue that same devotion towards Lemi.
0,Ceil wrapped a thick fur cloak around Lemi.
0,"After Lemi’s final farewell to her friends and a promise to meet again after their business was finished in the wilderlands, Coby grabbed Lemi and carried her off into the sky."
0,"“To the Afarit,” Ceil announced, ready to do her part to convince Bydrofe to end this war."
0,The party left the cold mountains for much hotter lands.
0,* * *
1,Ephora breathed a sigh of relief.
0,"Although the events were all different, and the death of the ancestral Lurr of Whinhlem was an astounding surprise, Ceil was able to continue north."
0,"The events would unfold as predicted from here, she hoped, but for a time she was fearful."
0,"Because of her mistake in revealing that Jethro was vital to surviving the calamity Ceil would bring, all the sprites were blind to the future."
0,"She had thought that their predictions would cloud over for a few days at most as all her former involvement had done, but the darkness persisted, strong and unyielding."
0,"She had admonished the Arkhon for acting without consulting the sprites, but now she did the same with far worse consequences than any independent action he had taken."
0,"He made calculated risks, never taking any action that might result in prolonged blindness , but she did not weigh the risk properly, and she realized this too late."
0,"More than simple fear, the unknown was terrifying to a being who should always know the future."
0,That was the very reason she feared Sammy so.
0,Ceil almost slipped into darkness multiple times.
0,The comfort offered by the Aspect of Death was death.
0,"One mistake and Ceil could have died, releasing death where it could spread unabated."
0,"Now that fate resumed its course, Ephora trusted that Ceil would die as predicted in the Afarit where Bydrofe could directly mitigate the initial fallout of the Aspect of Death’s release."
0,Chapter 19
0,“The Key to the Prize”
1,"Jethro stared into the dark, his vision seemingly passing through the cold stone of his studio into the night sky."
0,"He was watching, waiting."
0,"He directed his ven to monitoring the inter-world-teleportation-inhibiting magic cast on him by the sprite, checking the timer on it as if it was a pocket watch."
0,"He checked it again and again, counting down the invisible seconds."
0,He gave Eydis time and an offer to return her to Whinhlem.
0,"He never gave away his location, but through her magic and the cooperation of the United States government, she had many options to make her will known."
0,"Still, he waited in vain, and now she was out of time."
0,He thought that his threat would be sufficient incentive.
0,"He thought she cared about that young girl married to Emperor Yuro, but he was mistaken."
0,Perhaps he should have used that time mage as the bargain instead.
0,Even the coldest in heart still clung to their lover.
0,"Jethro did not know where that man was on Whinhlem, only that he was there, just like Ceil."
0,Perhaps he would search for him after eliminating the girl.
0,“Do you have everything?” Jethro asked Fect.
0,Fect slung his backpack over his shoulders.
0,“Ready.”
0,"Jethro stood, his eyes continuing to stare into nothing."
0,"He raised his hand, carefully monitoring the ven he channeled through it to activate the spatial teleportation formula."
0,"After a deep breath, he thrust his fingers into the space before him."
0,The tips disappeared into a crack that split vertically in the air.
0,Jethro’s heart quickened.
0,"He peeled the crack open revealing a black portal that no light could penetrate, especially in the dark of night."
0,Jethro had no time to voice his relief or excitement.
0,He could not take any more chances.
0,He grabbed Fect by the collar and pulled him through.
0,"The darkness wrapped around and constricted him, resisting as if he was standing deep over his head in a muddy flowing stream, but his spatial formula pulled him against the flow."
0,"Jethro and Fect exited into an unknown location, certainly not where Jethro had planned to teleport."
0,They landed in a jungle of variegated ivy.
0,"The moment their feet touched the dense leaves, vines grew and latched onto him."
0,He sent Fect away to Tolmyur in an emergency transmission but was too slow to save himself.
0,"He felt pain in his legs, then numbness."
0,"His ven seized before his second transmission formula activated, and he could no longer take action for himself."
0,"The moment he realized who owned the ivy, his vision grew dark."
0,* * *
1,Keeya never expected to see the return of her former master.
0,"The moment she detected spatial magic and felt two pairs of feet step on her dense ivy that covered the palace’s central courtyard, she immediately tried to create two new thralls."
0,"The minum escaped, but now that she knew the second was Jethro, she had reservations."
0,She owed him nothing.
0,Her contracted servitude was broken.
0,Why then did she hesitate?
0,"Like every thrall she dominated, she read the thoughts and memories of the individual, transplanting them into the verdant garden of her endless mind, now bright under the sunlight and cultivated instead of dark and overgrown as it had once been before she let her roots grow free."
0,What saved Jethro from a mindless fate and eternal servitude to the apogee of dryad power were his genuine feelings of companionship towards Keeya.
0,"True, at first she was no more than a tool to him and a means of controlling Emer, but over the days spent in study and research together, a kinship had grown."
0,"He held ire for Emer due to Emer’s elf heritage, but Jethro reserved none for her."
0,"In its place there was pity towards the plight of the Kissiae, a truth that could not be hid, pulled directly from his inner-most thoughts."
0,"So, she spared Jethro, desiring instead to speak with him."
0,"Although she knew his thoughts, she could only theorize how he would react to what she had done to his soldiers, to the Amelian Palace, and to Amel."
0,"Keeya did not fear Jethro’s wrath, because now the combined knowledge and experience of both Emer and Jethro were planted in her mind’s garden."
0,"Through Emer, she had access to not only spatial magic but also the four natural elements, and of course her own life magic now far more powerful as a Hamadryad than it had ever been."
0,"For now, she wanted first to better examine the bizarre plant that was Jethro’s knowledge and memories."
0,All the plants in her mind’s garden were similar enough in form divided into two major species between the elfkind of Amel and the humankind of Tolmyur.
0,Cultures and customs in their roots were alike within individual races.
0,They had similar knowledge and experience in their branches.
0,Only the leaves of thought and the fruits of their actions differed between individuals.
0,"Those of Tolmyur were of a hardy and weathered breed, strengthened through endless storms that threatened to uproot many, but their roots grew stronger and bound together through such trials."
0,"The outward appearance of the elfkind was majestic and beautiful, and their branches intertwined with those who were alike, but their roots were shallow and weak and only held together by fragile fibers of unity through the Amelian banner."
0,Keeya understood how the empire had fallen so quickly.
0,"The storm brought by Tolmyur had moistened the soil, and the races of elfkind were torn away from each other through the landslide of Jethro’s might."
0,"Despite the differences between elfkind and humankind, they appeared nearly identical and familiar to Keeya when compared to the foreign abomination that was Jethro’s mind, appearing as if an alien plant had grown in a failed attempt to mimic the Tolmyurin flora of her garden."
0,"Jethro’s roots branched little with one single shoot digging deep into the ground, anchoring him into his upbringing on his home world Trattnou, a world of advanced magical society and unified global populous where their god governed personally; a world of incredible science, art, and terrifying weaponry, where people lived both on their mother planet and in the void of space."
0,"Keeya spent four days among the memories of Jethro’s world, absorbing his education on magic, the mind, and technology."
0,"He was only a young man when he came to Whinhlem by chance, and she could only guess just how rich Jethro’s mind would have become had he remained on Trattnou."
0,"Although the single shoot of Jethro’s roots dug strong and deep, a small number of lateral roots branched out to anchor the few he could trust to the knowledge of his world."
0,"He taught little and only when necessary, fearing the impact his world’s knowledge might have on Whinhlem."
0,The magical technologies of Trattnou could destroy this world.
0,Only through the oversight of Trattnou’s god could that world survive itself.
0,The stalks of Jethro’s memories differed from the people of Amel and soldiers of Tolmyur.
0,"They were colored by trials, companionship, and love of those he met in the eastern wilderlands."
0,"From there the branches mimicked those of Tolmyur, but as they grew, they twisted and deformed."
0,"Keeya uncovered the source of Jethro’s pain and malice, a loss of loved ones held dear, and a plea for help from Amel that was answered with the darkest evil."
0,Racial prejudice grew strong in the roots of the High Elves.
0,An individual convinced that another was inferior and undeserving of even the most meager of graces could justify and relish in the most grievous of atrocities committed against them.
0,"Despite searching three days through her garden, she could not find the order that led to the death of Jethro’s infant daughter, his last remaining family."
0,None of the council members present when the order was given or those who executed the order were among her thralls.
0,All in power were killed when Jethro seized Amel.
0,"Keeya only had Jethro’s memories that malformed the ends of his branches, and those memories pointed at Eydis as the perpetrator."
0,"Although his leaves were beautiful to behold, the fruit he bore was a strong poison that threatened to affect Keeya the longer she tasted, drawing her into his malice."
0,Keeya distanced herself from Jethro’s memories and watched him in the soft ivy bed of the palace’s west garden.
0,She pitied him.
0,He once had all the makings of the greatest king to have graced Whinhlem.
0,He could have brought about the longest golden age since the height of the ancient human civilization.
0,Now he was nothing more than a creature of vengeance the High Elves created.
1,"“Jethro,” Keeya spoke, waking him from his slumber."
0,Jethro roused but did not startle.
0,His eyes examined the overflowing garden and clear sky painted in sunset.
0,He sat up finding Emer sitting before him on a mound of coiled ivy like a lush and verdant blister in the center of the garden court.
0,"Keeya remained latched to Emer’s back, and her ageless eyes stared into him, no longer the meek child she had once seemed."
0,Other Kissiae watched from the branches of the trees or hidden among the shrubs on the ground.
0,Four giants and three High Elves stood guard around the perimeter of the garden.
0,The guards were alive but not.
0,"Their skin was withered like old men, and their features were sunken."
0,"A few ivy leaves sprouted from between their armor, and thin vines coiled and crawled on and under their skin."
0,"Their eyes saw Jethro but at the same time did not see him, as if their senses came only from the focus of the controlling ivy’s attention."
0,"These were Kissiae thralls, and the variegated coloring of the leaves informed Jethro to whom the thralls belonged."
0,"Keeya carefully monitored Jethro’s thoughts such that he would not notice her presence in his mind, searching for his response to seeing her domination of his men."
0,"He was curious more than scared or angry, but then his curiosity changed to worry."
0,"In his mind, he never thought Keeya would betray him, and so his only conclusion was that something had happened that forced her drastic actions."
0,His intellect was as bright and beautiful as the leaves of his plant in her mind’s garden.
0,"“Keeya, what happened?” Jethro asked, not condemning her but out of honest worry."
0,Jethro was unaware that her control spread throughout all the capital city of Amel.
0,"He thought she had created a haven within the palace gardens for protection, possibly from his soldiers."
0,His assumptions were not far from the truth.
0,"“I am a hamadryad now,” Keeya informed him."
0,"Emer stood, showing where her Ivy hair rooted into the ground."
0,"Unlike most hamadryads whose bodies grew into majestic trees, ivy dryads took root with their hair and had range of motion around where they rooted."
0,Jethro’s thoughts alternated blame towards his men to his own lack of foresight.
0,"Keeya was the matriarch of the Kissiae, the eldest among them."
0,He knew this.
0,He was familiar enough with dryad physiology to know that resisting the change to a hamadryad was incredibly difficult to nigh impossible.
0,"He reasoned that the hamadryad process had begun in the span of time he was on Earth, and because he had ordered Keeya to remain on the palace grounds, she had no choice but to take root in the west garden."
0,The thralls under her command were the unfortunate who were snared during her evolution.
0,"In all this, Jethro never once considered blaming Keeya."
0,"“You are mistaken,” Keeya answered Jethro’s thoughts, revealing that she was in his mind."
0,"Suddenly, Jethro’s thoughts froze into perfect silence, a skill he perfected in his own world to protect his research knowledge from those who could scry thought."
0,"He trusted her in his memory, but that did not mean he would continue to do so should the balance change between them."
0,"He was cautious, and the last fleeting thought of his mind before it grew silent was a fear that Keeya would learn of the knowledge from his world, so perhaps silencing his mind was for her protection, not his."
0,"Keeya had no way to know without taking control of his thoughts, and doing so would betray Jethro’s trust in her, creating a rift between them."
0,"Again, Keeya questioned why she did not want to dominate him."
0,It would be simple and advantageous for her to do so.
0,"Was it his honest feelings of companionship towards her, or was it her feelings of pity towards him?"
0,She did not know.
0,"“Tell me what happened,” Jethro said, his words and the worried emotions accompanying them breaking the silence of his mind for but a moment before the silence returned."
0,"“As you wish.” Keeya shared with him her memories of first discovering the dryads cooked by the chef staff, the feeling of the first Kissiae dying in Vallen, her travel to Elos to discover that the Kissiae had been conscripted for the assault on Revlan, and her attempted rescue and failure to save fifteen of her daughters."
0,She finished by sharing her regret and how she felt that she had failed as the matriarch of the Kissiae.
0,She sent it all directly to Jethro’s mind without a single spoken word as if those memories were his.
0,She left out the involvement of the Tolmyur generals or who gave the order.
0,What would he do with that knowledge?
0,How would he react?
0,"Keeya wanted to test Jethro, to see if she could trust him."
0,"Thankfully, Jethro assumed that Keeya did not withhold any of her memories pertaining to the event, making him assume she did not know why such a tragedy occurred."
0,Jethro’s mind lit with the spark of inquiry that quickly grew into a blaze of cogitation.
0,"Possibilities of events in his absence, mainly concerning the Vallen campaign, flashed one after another searching for what could have led to the Kissiae being conscripted into the final battle at Revlan."
0,Byurk would not conscript the dryads.
0,"He wanted to spare as many of the races as possible, even his enemies."
0,Something led to a call for reinforcements from Amel for which the generals present did not feel their stationed forces adequate.
0,The Vallen campaign was progressing smoothly and quickly when Jethro left for Earth.
0,"Something changed, but what?"
0,"If the dryads had chosen to aid Vallen, that might have been cause enough for emergency aid from Amel, but all the dryads were on Tolmyur’s side assaulting the city in Keeya’s memory."
0,A greater force was at play.
0,Jethro’s mind continued to draw back on the massive explosion of fire that killed the final Kissiae that Keeya could not rescue in time.
0,No mage could have produced it.
0,"A name and face of a woman from Jethro’s past flashed in his mind, Basara."
0,"She had the power, but Basara would never create such a coarse flame."
0,Hers were far more elegant.
0,And he doubted that she would join the war against him.
0,“A bomb?” Jethro whispered.
0,Such technology did not exist on Whinhlem.
0,"None of the races had discovered gunpowder, and their reliance on magic lessened the need for it, but the nature of the explosion certainly did not look like a magical flame."
0,"It appeared catalytic, chemical."
0,"Various images of explosions flashed through Jethro’s mind until he found the nearest match to what he saw in Keeya’s memory, and oil-based explosion."
0,Such an explosion could be possible on Whinhlem with the right ingenuity and enough fuel.
0,Fairies lived in harmony with nature.
0,"They would never, even in their most dire of times, create an oil-based bomb."
0,Suddenly the face of the sprite on Earth dominated Jethro’s thoughts.
0,"He tried to send some humans from earth to Tolmyur, but his teleportation was intercepted mid-cast by a sprite."
0,"Sprites, like humans, lived on every world Jethro had been to, but on Whinhlem sprites were allies of the Amelian Empire."
0,"If that sprite changed the destination of his magic to Vallen, those humans from Earth could have aided the fairies against their common enemy, Tolmyur."
0,Earth was far more technologically advanced than Whinhlem.
0,"Although Jethro was careful about what knowledge he shared with people of this world, those humans might not be so reserved."
0,"Keeya was amazed that with only the information she gave him, he nearly deduced what had happened."
0,Humans from the world Jethro invaded appeared in the Vallen campaign shortly after Jethro contacted the palace to inform them that his invasion of Earth failed.
0,"The generals could not take any risks and so sent a support army from Amel to ensure victory in Vallen, but they felt their forces insufficient against people from a world that defeated him."
0,"They conscripted dryads for the battle, including the Kissiae whom Jethro promised to protect, and turned those who refused into food reserves for a siege."
0,"Jethro brought humans from Earth to Whinhlem, beginning the chain that led to the death of the fifteen Kissiae."
0,"Keeya noticed guilt appear in Jethro’s heart, but it was fleeting."
0,He specifically gave an order that the Kissiae were under the protection of Tolmyur and were to be spared from any danger.
0,His generals disobeyed that order.
0,Jethro’s expression changed to one Keeya had never seen.
0,"Jethro was usually lighthearted in demeanor, and occasionally she had seen his wrath when it was directed at Emer, but now his face bore the rigid determination to right a wrong."
0,"He once held a strong sense of justice that had warped over time due to his trauma, but here it sparked as true as it had in his youth."
0,There was no deception or guile in his heart.
0,Keeya began to feel that she could trust him.
0,“Do you have the commander who gave the order to conscript the Kissiae among your thralls?”
0,"“I do not,” Keeya replied."
0,“They have returned from Vallen and are camped without the city walls beyond the reach of my vines.
0,"If he survived the battle, he would be there.”"
0,“Allow me to find the one responsible so that he may answer to both you and me.”
0,"“Go,” Keeya said in the more childlike tone of her pre-Hamadryad self and released her hold on Jethro."
0,A light smile rose in her lips.
0,She did not care whether Jethro would return after hearing the tale from the perspective of his commanders.
0,She had no need to kill or enslave him.
0,"She trusted now that he would not try to harm her or her daughters, and that was enough."
0,Perhaps he would continue his agreement to protect them.
0,"In a world that she felt was united against the Kissiae, this man who came from a different world might be her one and only ally."
0,"However, should he ever cross her, she now had both the power and knowledge to end him."
0,* * *
1,"Jethro stood on a barrier high above the former capital city, Amel."
0,"He had assumed Keeya’s vines did not spread further than the palace when she told him that his soldiers were without the walls outside her reach, but dense variegated ivy spread all the way to and up the far walls of the city, not the walls of the palace."
0,What had once been a thriving metropolis was now a verdant jungle.
0,"The plants of the city were overgrown, empowered by Keeya’s vines."
0,Vines reached across the bridges crossing the thin river that ran southeast.
0,"Although the sunset painted the city in deep shadows, Jethro could see countless thralls lumbering through the streets and alleys, men, women, and children alike."
0,The thralls nearest the palace were his soldiers.
0,Bodies hardened by war made better protectors.
0,"From the numbers, all his men who were stationed elsewhere around the city were gathered there."
0,"In all, he assumed he lost anywhere from three to six thousand depending on how many were able to flee the city as the vines spread."
0,He could learn the exact number from those in the army camp.
0,The camp was situated on the north side of the city in what had formerly been the commerce block outside the walls where local farmers and merchants traded and managed supplies in bulk without needing to crowd the grand marketplace near Amel’s south center where the general populous dealt business.
0,"He had sent his soldiers directly into the city during the assault on Amel, so the outer areas were largely spared the destruction."
0,"The numerous warehouses for storage and wide fields for livestock trade made the location ideal for the hundreds of thousands of soldiers he initially brought, turning it into a camp city rivaling Amel in size."
0,"He was relieved to see that the vines never reached the camp, but at the same time, the camp seemed odd."
1,Jethro teleported directly to the city-facing entrance of the camp.
0,The guards stationed at the entrance were so inebriated that they did not notice him.
0,Unintelligible shouts hummed through the air like a sick breeze.
0,No one within the camp recognized Jethro standing at the entrance because he was not wearing his usual robes.
0,"He was dressed in Earth attire, had hair nearly to his shoulders, and had grown a goatee, so he could understand at least a little why no call to attention was made at his approach."
0,"He snagged a cloak from the passed-out watch and walked into the camp under his shroud of anonymity, more worried that anyone could have walked into the camp without alarm."
0,"The air was always foul in a war camp, but it hung heavier than in his memory, either because he had grown accustomed to the cleaner living on Earth or because the cleanliness of the camp had grown slack."
0,No one appeared to be working in any form.
0,"One tent Jethro passed was filled with sleeping men, mostly unclothed."
0,He could not tell if the sole elf woman among them was alive or dead.
0,He transmitted her into the city to either become a thrall or nutrients for the overgrown plants and vines.
0,"In other tents, the soldiers cast lots over games of tibrem where a forked stick and small ring were tossed between co-betters in a game of skill to hook the ring on the stick once both fell into a circle drawn on the ground."
0,Only now Jethro realized that the camp was in the middle of the traditional twelve-day victory celebration.
0,They must have just returned from the Vallen campaign.
0,"If that was the case, he could not judge them too severely, but the lack of security, especially after the city was overtaken by Keeya, was simply aggravating."
0,Perhaps they were so lax because they were also mourning the many lost not only in Vallen but also Amel?
0,Jethro sighed.
0,He needed to speak with a captain or general to ascertain the truth of what was happening in the camp.
1,The camp’s commander headquarters was established in the former trade office.
0,"Jethro was relieved to find a lone, rather young soldier at attention guarding the structure, the first he had seen in all the camp."
0,The boy could barely be a year and a half of age.
0,Jethro approached and was greeted with a spear aimed at his chest.
0,He was not alarmed.
0,"His face was shaded in the hood of his grunt soldier cloak, so the boy could not have recognized him."
0,“Only officers are permitted beyond this point.
0,"State your name and business,” the boy ordered."
0,"Jethro faintly recognized the boy’s face but not his name, having seen the headquarter guard in the scant times he personally visited the camp."
0,A faint smile spread across his lips.
0,He relaxed his throat to deepen his voice.
0,“The security of your camp is lax.
0,"Anyone could enter disguised as one of your own, and you would be none the wiser."
0,A pity.”
0,The boy called for reinforcements while thrusting his spear an inch from Jethro’s chest.
0,“Identify yourself!”
0,"“That will not be necessary,” Jethro replied as three lieutenants and the captain in charge of the camp exited with weapons drawn."
0,"“I am sure Captain Drommer could do that for me,” he said in his regular tone."
0,"Captain Drommer, a minum, peered up into Jethro’s hood."
0,His eyes squinted and then grew wide.
0,"“Lower your weapons,” he hollered, kneeling to the ground."
0,"“Forgive us, Commanding General Jethro."
0,We did not recognize you.”
0,The young guard aiming his hostility at Jethro dropped his spear in terror and pressed his face into the ground.
0,"“Forgive me, my Lord.”"
0,Jethro smiled and knelt to the ground.
0,"Grasping the guard by the hand, he lifted the boy to his feet."
0,“There is nothing to forgive.
0,"Instead, you should be commended."
0,"Of all my soldiers, of the many men in this camp much older than you, you alone had wisdom to confront a stranger who entered the camp."
0,What is your name?”
0,The boy looked into Jethro’s eyes in awe.
0,"“Atson , son of Meton, son of Hemlet,” he replied."
0,"Stating a third generation was uncommon, and only done when descending from a name of renown, and General Hemlet was indeed renowned."
0,“How is the grandson of a hero of the Coastal War a mere guard?”
0,"“My father is the eleventh son, the youngest, and I am my father’s seventh, also youngest,” Atson replied with conviction in his voice, lacking any spite for his lowly placement in a hero’s lineage."
0,"“You take great pride in your lineage,” Jethro replied, rather pleased."
0,"Although he never met the old general personally, his feats were nearly comparable to Jethro’s own."
0,The southern shores would have become desolate beyond recovery if not for his efforts.
0,“Yes.
0,"It is an honor to carry the blood of a great man, no matter how thin,” the boy replied."
0,"“Captain Drommer, see that this boy receives proper training under your care to become captain of our camp guard."
0,Our men could learn much from his character.”
0,The boy bowed deep before Jethro’s declaration.
0,"“As you will,” Captain Drommer replied."
0,“Is a general present?” Jethro asked now that his ruse and inspection of the camp met its conclusion.
0,“General Bregon has claimed the officer’s quarters on the third floor.
0,"His mood is fowl, and he has demanded not to be disturbed."
0,I hope your return will lift his spirits.”
0,Captain Drommer’s news was ill. Perhaps the Vallen campaign was not as successful as Jethro hoped.
1,He made his way to the third floor and opened the door.
0,General Bregon’s massive frame was hunched over a table covered in a map and scattered documents.
0,"He looked up, and like the others before, he did not recognize Jethro at first, but his realization came swift."
0,"“I knew you would return,” General Bregon said, returning to sifting through the piles of documents."
0,"“After your urgent message, we feared the worst, but one of your strength would not fall so easily.”"
0,“I have been sorely reminded numerous times that there are those far more powerful than I both on this world and on others.
0,I was bested beyond compare.
0,Now I return from my internment on Earth to find we have lost control of Amel and our soldiers lacking all order.
0,Do Tolmyur’s armies become incompetent with the absence of one man?”
0,"General Bregon tensed, and Jethro could tell it was not from guilt but anger."
0,The source was yet to be seen.
0,"“For all your knowledge and power, you are not free of error, Commanding General."
0,"Byurk, whom you left in command of the Vallen campaign, has in his own poor judgement let Yuro’s widow escape into the wilderlands beyond our reach.”"
0,“Byurk is no fool.
0,"If the widow escaped to the wilderlands, I doubt any of our officers could have prevented it.”"
0,"General Bregon sat up straight in his stool, the wood crying under his weight."
0,"“He took pity on the fairies, and that pity lost us our prize at great cost."
0,The Vallen campaign was for naught.
0,"In addition, I have often been critical of the free reign you gave that half-breed elf and Kissiae slave, and now you see the state of Amel."
0,We lost nearly five thousand of our best soldiers and all but four of our commanding officers to that Kissiae.
0,Order is broken because we lack those to keep it.
0,"I alone remained to rebuild our chain of command, sifting through whatever scant military records not in the palace to find suitable men who could shoulder such responsibilities,” General Bregon grumbled, crinkling a sheet of rough parchment in his fist."
0,"“You should be with your men to find those of worth, not hiding among stacks of parchment."
0,"I found one promising boy guarding the door of this very building, but these stone walls have made you too blind to notice,” Jethro quipped as he scanned through a sheet of parchment that General Bregon discarded."
0,“Spare me the ridicule.
0,"You may have climbed ranks through your own merit from a mercenary, but those who you enabled to do the same are now dead or thralls of the Kissiae."
0,"If we are to restore order, we need men of proper lineage and education from known families, military lines that soldiers will obey out of obligation.”"
0,Jethro breathed an aggravated sigh.
0,"The young guard was one such man, but the documents General Bregon trusted would never tell him."
0,He dropped his casual demeanor and continued with the seriousness born by his position as master of all Tolmyur’s armies.
0,"“When I look for who can lead the armies of Tolmyur, I choose men who produce results no matter the difficulty of the order given."
0,"You have chosen to take command of parchment, not men."
0,"As such, I am removing you from your position.”"
0,"General Bregon stood from his chair, his head nearly touching the arched ceiling."
0,"“Even as Commanding General, you would need approval of three other generals to remove me, and those in Amel would assuredly agree with my methods.”"
0,"“I would rather not use force,” Jethro warned, his eyes daggers."
0,Bregon reached behind him for his broad-leafed spear knowing well that he could never defend against Jethro should Jethro decide to eliminate him.
0,"Before Bregon could grab it, his body locked inside a barrier and his voice seized."
0,“Do not get hasty.
0,"My plan was to be lenient depending on what I learned, but you forced my hand."
0,"I said you were removed from your position, but you still could have been of use elsewhere."
0,"As you stated, we are severely lacking those who could keep order."
0,Now I know that you are incapable of following orders let alone being able to give them.
0,"You are right that if I wanted to remove you due to incompetence, I would need the vote of three other generals."
0,I am certainly not the type to circumvent that step by eliminating you as past Commanding Generals would have.
0,Lucky you.
0,"However, I can remove you for disobedience without the need for approval.”"
0,Jethro paced around the table and cleared the parchment off the map.
0,"It was extravagantly drawn, likely something Bregon had pillaged from Vallen."
0,"His hand fell on Dhuillir, and his finger tapped the unmarked location of Elos."
0,“I gave an order to all generals and captains that the Kissiae were not to be touched.
0,"You led a support army from Amel to aid Captain Byurk in Vallen, and as you passed through Dhuillir, you conscripted the Kissiae along with other dryads."
0,Is this correct?”
0,"Bregon found himself able to speak, and he knew that if he answered anything other than what Jethro asked, his voice would be silenced once again."
0,"“The Kissiae joined us of their own will, their matriarch leading them.”"
0,“Are you saying you never gave an order to involve the Kissiae?
0,The road to Vallen through Dhuillir does not pass near Elos.”
0,“Captain Kolbur chose to enlist the Kissiae for--”
0,"“I have heard enough,” Jethro sighed and locked Bregon’s voice."
0,He did not recognize a captain by that name--a new appointment perhaps.
0,"Assuming what Bregon said was true, he still would have had to give the order."
0,No small party could have reached the Kissiae in the center of the Elos marshes.
0,"Bregon was commander of the support army, so any captain would have needed his permission to take a platoon well off course to Elos."
0,"Not only did Bregon disobey Jethro, but he was also shirking responsibility."
0,Removing him was the best decision.
0,“Your choice to involve the Kissiae has resulted in the loss of Amel and the nearly five thousand soldiers stationed there.
0,"As such, you will be punished, but the manner of punishment will not be mine to decide.”"
1,"Bregon vanished, and Jethro immediately followed, reappearing atop a barrier floating above the ground in the palace garden."
0,"Keeya roused, and Emer sat up upon the mound of ivy."
0,"“I did not expect you to return so quickly,” Keeya spoke into both Jethro and Bregon’s minds so her voice would not have to carry."
0,Jethro smiled.
0,"“You weren’t completely truthful when you shared your memories with me,” he realized."
0,"“Or should I say, you did not share everything."
0,"Before I hand him to you, I must be certain."
0,"Did this man give the order to involve the Kissiae, leading to the loss of your sisters?”"
0,Joy welled within Keeya strong enough for the emotion to pierce Jethro’s mind.
0,"Only now did he realize that when she had hold of him, she left behind a connection to him."
0,"He did not know the strength of the connection, but she may have been monitoring his conversation with Bregon at the camp."
0,"He felt the faint thought in her heart, that she was happy to have an ally in him."
0,"“Yes,” Keeya replied."
0,“Then he is yours to do with as you will.” Jethro dropped Bregon into the vines and released the barrier.
0,Bregon struggled for only a second before the Kissiae’s domination took hold.
0,"“The request came from a human named Kolbur, but Bregon gave the order,” Keeya explained into Jethro’s thoughts."
0,"“However, you should know that had my daughters not come to his aid, he and his support army would have fallen to the dryads resisting his advance into Vallen.”"
0,“That only shows his weakness as a leader of my armies.
0,And what of the Vallen campaign had that happened?”
0,"“Given the status of the city, your friend, Byurk, would have won through starvation, but the one you seek would most likely have escaped north still.”"
0,"“I see,” Jethro replied, pondering how he would search for the widow now that she escaped to the wilderlands."
0,"He was familiar with the heavily forested eastern wilderlands where he first arrived on Whinhlem, but the western wilderlands were mostly unknown."
0,"“In gratitude for your understanding and willingness to support the Kissiae, I can locate the widow of Yuro for you.”"
0,Jethro’s eyes widened in surprise.
0,"Did Keeya always have this ability, unknown to him?"
0,How quickly could he have finished his revenge had he known?
0,Could he have taken Keeya to Earth with him to locate the princess as well?
0,"“It would have been impossible for my former self,” Keeya replied, knowing Jethro’s thoughts."
0,"“My power has grown immensely as a Hamadryad, and without Bregon, I would not know whom to seek."
0,The widow was sheltered away from most in the palace.
0,None who remained from your occupation knew her.
0,Only by giving Bregon in atonement have you made this possible.
0,Located within his memories is the widow’s appearance.
0,"He met her in Revlan of Vallen, so now I can search for her among the lifeforces of the wilderlands."
0,"The wilderlands are vast, but my magic can reach."
0,It will take time.”
0,Chapter 20
0,“The Afarit”
1,Sweat ran as a stream down Ceil’s nape to her back.
0,The once wing-like bow of her bind now hung drenched and clung to her skin.
0,"Dyson had warned her that she would miss the cold, but she never could have imagined the severity of his warning and just how wrong she was to think he only spoke in jest."
0,The snow had continued only for the first two days after departing north from Sen’uon.
0,The road was rocky but flat enough for easy travel.
0,"The mountains were behind them giving way to rolling, rocky hills littered with ruins here and there."
0,"From there the rain fell hard and heavy, muddying the ground slick and deep to be nearly impassible."
0,Justin grew ill from the frigid rain and had to be carried for that day as Tyree monitored him.
0,"With only a single lung, Ceil worried that any respiratory illness would debilitate him despite both his and Tyree’s assurance that with dryad care she had no need to worry."
0,Even Ceil found it odd how she worried for him.
0,"In the past, any worry regarding Justin was on Sammy’s behalf, but now her worry was for Justin himself."
0,"After all, he was one of the few people she had left who cared for her as a friend, who cared for her for her sake and not for her position or role in what future may come."
0,"If Justin cared for Ceil for her sake, she wanted to care for him for his."
0,"The rain warmed and became sparse the following day, but it was not a rain Ceil had ever experienced."
0,"The moisture in the air stung her eyes, and the clouds above their head glowed brown."
0,"The rain tasted bitter, and Zose warned that she should not drink it."
0,The many large water skins they had filled when the rain was frigid were now their only source of clean water until they reached an Afarit settlement in four or five days.
0,"Their only water mage was Byurk, and he alone could not supply enough to sustain their party, especially when fighting off his own dehydration in the intense heat to come."
0,The hills became jagged with massive spines of black stone like barbed spearheads eating away at the crumbling ruins now so widespread that the land in its entirety was more akin to a devastated city as far as the eye could see.
0,"The gravel of the road cut at the soles of Ceil’s sandals, and if she let her toes slip forward past the edge of the hardened leather, they would bleed."
0,"Justin was amazed at the geological structures all around him, calling the razor-sharp, black monoliths obsidian."
0,"Zose warned that the stones absorbed heat, creating a barrier that kept the outer lands they already traveled cooler."
0,"Once they passed the black crystal band, their final two days would be the hardest."
0,And they were.
1,Ceil wanted to strip her bind and skirt and walk naked in the unbearable heat.
0,"Only Chloe and Hethyro were unaffected, and somehow Basara beamed with energy."
0,All the land glowed orange with rivers of molten stone flowing in the distance.
0,Flame spat at the road but never reached.
0,"The road snaked and bent following the only safe route through the fire wastes, climbing up and down often sheer rock faces of coarse volcanic stone."
0,The terrain could not be altered using earth magic to ease travel for fear of awakening underground veins of fire or molten rock and destroying their path outright.
0,"They had no other choice but to struggle across narrow cliffside passes with lakes of fire below, climb vertical sheets of stone where the only aids were small footholds created by those who came before, and trudging through hot and deep pumice sand that sapped what endurance might have survived."
0,"The sparse stretches of flatter, winding road through dried lava fields were a paradise by comparison."
0,“How could anything live in such a place?” Ceil moaned.
0,"“If not for the afarit, there would probably be many mining communities living here."
0,The concentration of resfahil deposits only grow the closer we reach the center.
0,Past the wastes the heat dies down a little.
0,"It shouldn’t be any worse than the hottest summer days on the Filinceil Plains,” Zose explained."
0,"“There are areas of the deserts in Tolmyur that are as hot as we are here,” Basara explained."
0,"“Stay hydrated and you will be fine,” she said as she handed Ceil a frigid water skin Hethyro just cooled with his fire magic."
0,Ceil gulped down water so fast her throat stung and her head ached from the chill.
0,She then handed the skin to Justin.
0,He had his arm over Chloe’s shoulder just barely managing to keep pace.
0,"Ceil had helped for a short time, but then the heat became so unbearable that she could no longer stand another body against hers."
0,"“I wish I could cool my body,” Chloe said with a sigh."
0,She was now comfortable enough in Elven to use it in general conversation when around others besides just Justin and Ceil.
0,"“I do too,” Justin chuckled."
0,"Certainly, hanging on her shoulder would be far more pleasant were that the case."
0,"“Nothing can be done,” Basara said."
0,"“Normal fire mages can use their fire magic to cool, but maenads cannot.”"
0,Chloe retrieved the water skin from Justin and held it in her hand.
0,Frost gathered on the edge where she touched.
0,“I am human.
0,I am not a maenad.”
0,Basara stopped walking.
0,Her brows narrowed as she stared at Chloe who stopped a few paces ahead.
0,"“That cannot be,” she said."
0,“You must have some maenad in you.”
0,"“I am a human of Earth, like Justin,” Chloe replied, and Justin nodded."
0,“Impossible.
0,No human could have that strong of magic.
0,"Even Jethro’s ability solely comes from his knowledge and experience, not the strength of his affinity to spatial magic."
0,Humans simply do not have strong magic affinities.”
0,"“They are humans of Earth,” Ceil replied in Chloe’s defense as she trudged ahead using her Hamadryad staff as a crutch."
0,"“You should learn how to cool down your body,” Basara said to Chloe."
0,"“You can cool water, so the same technique can be applied to your body."
0,You should not have any problem overheating if you are not a maenad.” Mild exasperation seeped into her expression.
0,"With how often she heard warnings of Chloe’s potential to overheat, she simply thought there was nothing that could be done for it, because Chloe was a maenad."
0,"“I try, but I cannot,” Chloe admitted."
0,"“When my body is hot, if I use magic, I get hotter.”"
0,"“Control,” Basara admonished."
0,"“Your power surpasses mine, but you lack control.” That was all Chloe’s weakness amounted to."
0,"Before Basara could continue her lecture, she grabbed the water skin from Chloe and ran to the small pack of lycon acting both as guards for their party and ambassadors to the Afarit now that they conquered the southern gateway through the Hemenonan range."
0,Another of the lycon had collapsed from the heat.
0,Once again Ceil was reminded that she had no right to complain.
0,"She could remove clothing if necessary, but the already naked lycon who doffed their leather armor long ago could not remove their fur."
0,One more day.
0,That was the sole mantra that kept Ceil walking.
0,* * *
1,"On the evening of the following day, all at once the fire wastes ended as if some all-powerful hand had drawn a line in the land and heavens."
0,The road sloped downward into a massive caldera that stretched to the horizon.
0,The vortex of brown fire-clouds ended at the lip of a massive caldera opening to a clear sky like the eye of a storm.
0,Deep within the caldera was a ruined city of stone that sparkled like starlight mirrored in still waters.
0,It surrounded a circular crown of mountains rising higher than the rim of the caldera to reach the heavens.
0,"The shape of the ruins of the ancient human civilization looked familiar, the same as Revlan."
0,It was a sunken city of such a grand scale as to surpass any existing on the continent.
0,Ceil did not doubt that ten of the capital city of Amel could fit within its borders.
0,"However, the lights were sparse."
0,"The city was inhabited, but not by many for its size."
0,"“Welcome to the Afarit,” Zose said noticing Ceil’s mouth hung agape."
0,"“Largest city in the world, although in ancient times it is believed to have stretched to the Hemenonan."
0,The wilderlands are not as abandoned as many think.” He then nodded to Basara who raised her hand into the air.
0,A flare of ocean blue and sunlight gold launched into the air and burst into a shower of silver sparks twinkling in the night.
0,The sparks faded to gold and dimmed to blue before vanishing.
0,There they waited.
0,"Ceil asked the reason for the flare, but both Basara and Zose remained silent."
0,"Kiri alone spoke up, only stating that they could not enter the valley without permission."
0,Her lips bore a small grin.
0,"“Watch,” she said at last when a small line of firelights grew from the base of the caldera’s central crown."
0,"As the line slowly neared, Ceil noticed it was two lines, not one."
0,It extended past the borders of the city to where the ruins became rubble up the slope of the caldera.
0,"At its head grew a pair of vibrant blue and gold flames carried by two robed figures, and behind them was a procession."
0,"As the two at the head advanced, those in the procession moved to the side and lit small flames in their hands to continue lighting the path to the city."
0,Zose and Basara and everyone knelt to the ground almost in unison with Justin and Chloe quickly following.
0,"“You alone should not kneel,” Kiri admonished Ceil when she was about to do the same."
1,"The procession behind the lead flames grew short only a few yards ahead of where Ceil stood, and when only one remained, the flames parted and stood beside the path at the head of both lines."
0,The sole remaining man from the procession wore only a skirt gird about his waist that hung to his calves.
0,"His legs were similar in shape to spriggans, but his tail that hung behind was forked at the tip."
0,"His body was large and built, toned with aged muscle behind his dark, reddened skin like dried blood."
0,A simple cord woven from white hair hung from his neck and adorned his chest.
0,His hair was long and similarly woven into cords that hung down his bare back past his waist.
0,Thick but flat horns grew from the center atop his forehead and extended to his temples where they bent into a mild wave along the sides of his head.
0,"Many tassels hung from where the tips of his horns curled upwards, and two dark iron rings hung from his earlobes, stretching them to his shoulders where the rings rested."
0,"“You come bearing the colors of Amel, and yet I do not see the house of Amel,” the man spoke in Elven."
0,His voice had a deep but smooth timbre that made the back of Ceil’s neck shiver.
0,Kiri stood and knelt before the man.
0,"“Hain-henel, Lord of the Afarit, before you stands Ceil of the Ceilian Empire, widow of Yuro Amel, who has claimed all within the borders of the former Amelian Empire."
0,Hain-henel’s eyes bored through Ceil as if piercing her to her core.
0,“The house of Amel held contract with the Afarit to pay respects to the Guardian of Whinhlem when the heir reaches their third year.
0,"The house of Amel is a year late coming, and it is not their heir that visits but a widow in her third year in company of mercenaries, lycon, and Tolmyur.”"
0,"“A widow she may be, but the heir she remains, now Empress of all that the Amelian Empire once was.” Kiri responded."
0,Ceil grew nervous.
0,No one spoke or added in defense of Ceil’s standing.
0,She knew that she held no political power.
0,Her claim to a new empire was made in anger in a city that had long fallen.
0,Both the Amelian Empire and the Ceilian Empire did not exist.
0,"“And what is your name who speaks for her,” Hain-henel answered, breaking the deafening silence."
0,"“I am Kiri, Queen of Vallen and subject of Ceil, Empress.”"
0,This was the first time Ceil had heard Kiri refer to herself as queen.
0,"Certainly after the destruction of Vallen, Kiri was the sole surviving direct descendant of the Vallen royal line."
0,The hollow pit in Ceil’s stomach grew wider.
0,"Just like Amel, Vallen was no more."
0,Both Ceil and Kiri bore empty titles bereft of any authority.
0,“An empress of a broken house announces herself without tribute or gift to the Guardian of Whinhlem.
0,And here her enemy joins in her entourage.
0,What is the meaning of your arrival in our lands?”
0,Ceil took a deep breath and walked forward.
0,“I have come to supplicate the Guardian of Whinhlem for aid in ending the conflict that has plagued the continent for many generations.”
0,Kiri’s shoulder’s tensed.
0,"Ceil knew immediately that she spoke out of place, destroying the ceremony of her introduction, but her agonizing nerves could wait no longer."
0,Both Zose and Byurk approached and knelt beside Kiri.
0,"“I, Byurk, a general of Tolmyur, also desire an end to this war,” Byurk replied."
0,“I am prepared to receive proper punishment for the betrayal of my country so long as we achieve this end.”
0,"“Empress Ceil is not without tribute,” Zose added."
0,“Her life is a king’s bounty to be paid by Tolmyur from the coffers of the Amelian Palace.
0,I have brought Empress Ceil here to the Afarit so that your Lordship may claim the bounty on behalf of the Guardian of Whinhlem in lieu of tribute.
0,Your Lordship need only present her to Tolmyur once they arrive in the days following her supplication.”
0,“And does she willingly give herself for a chance to speak with the Guardian of Whinhlem?” Hain-henel asked.
0,Ceil’s mind grew blank.
0,"In order to speak with Bydrofe, Zose had arranged for her to be given to Tolmyur."
0,She looked beside her to Zose who only caught her glance for a moment before returning his gaze forward.
0,"Justin and Chloe exchanged glances between each other, and Ceil wondered if they fully understood the conversation in Elven, that their friend whom they tried so desperately to rescue would be given to their enemy."
0,The faces of the few surviving Tolmyur soldiers lit with epiphany as if only now realizing why their general had surrendered so readily.
0,"Lastly, Ceil’s eyes fell upon the back of Kiri’s head."
0,Kiri never moved or reacted when Zose spoke.
0,"This had been an arrangement between Zose, Basara, Kiri, and Byurk without her knowledge, perhaps because they knew she would refuse."
0,Zose and Basara had planned this from the beginning.
0,"They never asked for payment because they knew of the bounty and her identity the moment Basara saw her two tails, and they planned to claim a portion of the bounty as payment for their work."
0,Ceil could not speak ill of them.
0,"This was her fate, and she had no choice but to accept."
0,She could only hope that Byurk and Basara would be successful in convincing Jethro to spare her life as they promised.
0,Ceil’s eyes widened.
0,"She realized the crux of the plan, but it came too late for her to reply."
0,The Lord of the Afarit raised his hand after enduring Ceil’s long silence.
0,"Veins of fire extended from his neck, up his arm, and to his hand, a racial trait of the afarit commonly called ignition that enabled them to strengthen their bodies with fire."
0,"When his fingers curled to a fist, a flash lit for only a moment."
0,"All lights along the path extinguished, and the entourage marched back towards their city."
0,"“If you wish to take shelter from those who pursue you, the Afarit will welcome you, Ceil, but I cannot permit you to see the Guardian of Whinhlem."
0,For now.” He turned his back to Ceil and walked back down the path.
1,Ceil cursed herself for not realizing.
0,Kiri never abandoned her.
0,Neither had Zose nor Basara.
0,Their plan was a gamble relying on Ceil’s own ability.
0,"If she was successful in convincing Bydrofe to come to her aid against Tolmyur, then she would not be surrendered."
0,"The payment for the bounty, her surrender to Jethro, would only happen should she fail."
0,The Lord of the Afarit’s final words hinted that she might still have a chance to meet Bydrofe.
0,"Because of her silence, her task grew more difficult."
0,She both had to do whatever was needed to make that meeting occur and then be successful in persuading him to action.
0,Ceil grabbed Kiri’s shoulder and pulled her to her feet.
0,“Why did you not tell me your plan earlier?
0,"I made things worse not knowing,” she demanded in a harsh whisper."
0,"“Do not blame her,” Byurk said."
0,"“Kiri was opposed to the plan, and we felt you would be as well, so it was Zose, Basara, and my decision to keep it from you."
0,We do not plan on giving you to Jethro if it can be helped.”
0,"“But that all depends on me, does it not?”"
0,"“Yes,” Zose said, nudging Ceil forward."
0,"“For now, we have been allowed into the city."
0,We can rest for a few days.
0,"We will not get a regal welcome, but there is sure to be at least a small feast tomorrow in your honor.”"
0,"“Come,” Kiri said, walking down the dark path of the caldera’s steep slope towards the city."
0,* * *
1,"Back at Amel, Keeya contacted Jethro through his thoughts."
0,“I found her.
0,She has just been taken under the protection of the Afarit.”
0,"Jethro stood from the table, interrupting his dinner with his ten current and prospective officers."
0,"“The widow of Yuro has been located,” he announced to the confusion of those present."
0,"“How do you know,” Atson asked."
0,No message had come that any of them could see or hear.
0,“The Kissiae that took over Amel is cooperating with me.
0,She found her.”
0,Astonished glances traded across the table.
0,"Jethro had informed them that Keeya was not dangerous to them so long as they did not provoke her--in fact, he forbade anyone from approaching the ivy-covered walls of the fallen city to not risk antagonizing her--but none had even considered that the Kissiae would cooperate with them."
0,"To them, she was an enemy."
0,“Shall we organize the soldiers?” Captain Drommer asked.
0,"“Not yet, but inform the men that we may deploy at a moment’s notice and to be prepared."
0,I will return shortly.”
1,Jethro vanished and reappeared in the west garden of the Amelian Palace atop a barrier suspended in the air so that his transmission would not damage Keeya’s vines.
0,He sat down cross-legged on the mound of Ivy beside Keeya.
0,“That was faster than I thought.
0,You said it would take time.”
0,"“Had she gone into hiding in some remote hovel, it might have.”"
0,"“The safest location for her in all the wilderlands is the Afarit, so you assumed she would head there?”"
0,Keeya nodded in unison with Emer’s unconscious head.
0,“I searched the road north from Ib’nua and found her the moment she entered the city.”
0,Jethro extended his hand.
0,“Can you give me her location?”
0,"“Yes, but you alone will be insufficient."
0,"She is in the presence of a powerful guard, and your past awaits you there.”"
0,“What do you mean?”
0,"“Byurk, and by his actions, he is cooperating with her.”"
0,“A prisoner?”
0,“No.
0,He is not bound nor is he under watch.
0,You know he dislikes the war and the task you gave him.
0,He may have betrayed you.”
0,Jethro sat in thought with his arms crossed.
0,"Of all those from his mercenary days, Byurk alone remained most loyal to him."
0,"He doubted Byurk would ever betray him, but he could not be certain."
0,There was more at play than Jethro knew.
0,That could be the only answer.
0,But Byurk was not part of Jethro’s past--he was a current captain under Jethro’s command--so Keeya’s warning made little sense.
0,"“Basara also personally guards her,” Keeya said, knowing Jethro’s thoughts."
0,Now Jethro made the connection.
0,"Both Byurk and Basara were members of his hunter mercenary party, and it appeared that they were cooperating together."
0,"“From your memory, she is equal to you in power, but that was over a year ago."
0,There is no telling who of you the stronger now is.
0,"In addition, a pack of lycon--”"
0,"Jethro’s mind flashed to the smiling memory of his wife, a caring and compassionate woman who endured hardship with love, the woman to whom he was eternally bound both in life and death, one who was part lycon."
0,"“--ould you remove your feelings and kill lycon to capture her?” Keeya continued, although Jethro missed part of her explanation."
0,"For the first time, she saw mild distress in Jethro’s eyes."
0,"“To kill the one you seek, you may have to kill your longing for your past."
0,Can you?”
0,Chapter 21
0,“Cold Feet in Warm Waters”
1,The Afarit were a peculiar people.
0,"Although they lived in the ruins of the ancient city, they did not seem to live there."
0,They did not decorate nor adorn their chosen abodes.
0,They never embellished the ruins of their city as Revlan had.
0,"Their attitude towards the ruins of the ancient civilization was one of reverence, not reform."
0,They slept where the ground and ruins enabled them to do so.
0,They cooked communally in open clearings that had existed from ancient days.
0,"Sparse arid plants grew freely in the soil where nature let their roots take hold, and those that were edible were nourished to be harvested where they held."
0,Not even a single stone that had crumbled onto the road long ago was moved from where it lay.
0,"Where dryads lived in harmony with nature, the Afarit lived in harmony with the past."
0,"The city ruins grew in size and density as it neared the center, becoming a crumbling maze of shattered ruin along the many tiers of the city."
0,Only the widest of roads remained clear enough to walk.
0,"The heat grew the closer to the city center that Ceil, Justin, Chloe, and Basara walked despite being in the shade of the towering earthen crown."
0,The ruins never touched the crown but crumbled into a deep crevice of molten lava over three-hundred yards wide from steep cliff to steep cliff.
0,"The river of fire itself was not even a quarter the width, but the crevice was such a staggering depth that on the night before when standing on the edge of the caldera the glow was not visible."
0,At least that kept the heat from growing as unbearable as the fire wastes.
0,"“No one knows at what point the Afarit came to claim the ruins after the fall of the ancient civilization, but their community is many times older than the Amelian Empire,” Basara said as she showed them where they could wash, find food, and barter for basic necessities."
0,"“I fled here before I was even a year old,” she explained at length when Justin grew curious about how Basara knew her way around the city so well."
0,“When other maenads learned that my mother was harboring a human--my father--they came for him.
0,"Like all nymphs, males are very rare among maenads."
0,"In a fit of jealousy and rage, my mother killed my father before other maenads could claim him."
0,I was young at the time and had no control of my emotions either.
0,"I had an unhealthy infatuation with my father, so I killed my mother in revenge and fled."
0,"The Afarit took me in and taught me how to survive, and once I could manage on my own, I lived as a hunter mercenary ever since.”"
0,Basara chuckled lightly.
0,"“I did not understand my mother’s feelings back then, but now that I have Zose, I do."
0,I would never let anyone take him from me.”
0,"“Would you do the same as your mother?” Ceil asked, mildly worried for Zose."
0,“Never.” Basara’s lips widened into a sly grin.
0,“I only have to kill the other party trying to claim him.”
0,Chloe chuckled.
0,"“When did you first meet Jethro,” Ceil asked as she picked through ornamental tassels arrayed on leather spread across the ground."
1,"“This matches your hair,” the elderly craftswoman said in broken Elven as she lifted an intricate braid of wheat-blond hair with interwoven darkwood beads and red-dyed feathers."
0,"Ceil retrieved it, and after inspecting it lightly, she set it back on the leather."
0,"She had nothing to barter, and she felt such adornments were wasted on her, but her interest in the ornament did not go unnoticed."
0,"“A gift,” the woman stated, lifting the braid to Ceil again."
0,Chloe quickly thanked the woman and claimed the braid.
0,"When Ceil thought Chloe would tie it to her own hair, thinking it fit Chloe far better, Chloe tied the cord high around a lock of hair on the side of Ceil’s head letting it dangle in front of her ear."
0,Basara then knelt before the woman and cut a lock off the end of her own hair about six inches in length to give back to the woman.
0,"As the hair sat in the woman’s hands, it faded to pristine white like a perfect diamond."
0,The woman encased the hair gently in her fingers and brought it to her chest with a bowed head.
1,"“I thought the tassel was a gift,” Ceil said as they continued walking."
0,She toyed with her tassel between her fingers as she spoke.
0,"“She never expected a gift in return,” Basara explained, “but by giving her a lock of nymph hair, she could create an ornament of far greater appeal than the one she gifted, showing to her that our gratitude for the beauty of her gift was far greater than how she originally valued it."
0,"To the Afarit, gifts increase in value through giving."
0,"By giving that tassel to you, her hope was that it would no longer be an item to be bartered but something you would treasure, and perhaps at some point in the future you would pass it to another, telling the tale from whence it came, its value increasing even further through the growth of its own history."
0,There could be no greater joy for a craftsperson of the Afarit.
0,"I expect that once she creates an ornament from my hair, she will give it to another without requesting payment, passing my gift forward.”"
0,"“For all the talk of tribute and payment yesterday, I had thought they would be far more materialistic,” Ceil replied."
0,Basara smiled warmly.
0,“Have you seen a single grain of gold or precious metal in all the city?
0,"No, the tribute is not to increase the wealth of the Afarit nor does it reach Bydrofe."
0,"The Guardian of Whinhlem has no need for material possessions, and the values of the Afarit differ greatly from other materialistic races."
0,The entire purpose of the tribute is to show how much you personally are willing to sacrifice for the honor of meeting Bydrofe.
0,"That is why we thought to use the bounty, because although the treasures of Amel are no longer yours to give, for them to claim it, you would need to surrender yourself to your enemy to imprisonment, torture, and possible death."
0,There is no greater gift than your own life for the opportunity to meet Bydrofe.
0,"Also, by Zose and me relinquishing our collection of your bounty and Byurk’s willingness to use the bounty to allow you to meet Bydrofe in betrayal of his own nation, we are showing the level of our own convictions on your behalf."
0,"“However, you must be careful with your offering."
0,"If you offer your life for the opportunity to meet with Bydrofe, Hain-henel will comply by killing you once you return."
0,"An agreement is binding to the Afarit, and it can never be rescinded."
0,"Should you gain the opportunity to speak with Bydrofe by offering yourself to Tolmyur, the Afarit will personally see to it that you are surrendered to them."
0,"Should you resist in any way, this city will become your enemy."
0,Only Bydrofe himself can free you from your payment.”
0,"“I see…” Ceil realized that had she answered Lord Hain-henel with conviction, he might have given permission immediately."
0,His final statement was likely to say Ceil still had time to prove how much she desired to meet Bydrofe.
0,Her first task was finding how to prove it.
0,She did not want to surrender herself to Jethro if she could avoid it.
0,"Another payment was preferable, but she had nothing else to offer but her life."
0,"“And about your question concerting Jethro,” Basara began, but Ceil cut her off."
0,“It is fine.
0,"Had you desired to answer it, you would have already."
0,I was foolish to ask.”
0,"“Thank you,” Basara replied, breathing slowly and deep with sorrow tinting her eyes."
1,"“Is that the feast preparations?” Justin asked in English looking ahead to a large, rectangular, city square sat at the edge of the deep ravine."
0,The space was open save eleven pillars unique and distinct from each other that dotted an inner circumference.
0,A small rectangular altar sat atop a low circular platform on the side facing the ravine.
0,Byurk stood alone by the alter inspecting it while two rather tall afarit stood guard.
0,No small number of Afarit was arranging woven baskets on large rugs.
0,"Others lined pillows of a myriad of colors on the largest of the rugs, coordinating colors and patterns of both the rugs and cushions."
0,"Seven large bonfires lit one after another, and the rare and extremely valuable wood quickly succumbed to the heat of the flames, creating beautifully black coals under the management of skilled firekeepers."
0,The coals were then cooled to wait for the moment the meal would be prepared.
0,The lingering smoke in the air bore a hardy flavor that Ceil imagined would beautifully season whatever was cooked above the coals.
0,Metal grates were sat atop the coals balanced in the corners by intricately carved ceremonial stones.
0,None took notice of Ceil’s party watching the arrangements at length and kept to their individual tasks as if unnaturally compelled for excellence.
0,"“The welcome will be grander than I expected,” Basara said with mild joy."
0,"“You are the late emperor’s widow, so it must be out of respect for your connection as a member of the family possessing the longest-held contract with the Afarit of all the races on the continent.”"
0,“How long has Amel been pilgrimaging to meet Bydrofe?” Ceil asked.
0,“It is never much of a pilgrimage.
0,"From what I know, the royal family simply teleports directly to the rim of the caldera."
0,You might be the first of the house of Amel since before the founding of the empire to walk here.”
0,“Amel has been meeting Bydrofe before the empire was created?” Chloe asked.
0,“I am not too sure of all the history.
0,"A single man, Amel, was the first among the elves to meet Bydrofe and gained favor with him, eventually leading to the establishment of the Amelian Empire after several generations.”"
0,"“The Amelian Empire was created because of Bydrofe?” Justin asked, amazed."
0,"“No, the Amelian Alliance was first created out of fear of the humans that once held the more fertile territories now owned by the elves."
0,"Alone, the humans were too great, but with the combined strength of the elves, trolls, spriggans, fairies, sirens, pixies, and dryads, the balance of power swayed far into the alliance’s favor."
0,"It is my speculation that the elves created the alliance with the intent of eventually driving the humans from the more fertile lands, because it was they alone who did so."
0,Some of the other races in the alliance even supported letting the humans join the alliance or were otherwise opposed to the elven aggression.
0,The humans could not fight back for fear of the overwhelming power of the alliance crushing them outright.
0,Not long after the humans were driven out and the bounty of their lands was claimed by the elves did the elves gain enough power to found an empire with the Amel house at the head.”
0,"The light of realization lit behind Justin and Chloe’s eyes, making Ceil nervous."
0,"She knew in part of this history from what Basara had already told her but held it back from Justin and Chloe, unsure how they would react if they learned the truth."
0,Guilt weighed on her heart.
0,"“Tolmyur can hold quite a grudge,” Justin said in English with a mournful glance at Ceil."
0,He too realized that there was little need for such a longstanding hate between the two nations if it happened so long ago in ages past.
0,Ceil’s heart felt ease knowing her friends would not blame her for the crimes of her ancestors.
0,“Do you know who was opposed to the elves attacking the humans?” Justin asked Basara.
0,"“Not for certain,” Basara admitted, “but I do know the trolls and sirens supported the invasion with food and other resources."
0,"Once the empire was formed, the sirens were rewarded the freshwater sea in the southern empire, and the trolls were given the verdant mountains south of Fiorrae so that they no longer had to struggle for survival in the volcanic lands at the west of the empire.”"
0,“Why is Jethro after Ceil?” Chloe asked.
0,"“She was the emperor’s wife, but the empire is gone.”"
0,"“Jethro was wronged by the royal family,” Basara explained simply."
0,"“His is a personal grudge, and with his power and influence, he brought all of Tolmyur into it, feeding Tolmyur’s festering anger at the Coastal War and past grievances."
0,"I fear that until all the royal family is gone, he will not relent."
0,"Ceil is a victim of the current Amelian family, just like Jethro is."
0,I wish he knew this.”
0,“Is there no way to reconcile?” Ceil asked.
0,“I do not even know how Jethro was wronged.”
0,"Basara held her hand to her mouth as if ill, and for the first time Ceil saw in the powerful woman a flicker of weakness."
0,"Basara knew, and the knowledge of what transpired troubled Basara deeply."
0,Ceil’s heart sank.
0,"She understood that look, the faint pain in Basara’s eyes."
0,"“You… You feel Jethro’s actions are justified,” Ceil spoke softly."
0,Basara breathed slow and deep.
0,"“No, that is not completely true."
0,"I support his actions against the royal family and would even have aided him in claiming the head of the first princess, but he has taken this war too far, and he has no reason to target your life.”"
0,“What did Eydis do!
0,"?” Ceil screamed, but Basara remained silent, aggravating Ceil further."
0,"“If you will not tell me, I will order Byurk to explain everything.”"
0,"Ceil marched off with Chloe and Justin quickly following, trying to calm her down."
0,Basara leaned back against the crumbling wall along the border of the open square.
0,"She felt guilty keeping silent, but she could not allow Ceil to waver here."
0,"Jethro would not stop, and any sympathy from Ceil would only make her capture or death easier for him to accomplish."
0,She breathed out a long sigh.
1,"Two arms appeared from the wall and wrapped gently around her, and Zose’s head popped out to rest on her shoulder."
0,"“You are far too considerate at times,” he said, leaning his cheek against hers."
0,"Basara pulled Zose out from the wall, and he stood beside her, their arms interlocked."
0,“Ceil will find no answers from Byurk.
0,"I alone know the truth, unless Jethro and Byurk’s mutual trust had grown substantially in the time I have been away."
0,It is not something Jethro would ever talk about unless absolutely necessary.
0,I doubt he has revealed the truth to anyone.”
0,“Can you tell me?”
0,Basara leaned over and whispered into Zose’s ear.
0,"Zose’s back slid down the wall until he sat on the rough, arid grass, his elbows on his knees and his fingers irritably massaging his temples."
0,“Ceil can never learn of this.
0,She worships Eydis.
0,"If this is the truth, it would destroy her.”"
0,* * *
1,“Your holiday is over.
0,The time for rest has passed.
0,This is your final chance to prove yourself.
0,We capture that cowardly widow tonight!”
0,Jethro watched as Captain Mackrum inspired the soldiers as about fifty-thousand prepared for departure.
0,"The former lieutenant was yet too inexperienced to be a captain, but with the need for leadership, Jethro trusted he would grow into his role."
0,“Are you sure you do not want to send the army into the Afarit?” Keeya asked in Jethro’s mind.
0,She had originally volunteered to send his army directly into the city.
0,"“No, the perimeter is fine."
0,We do not have the power to come as invaders.
0,We will announce our arrival like all others must.”
0,“The widow may flee.”
0,“I do not think so.
0,"She has not met Bydrofe yet, correct?"
0,"If she flees into hiding, she will lose her chance."
0,And I trust you can find her if she does.
0,She can no longer hide from us.
0,The pursuit ends tonight.”
0,“Are you sure you are able to do what is needed?”
0,"“Yes,” Jethro answered without any waver in his conviction."
0,"“When my soldiers are ready, I will send them to the city walls for you to teleport them to the borders of the Afarit.”"
0,“Act quickly.
0,You cannot let the widow convince Bydrofe to act against you.
0,"No matter what you do or what happens, you must avoid meeting Bydrofe.”"
0,Jethro felt an immense pressure from Keeya’s final words.
0,This was not a warning but an order.
0,* * *
1,Ceil sat disgruntled on a thick rug in the festive square.
0,"She learned nothing from Byurk, and she had no way to know if he simply did not know about what Eydis did to Jethro or if he refused to answer her inquiry."
0,"“Don’t worry about it,” Chloe beamed."
0,“We know Eydis is not the type of person to do something atrocious.
0,Enjoy the party.” She passed a goblet of chilled wine into Ceil’s hands.
0,There was no ceremony to the feast.
0,"No welcome was held, and Ceil was not presented before the people."
0,"The party was simply a banquet where a couple hundred Afarit gathered to eat, converse, and dance around the numerous pillars of the square."
0,The only courtesies shown to Ceil and her group were higher-quality rugs and cushions and their own personal fire pit and firekeeper to provide food.
0,"“You are a guest, not royalty,” Zose had explained just before the feast began."
0,Ceil eyed the wine in her chilled goblet.
0,"She had already eaten her fill, so there was little else to do but imbibe a little here and there."
0,"Like the land, the wine had a sharp fire even when cold while simultaneously being soothingly warm and smooth."
0,It was quite the confusing mix.
0,"“It’s like if cayenne and cinnamon had a baby,” Justin said when he took a sip after seeing Ceil’s perplexed reaction to the drink."
0,"“Your explanation means nothing to me when you use words unique to your world,” Ceil replied."
0,She took another sip.
0,“Do not pass out early this time.
0,I prefer to have a conversation partner.”
0,"Justin smiled ruefully, remembering how quickly he succumbed to wine at the lycon feast."
0,"“How about you go dance,” Chloe suggested, pointing to the nearest pillar crafted like stacked spheres wound in stone vines; although the top had long fractured and was lost to time, so no one could know what the top of the pillar once looked like."
0,"“You can feel free,” Ceil replied after another light sip."
0,Chloe smiled and shook her head.
0,"She stood and grabbed Benab’s hand, pulling him away from his meal."
0,"As Chloe passed Justin, Ceil heard her whisper, “get her to dance,” before dragging the startled spriggan to the pillar."
0,"“I am fine without dancing,” Ceil told Justin before he could muster any thoughts towards that end."
0,"“She means well,” he replied."
0,“I know that much.”
0,They watched Chloe stumble over the intricate taps and stamps to the hollow stone drums and bone and metal flutes.
0,The upbeat yet eerie tune carried well over the banquet clamor.
0,Benab knew the dance and instructed Chloe for the woman’s part.
0,"In further bewilderment, Ceil watched as Chloe picked up the rhythm all too quickly."
0,“Is there anything she cannot do?”
0,Justin only smiled.
0,"Ceil watched Chloe’s vibrancy as she spun, changed partners, and fully enjoyed the festivities."
0,"But the longer she watched, the more she noticed a hollow emptiness to Chloe’s smile like a hidden pain."
0,"It was then that she realized she had seen this before, what felt like forever ago back in Lemi’s village."
0,Chloe wrestled with the Melian children to put her mind and heart at ease or perhaps to draw her thoughts away from her troubles and worries about arriving in a new and unfamiliar world.
0,"Back then, Ceil questioned if she should join Chloe in wrestling with the children."
0,"Again, she questioned if she personally had the right to partake in any form of joy."
0,She looked to the side.
0,"Justin too was smiling, but the pain she saw behind the façade was much deeper than Chloe’s."
0,She did not take long to think of the reason.
0,"If Sammy was here, she would have pulled Justin in to dance."
0,"If Eydis was here, she might have asked Justin to dance."
0,"Guilt gripped tight in Ceil’s chest, and anxiety made her back shiver despite the drowning heat."
0,"Her hand shook, but in a burst of will, she grabbed Justin’s wrist and pulled him to his feet."
0,"“Dance with me,” Ceil said, much to Justin’s astonishment."
0,She pulled Justin not to the nearest pillar but the one beside it with the fewest dancers near the circular platform and altar.
0,They stood a bit further off to not be in the way of the other dancers.
0,"The heat from the nearby crevice was a bit stronger, making Ceil sweat, or perhaps the reason for her sweating was her anxiety."
0,"She did not want to do this, but she knew she would feel worse had she done nothing after seeing Justin watching the pairs dance."
0,Ceil swallowed her inhibitions and positioned Justin in front of her.
0,"“This is one of the oldest dances, so most everyone knows it."
0,The beat is three-five-three-seven-three-five-seven.
0,"For the masculine part, the steps for the three-beats are syncopated,” she explained quickly, hoping that Justin would understand without her needing to explain further."
0,Justin’s confusion was directed not at the complicated stepping but something unrelated to the dance.
0,“How did you learn English?
0,How do you know what syncopated means?
0,I doubt Eydis in all her studying ever encountered that word.”
0,"“Its translation is a common word in Elven,” Ceil began to explain, but her voice trailed off."
0,"After a moment of silence, she continued."
0,"“I did not realize until Sammy could speak every language that the reason I understood the sprite tongue, English, so well was likely because the Sprite Arkhon did the same to me as he did to her, but only for English and slowly over time so I wouldn’t notice."
0,He probably did that so I could speak with Sammy and Chloe and you when you all arrived.
0,"They knew you would come to Fiorrae, after all."
0,"Now that I think about it, Eydis learned the sprite tongue, but it did not sound like English."
0,Perhaps they only started speaking English once I arrived in Fiorrae.
0,That is certainly something the Sprite Arkhon would do.”
0,Ceil’s eyes diverted from Justin and caught Chloe and Benab watching them.
0,Chloe smiled and turned back to continue dancing.
0,“Enough of that.
0,Back to the explanation.” She showed Justin the masculine stamps and movements first and then had him repeat.
0,"When he repeated, she answered with the feminine accompaniment."
0,"Justin’s skill was horrid, and Ceil did little to hide the frustration leaking onto her face."
0,"“Sorry,” Justin said."
0,“I have two left feet.”
0,"“An odd phrasing,” Ceil replied as she showed him his part once again."
0,“I assume it comes from stepping with your left foot when you should your right?”
0,"“I think that’s where it comes from,” Justin smirked, finally succeeding in his first syncopated stamp."
0,Ceil nodded in approval.
0,They could now at least dance in part.
0,"Ceil watched the other dancers in-between instructions and could not help but notice the joy on everyone’s face, joy she did not feel in return."
0,"The music was a little different, mostly in instrumentation, but the dance was still the same as what was used during festivals at her childhood village."
0,Her mother taught her the dance almost as soon as she could walk.
0,"Festivals were a reason for merriment amid the hardships caused by the drought, even if there was no reason for celebration due to the lack of a harvest."
0,"Still, Ceil had vivid memories of the genuine smiles of the villagers."
0,Everyone forgot about the drought for an evening and danced their sorrows away.
0,"Even now, Ceil felt the calm that accompanied nostalgia, brought upon by the festivities."
0,"“Is there a similar saying to ‘two left feet’ in Elven?” Justin asked after noticing a small change in Ceil’s demeanor, hoping to get her to speak more and open up."
0,“Hilm-mer-fer-mel.
0,It is a nonsensical label roughly meaning ‘to mistake one’s tail for one’s leg.’”
0,Justin laughed lightly.
0,"They finished their first full pattern, and Ceil nodded again in mild approval."
0,"“Sounds like someone falling backwards,” Justin continued."
0,"“The label is usually meant for someone who is clumsy and trips often, but it is also applied to those poor at dance.”"
0,"Just as Ceil finished speaking, Justin missed a step and tripped over Ceil’s leg as she extended it to where Justin should have cleared."
0,He fell on his butt and shook his head.
0,"“I don’t have a tail, so what does this make me?”"
1,"A swift breath escaped Ceil’s lips, almost a hiccup, but when Ceil realized that it was the faintest of a chuckle, she felt as if a knife was plunged into her heart."
0,"She stepped back as guilt weighed on the knife, driving it deeper."
0,Her body shook with unrestrained anxiety.
0,Tears fell down her cheeks.
0,She receded further and then fled.
0,"“Ceil!” Justin called, greatly confused, but Chloe was there beside him before he could chase."
0,"“You were perfect,” she said, patting him once on the shoulder."
0,“Leave the rest to me.”
0,Ceil did not know where to run or why she was even running.
0,Her arms stiffened around her chest.
0,"A painful tingle spread across her shoulders, neck and back."
0,She quickly jumped up a crumbling wall to the empty second story of one of the ruins where most of the floor aside from near the walls had long crumbled.
0,"She sat in a dark corner and tried to calm down, but her efforts only made her breathing grow more erratic."
0,"She began to hyperventilate, and before she could suppress the sudden onset of nausea, she vomited on the floor in front of her."
0,"She did not know what was wrong with her, and that fear broke out the first of many silent and strained sobs."
0,"Her arms felt locked, crossed over her chest, and she could not move them."
0,"She curled over, staring at her sick unable to do anything more than cry."
0,"“Ceil,” Chloe called as she struggled to climb the wall Ceil had so nimbly scaled."
0,"When she saw Ceil’s pitiful state, she rushed over."
0,"“Sorry, I did not think you would be this bad.”"
0,“What were you trying to accomplish!
0,"?” Ceil squealed, barely able to finish her statement before vomiting again."
0,“I only wanted you to have some fun.
0,I didn’t think you would react that way…” Chloe knelt down beside Ceil and held back her hair.
0,"“Breathe slowly, in then out."
0,Follow me.
0,"In, then out.”"
0,Ceil resisted Chloe’s coaching at first but slowly and after some time she managed to control her hyperventilation.
0,"“I do not deserve fun… or happiness,” she finally said as her mind began to clear, but her words twisted the knife in her heart, bringing back the tears and sobs she fought to keep from escaping."
0,“Of course you do!” Chloe scolded.
0,"“You have as much right as anyone, especially after everything you’ve been through.”"
0,“Everything that has happened because of me--” Ceil began but cut herself off knowing Chloe would just counter by saying none of it was her fault.
0,"“If happiness feels this horrible now, I do not want it…”"
0,"Chloe gently rubbed Ceil’s back as Ceil knelt, bent over like a wilted reed."
0,"“Like dipping your frozen toes in warm water,” she replied."
0,"“When in the cold for so long, your toes grow numb."
0,You can’t really feel it because you get used to the numbness.
0,"Afterwards when you dip them in warm water, they hurt a lot."
0,"The sting might be unbearable at first, but the thing is, the cold is harmful and the warm water, even though it hurts, is healthy."
0,And it only hurts at first.
0,"Once you get used to the warmth again, it feels good.”"
0,Ceil understood quickly.
0,“You wanted Justin to be the warm water.”
0,"“I wanted the dancing to be, sort of."
0,I wanted you to do something fun.
0,"It’s just that when Sammy and Justin were together in the past, she would always talk about how Justin had this knack for spontaneously making her laugh because of how awkward or clumsy he is."
0,I thought putting him and dancing together would be enough to make you smile… and you did.”
0,Ceil lifted her head and looked up at Chloe.
0,Chloe’s smile was warm like a loving mother.
0,“There is nothing wrong with being happy.
0,"In fact, you need happiness more now than ever."
0,That’s all I was trying to do.
0,Sorry for making you uncomfortable.
0,Are you okay now?”
0,Ceil assessed her breathing.
0,"Her nausea had passed, and the pain was gone."
0,Whatever emotional trauma her body broke under was over for now.
0,“We should return to the banquet before others worry.
0,Here.” Chloe lifted the hem of her gown and was about to wipe Ceil’s mouth.
0,"“No, do not soil Basara’s gown like that,” Ceil quickly warned, knowing Basara’s distaste for anything filthy."
0,She undid her bind in the back and used the end of the thin cloth to wipe her face.
0,"A spark flashed above the empty, broken floor, and a wisp of flame appeared hovering in the air."
0,It quickly took the form of a small body.
0,"“An emergency,” a sharp tenor voice called."
0,“Jethro is in the Afarit!”
0,“A flame sprite?” Chloe asked in shock.
0,“Jethro is here?” Ceil shouted back.
0,"In the distance at the rim of the caldera visible from almost anywhere in the city except the lowest tiers, a flare burst into yellow and green."
0,"“Tolmyur’s colors,” Ceil said with fear tinting her voice."
0,A deal had not yet been struck with the Afarit.
0,She needed to meet Bydrofe now.
0,* * *
1,"Back in Fiorrae, the sprites were in a panic."
0,“Jethro was never supposed to be there.
0,Why did we not see it?” One sprite asked.
0,“Wasn’t he supposed to still be on Earth?” Another followed.
0,"The panic spread to the children rescued from Vallen, and a small number of the youngest began crying."
0,"“She held him as long as she could without causing greater interference with our predictions,” the Arkhon replied, seemingly unperturbed compared to the other sprites around him."
0,"“But we are already blind,” Ephora retorted."
0,"“Because you told them that Jethro was vital for the future,” the Arkhon quipped."
0,“She did not want to make it worse.”
0,“Why do you seem so happy about this?” Ephora found the Arkhon’s twisted smile sickening.
0,"“How can you take independent action without consequence, but I cannot?”"
0,"“I am still bound by the same laws as you,”  he laughed."
0,“Most of my interference is in preparation for futures we do not see.”
0,"“But if we do not see them, then they shouldn’t happen,” Ephora grumbled."
0,"“How did this happen, and how did we not see it before my blunder?”"
0,“Can you think of nothing?”
0,"Ephora’s eyes narrowed, and she vanished."
0,The Arkhon followed and appeared in a grove with the remains of a body suspended in the air.
0,"The skeletal structure of a human was at its core, but the rest of the body was perfectly dissected, each piece of tissue down to the individual nerves were separated and suspended as if in a cloud of flesh."
0,"“Sammy is dead,” Ephora protested once the Arkhon arrived."
0,"“She could not have caused this.” Every day since Sammy’s corpse was brought to Fiorrae, Ephora had examined the body for clues as to why Sammy was invisible to sprite foresight, but so far, she had found nothing."
0,“The answer is quite simple.
0,"Not only are her immediate actions invisible to us, but the expanding ripples of those actions too remain unseen."
0,"Think, what is the largest difference between our current present and what we had predicted?”"
0,"“Keeya is a hamadryad,” Ephora realized quickly."
0,“She helped Jethro find Ceil.”
0,"“Exactly,” the Arkhon exclaimed gleefully."
0,“You knew this would happen!
0,What are you plotting!
0,"“Nothing, if you will believe me."
0,I am simply curious how this will all unfold.”
0,"“You are lying,” Ephora said with a glare, her hands on her hips."
0,The Arkhon spread his arms in a welcoming gesture.
0,“Read me.
0,I will hide nothing.”
0,"“I refuse,” Ephora replied."
0,“One of your power could devour me if I tried.”
0,"“I would hardly do something so uncouth,” the Arkhon laughed."
0,"“In any case, we have no choice but to see how Jethro’s involvement in the Afarit changes things."
0,I am hoping for a good show.”
0,Chapter 22
0,“The Beckoning of Death”
1,Zose appeared from the wall beside Ceil shortly after the fire sprite’s announcement of Jethro’s arrival.
0,"“Zose, I must meet with Hain-henel,” Ceil said after her brief surprise."
0,“Where is he?”
0,"“You must get armored first,” Zose ordered."
0,“I did not expect Tolmyur to be here for another thirty-two days at least.
0,"If Tolmyur is here, Jethro might be also.”"
0,“He is.
0,"This sprite told me,” Ceil said, but when she turned back to the sprite, he was gone."
0,"“I must speak with Hain-henel,” she repeated."
0,Zose pulled Ceil to where the outer wall had crumbled and helped her down.
0,Chloe slowly followed.
0,"“Tolmyur does not have a visitation agreement with the Afarit, so they might conduct business with them at the perimeter for a time.”"
0,"“I will speak with Hain-henel during that time,” Ceil answered."
1,They returned to the large square to see it far more crowded than before.
0,The music and dancing had ceased.
0,Already a procession was starting from the south end of the square as Afarit lined the wide road lighting flames in their hands.
0,Ceil realized that this square was the origin of the lit path she saw upon her arrival.
0,"At the back of the square, Hain-henel stood by the altar."
0,Ceil broke from Zose’s grasp and weaved her way through the dense crowd.
0,Zose sank into the ground to follow after her while Chloe met up with Justin to explain what happened.
0,"“Lord Hain-henel,” Ceil called."
0,"She bowed when she approached, using that time to think of something she could say or offer to him to prove her conviction to meet Bydrofe."
0,Nothing came to mind other than Zose and Basara’s original plan.
0,"It was all she had, so it was all she could give."
0,“I must meet with Bydrofe.
0,"I will offer myself to Tolmyur after, but you must let me see him before Jethro enters the city.”"
0,"“When a guest calls, we answer without delay."
0,"We must abide our laws,” Hain-henel replied without care for Ceil’s plight."
0,Zose rose from the ground beside Ceil.
0,"“Lord, you must understand, if Tolmyur enters the city, they will claim Ceil before she has a chance."
0,Jethro is here for her.”
0,Ceil looked behind and saw that the procession was already near the border of the city as more and more lights dotted the road in the distance.
0,Soon they would climb the miles of slope up to the rim of the caldera.
0,Hain-henel stepped down from the circular platform and took his place at the back of the procession.
0,"“Is there no way we can reach an agreement,” Zose pleaded."
0,"Hain-henel looked back to Zose, his eyes unwavering."
0,“Did you send word to Tolmyur that Ceil would be here for them to claim?”
0,"“I did, but for the purpose of using that agreement as compensation for Ceil’s audience with the Guardian of Whinhlem.”"
0,“Do they know of this?”
0,"“No,” Zose replied honestly."
0,"“Whatever your true purpose may have been, you entered a contract with Tolmyur to present Ceil, and you must abide.” Without further argument, Hain-henel followed the back of the procession through the square."
1,Ceil paced pensively around the altar.
0,“Is there another way to meet him?
0,How do the Afarit arrange a meeting?”
0,"“The pathway must be opened by Hain-henel or the Guardian of Whinhlem himself,” one of the large Afarit guarding the altar replied."
0,“None else knows the way.”
0,"“The altar is the entrance, but no one knows how to use it but them,” Byurk said as he hopped up onto the circular platform."
0,He awkwardly carried Ceil’s plated jack under his arm and handed it to Zose.
0,"“They let me freely inspect it earlier, but I was not able to understand it."
0,"I have only seen one such alter before in Melia, but it was in a far worse state."
0,"There are ven channels woven through the stone, so I expect it is an enchantment of some form."
0,Few have learned the craft.
0,I tried channeling my ven into it but to no effect.
0,Jethro might be the only other who could understand it.”
0,"“And that is not an option,” Zose replied as he finished lacing up Ceil’s jack."
0,"The thick fabric was unbearable in the heat, but Ceil understood that the resfahil plates interlaced within were her only true protection."
0,“Do I hide?” Ceil asked.
0,“I doubt that will be possible.
0,"The Afarit know I sent for Tolmyur, and they will require me to surrender you to them."
0,"If I betray that agreement, we make enemies of the city."
0,Agreements are binding here.”
0,Basara arrived with the rest of their party.
0,"The Lycon took stance, surrounding the circular platform in the now far less crowded square to guard Ceil."
0,"Chloe took her place in front, ready to fight for her friend if needed, and Justin stood beside Ceil to activate his time magic at a moment’s notice."
0,"Thanysa, Hethyro, and the last High Elf stood at the head of the lycon perimeter."
0,"Benab was missing, but Ceil understood that he was likely hidden in one of the nearby ruins to make use of his archery."
0,"Kiri, her faintly glowing translucent wings unfurled, hovered above the group to spy out threats from her higher vantage."
0,They would protect Ceil no matter the cost.
0,"“Once Jethro is welcomed into the city, I will speak to him first on your behalf,” Byurk said."
0,"He jumped down from the altar and stood at the end of the procession, not far in front of Chloe."
0,The few remaining soldiers under his command followed.
0,“Is it smart to let him speak first?” Justin asked.
0,"“I do not know,” Ceil replied."
0,"She was unsure how much she could trust Byurk now that his commander had arrived, but Basara did not speak against his proposal, so perhaps his intentions were true."
0,"From the side of the square, a pair of afarit  escorted Benab to the altar platform from wherever he was perched, and another led both Tyree and Tae as well."
0,It seemed that all in Ceil’s party must be present for the discussions.
0,Both Benab and Tae’s bows had been confiscated but were returned once they reached the platform.
0,The afarit would allow no hidden threats.
0,"Unlike the quick extinguishing of the lights when Ceil failed to satisfy Hain-henel’s demands for proof of her conviction, the lights at the tip of the path to the city flew into the air one-by-one as Tolmyur was led to the city."
0,"Whatever the conversation had been, a deal was struck between Jethro and Hain-henel."
0,"Ceil watched in agonizing anticipation, unsure of what would unfold should they meet."
0,She had only seen Jethro once before.
0,Memories of his brutal execution of the young girl posing as her in the Gallanvale repeated over and over in her mind.
0,"Basara professed Jethro mad, and how could anyone confront or reason with a madman who held such power?"
0,Ceil felt a chilling grip on her shoulder.
0,The skeletal hand returned and beckoned her to use his power.
0,"She shook the horrid vision from her mind, but the overwhelming anxiety never faded."
0,It only grew stronger.
0,"She would soon meet her enemy from whom she had fled all these many days, and enemy whom even if she had the power to kill, she could not, because his survival was necessary to the future, just like hers."
0,"The approaching horde was like a death march, the rhythmic steps of the thousands of soldiers now entering the city like the grinding of an executioner sharpening his blade."
0,Ceil wanted to run.
0,Every nerve in her body told her to run.
0,She no longer had time to meet Bydrofe.
0,She would be handed over to Jethro to death or worse at the hands of his men.
0,Justin steadied Ceil’s trembling hand.
0,"“I won’t let him have you,” he said without a waver in his voice."
0,“None of us will.”
0,"Instead of comfort, Justin’s words terrified her more."
0,He did not hear the exchange between Zose and Hain-henel.
0,"If Justin or Chloe or anyone protected her, not only Tolmyur but all the Afarit would rise against them."
0,She was not protected in a city surrounded by multiple stone walls like Revlan.
0,She no longer had an army to guard her.
0,Ceil knew that hope had faded and was lost.
0,Her greatest fears were a repeat of Sammy’s sacrifice.
0,All those promising to protect her would die.
0,"“If I must surrender myself to Jethro, do not interfere,” she ordered Justin."
0,“He is here for me alone to satisfy Zose’s agreement to collect the bounty.
0,"So long as you do not act, I do not think the Afarit will let anyone else come to harm.”"
0,“You know I cannot--”
0,"“This is not like it was in Revlan,” Ceil hissed."
0,“Please.
0,"I cannot lose anyone else… Not Chloe, or you."
0,Byurk and Basara will convince him not to kill… me…”
1,"Ceil’s voice fell silent as she saw Jethro enter from the far end of the square with a few hundred soldiers, and she found herself unable to breathe."
0,Hain-henel walked on his left.
0,"The rugs, cushions, and all the feast preparations were cleared quickly by many hands."
0,"The remaining Tolmyur soldiers filled the road, extending far back to the edge of the city."
0,"“Tolmyur has arrived on their own errand to meet with Ceil, widow of Emperor Yuro."
0,"Their Commanding General has not received word nor agreement from Ceil’s party for her surrender, so each side is presented as equals in discussion,” Hain-henel announced."
0,Ceil turned to Zose who was just as confused as she.
0,"This could not be a lie, because if Zose’s message had indeed been received by Jethro, then surely he would have used it to claim Ceil with the blessing of the Afarit."
0,Both Zose and Basara immediately understood.
0,Inym was not sent by Jit.
0,She learned of Ceil’s identity by intercepting the spik Zose released but kept this secret from them.
0,No doubt it was she who informed Ni’inca Ab’pul and placed them all in peril.
0,"A flicker of anger lit inside Basara, and those near her felt the heat."
0,"“If I ever meet Inym again, I will burn her to ash,” Basara said in a subdued voice."
0,At least Hain-henel had taken Ceil’s plight into consideration and guaranteed the equality of the two parties.
0,He must have confirmed Jethro’s motives first without revealing Zose’s assumption about those motives.
0,"For that, Ceil considered herself fortunate, but how long would that fortune last?"
0,"Seeing that Ceil would not immediately be surrendered to Tolmyur, Byurk walked forward and stood alone in the center of the square to welcome Jethro."
0,His men followed after him but continued onward to stand with their fellow soldiers on the far side of the square.
1,Jethro looked past Byurk to Ceil’s group and the circumference of Lycon guarding her.
0,“I have personal matters to address first.
0,"It will not take long,” Jethro said to Hain-henel beside him."
0,“You may oversee the discussions between Tolmyur and the Amel house after it is completed.”
0,"Hain-henel raised his hand, and the Afarit who had guided Jethro and his soldiers into the city moved to surround the square."
0,Neither Jethro’s soldiers nor Ceil’s party could leave.
0,"Jethro’s hand reached into empty space before him, vanishing at the wrist, and removed a thin whistle."
0,"He blew the sharp note, and Ceil immediately knew from where he received that instrument."
0,The ambassador of the lycon walked forward past Byurk and met Jethro first.
0,"Byurk turned back to Ceil’s party, to Basara, for an explanation."
0,He did not know that Jethro was in possession of a lycon whistle.
0,"“We will try to appeal to him first,” Basara told Ceil before she quickly trotted to Byurk."
0,"She crouched beside him, whispering something into Byurk’s ear that Ceil could not hear."
0,The lycon ambassador embraced Jethro and confirmed the scent.
0,"Ceil hoped that the whistle was ill-gotten and the lycon would become Jethro’s enemies, but from the reaction of the ambassador, that was not the case."
0,"“Friend of lycon, what is it that you ask of us,” the ambassador asked."
0,"“In honor of our favor, I request you not interfere with my dealings here."
0,"I will return the whistle once my business is done,” Jethro replied."
0,His voice was not an announcement to all but a personal conversation that was barely loud enough to reach Ceil’s ears.
0,"“Though your scent has weakened with time, we would honor your favor if not for Lady Ceil being welcomed as family of lycon,” the ambassador replied."
0,Jethro’s face twisted in consternation.
0,"He peered past the ambassador to Ceil, sending a cold shiver down Ceil’s back."
0,"There was an immense difference between the favor as a friend of the lycon and as family, and he could not imagine what fortune had enabled her to gain such favor."
0,"“I too am family of the lycon,” Jethro explained to the ambassador."
0,"“One of yours has chosen me as her mate, and although she has passed, I refuse to fine another due to my loyalty to her alone.”"
0,"“I do not know your story, only your scent and the whistle you carry."
0,"If what you say is true, then you too would be family."
0,"However, Lady Ceil is the savior of all lycon, and we cannot abandon her."
0,"Should you wish to do her harm, you will become the enemy of all lycon."
0,Keep your whistle.
0,"If there is another favor you would ask of us, we will accept, friend of lycon.”"
0,Jethro’s eyes met Ceil’s again after the lycon ambassador turned his back to Jethro.
0,"Ceil could not be sure from her distance, but she thought she saw the outward animosity in his gaze increase substantially."
0,"“Is your personal business finished,” Hain-henel asked Jethro."
1,"“It is,” Jethro replied, walking forward to finally meet Byurk and Basara in the center of the square."
0,Hain-henel stood between the two parties off to the side.
0,Veins of fire lit in his left leg which he stomped into the ground.
0,A ring of embers surrounded their group as a sign that what they would discuss should not be interrupted by those outside the circle.
0,He then stood silent and still to oversee.
0,"“It has been long since we last met,” Basara said to initiate the discussions."
0,“I am glad to see you well.”
0,Jethro ignored Basara’s greeting and glared at her.
0,“You of all people should understand.
0,Was it your plan to set the lycon as a barrier against me?
0,Did Elina mean nothing to you?”
0,"Fire lit in Basara’s eyes, but Byurk interceded before Jethro’s misdirected accusation ruined negotiations."
0,“Do not blame her.
0,You know just how fond of your late wife Basara had always been.
0,Our involvement with the lycon came as a direct result of my pursuit of Ceil and the bounty we placed on her head.”
0,"“And you are not against using their favor to hinder me, knowing what you do?” Jethro asked, his calm voice bearing an incredible weight."
0,"“If we must,” Byurk answered."
0,"“And how is it then that my most trusted friend has become my enemy?” Jethro asked Byurk before glaring once more at Basara, directing his blame."
0,Byurk’s expression softened.
0,"“My actions may make me a traitor to Tolmyur, but I have always been loyal to you, even now."
0,"I only guard Lady Ceil against you because of what I have learned of her fate and future, a future you and her both share."
0,I will continue to guard her so long as you seek her death.
0,Basara and I agree to surrender her to you so long as you promise to spare her life.”
0,"“Enough!” Jethro said, and at that same moment, Byurk vanished with a pop, reappearing unharmed in a flash of light next to his soldiers at the entrance to the square."
0,Byurk was swiftly bound with prepared cords.
0,Hain-henel stood in front of Jethro.
0,"“I will not permit hostilities between parties,” he warned."
0,"“I apologize, but this is another personal matter."
0,It is my duty to discipline my officers.
0,My dealings are not with traitors and betrayers.
0,I am here to speak with the widow of Emperor Yuro as agreed.”
0,"“General Byurk has formerly stated his conviction on behalf of Ceil by agreeing to receive proper punishment for the betrayal of his country, so I will permit it,” Hain-henel announced."
1,He then turned to Ceil’s party.
0,“The commander of all Tolmyur’s armies requests audience with Ceil of the House of Amel.”
0,Ceil’s hands gripped into fists in a meager attempt to hold in her fear-drenched anxiety.
0,Her feet felt shackled to the stone alter platform below her.
0,"She could not find the strength to take a step, but neither could she remain silent."
0,"She had learned in the fairy council in the Gallanvale and in the meeting of commanders at Revlan that by remaining silent, others would speak for her and direct her future."
0,Sammy was right.
0,She needed to stop waiting to be saved.
0,"She determined her future, no one else."
0,Ceil took a deep breath.
0,"“Lord Hain-henel, as you saw when Jethro detained Byurk, I would only endanger myself by joining you before Jethro."
0,"No matter what power you may hold to oversee our discussion, Jethro’s magic is more powerful still."
0,"He laid ruin to all of Vallen to find me, throwing away countless of his own soldiers’ lives."
0,I do not doubt that he would willingly kill me knowing well that the Afarit would see to the destruction of his army.
0,Jethro alone could escape unharmed with his spatial magic.”
0,Those near Ceil admired her boldness and foresight to the dangers of approaching Jethro.
0,They felt the weight of the long pause after her accusation against Jethro bear down on those who heard it.
0,"However, the truth of the pause was far different."
0,Ceil’s body shivered.
0,"Her breath ran out, and she struggled to refill her lungs."
0,"While her words were true, she only feared approaching her enemy who would see the world to ruin if only he had a chance to kill her."
0,Jethro wanted to end the line of Amel at any cost.
0,“And…” Ceil continued with much less force to her voice.
0,"“And I hold no attachment to the Amel name, to an emperor who would see me live in sorrow.”"
0,"Ceil gritted her teeth, both in fear and anger."
0,“I am not Ceil Amel!
0,"I am Ceil FeSeras, sole daughter of Arlen of Seras and Lum of the line of Dharin of Kellendale, Thorn General of Vallen."
0,"I am a daughter of Heivleil, an innocent town you razed for the sole crime of being the home of my childhood!"
0,"I was sold by my father to Emperor Yuro to be his possession, not a member of the Amelian line."
0,"Yuro would never allow me, a descendent of fairies, to bear him impure offspring."
0,"If you seek audience with a royal line, you should address the line of Vallen to answer for your unjust genocide of the fairies."
0,"Kiri of the line of Dharin, successor to the throne of Vallen, can then speak with you.”"
0,"Ceil took a deep breath, filling her lungs with all the pain she bore and the light of hope that Sammy left her."
0,"“As for me, I will not barter my life with a madman!”"
0,"“Jethro, she is also a victim of the royal family,” Basara said, hoping to dissuade Jethro from rash action."
0,Jethro ignored her.
0,"A wide, dimpled smile spread on his face as he walked forward."
0,"“Jethro, should you leave the circle, your right to negotiation will end,” Hain-henel warned."
0,Jethro stopped at the edge of the embers.
0,“Did you not hear her?
0,She clearly does not want to speak with me.” He then stepped outside the circle.
0,"“The Lord of Contracts, Hain-henel, has born witness here that Ceil has renounced her attachment to the Amel line."
0,The role of Tolmyur in pursuit of her life is over.
0,This is Tolmyur’s victory.
0,"At last, we have obtained our revenge for the Coastal War and the crimes of Amel against us."
0,No one remains on Whinhlem who can continue the Amel name!”
0,Jethro raised his hands in a halfhearted shrug.
0,All at once his army cheered with shouts and pounding armor.
0,"Without fanfare or ceremony, the war ended."
0,Basara watched Jethro saunter forward over the dusty square towards Ceil’s party.
0,Suspicion wormed its way into her thoughts.
0,Were negotiations truly over?
0,Was the answer as simple as Ceil denouncing the Amelian royal line?
0,Jethro looked over his shoulder at both Basara and Hain-henel and smiled.
0,“All that remains is my personal feud with Eydis FeAmel.
0,My actions from here on are my own without connection to Tolmyur.”
0,No…
0,"Basara raced to catch Jethro, but he vanished."
0,"In the near-imperceptible moment of time that Jethro appeared in a flash of light in front of Ceil, Justin was already moving Ceil behind him to shield her."
0,Jethro felt the distinct sensation of time magic.
0,He eyed the young man who was now far more mature than the terrified boy he remembered back on Earth.
0,"Justin’s eyes pierced Jethro with anger, not fear, and Jethro could not help but be impressed."
0,"Jethro had considered killing him to deal a grave emotional blow to Eydis, possibly sending his head to the capital building of that nation where it was sure to be noticed, but the skill of a time mage who disregarded the very laws of the art was too rare a treasure to spoil."
0,"Before Justin finished positioning Ceil behind him, before anyone else in Ceil’s party had the time to react, Justin vanished with a snap."
0,"Jethro sent him where he had initially planned before the sprite’s interference, to Tolmyur and more specifically, Jethro’s home."
0,"Life in Tolmyur was harsh, but Jethro did not worry."
0,His house servants and Fect would be there to greet him.
0,"If Jethro wanted a head to send to Eydis, there was another candidate now unguarded in front of him, the widow of Emperor Yuro."
0,"The Vallen party and lycon moved immediately to attack Jethro and secure Ceil’s safety, but Jethro grew a barrier around him and Ceil, forcing it outward to push everyone else off and away from the circular altar platform."
0,"At that distance it held, preventing anyone from interfering."
0,The two large afarit who guarded the altar landed on their feet and backed away from the altar platform toward the deep ravine unperturbed and unangered.
0,"The afarit at the borders of the square rushed to subdue the Tolmyur army, but none of the soldiers moved."
0,"They remained still, showing that this was, indeed, a personal matter unrelated to them."
0,The afarit cordoned them off to prevent interference should that stance change in the future.
0,"Ceil jumped back and brandished her staff, knowing well that it would be useless against a mage of Jethro’s quality."
0,Even Justin’s time magic that was strong enough to freeze and ancient Lurr was useless against him.
0,Ceil worried what had become of Justin.
0,“I apologize.
0,"I truly have nothing against you,” Jethro said with a fake sigh."
0,"“Eydis FeAmel, however, was apparently quite fond of you."
0,Thought of you as family.
0,"For that reason alone, you must die.”"
0,Ceil felt cold despite the heat.
0,"She grew pale as if a titan had his foot raised above her, ready to crush her into the stone."
0,"She wanted to ask what crime Eydis had committed against Jethro to drive him to such madness, but she knew that time had passed the moment she refused discourse."
0,"Ceil felt the darkness return and a painful, bony grip on her shoulder."
0,She lacked the composure to reject it.
0,A suffocating beckon met her ears and seeped into her thoughts.
0,"If I am to die to Jethro now, why can I not kill him?"
0,"If we both are vital to the future, and one of us will die now anyway, why should it be me?"
0,Did I not find a chance of support after so long?
0,Did I not smile not long ago?
0,Why should I give all that up now?
0,"The hamadryad staff in Ceil’s hand blackened, and the air around her grew stale."
0,Zose launched himself from the stone platform behind Jethro with his bone sword aimed at Jethro’s lower spine.
0,"He knew he should not kill Jethro, but if he could injure him enough to end the attack, Tyree could heal any damage done."
0,The bone sword hit its mark but failed to penetrate.
0,It snapped at the tip and heel.
0,Zose’s incredible momentum he thought would knock Jethro over did nothing against the firm barrier Jethro always had around himself.
0,Zose collided into the barrier with the full force of his momentum.
0,"His head hid, and the resulting impact knocked him unconscious."
0,"Zose’s limp body bounced back and crumpled to the stone, his right arm and shoulder completely disfigured."
0,"“Zose!” Basara charged the barrier, each step leaving smoldering stone in her furious wake."
0,Chloe quickly followed with her arms aflame.
0,Those futilely assaulting the seemingly impenetrable barrier gave a wide birth.
0,"Only Hethyro had courage enough to keep up the assault, not fearing Basara’s flame."
0,"Chloe readied to clap to release a powerful, directed explosion, but Basara syphoned Chloe’s fire, forming it into a massive ribbon that fell like an enflamed guillotine on the barrier."
0,Jethro’s entire body locked up from the recoil.
0,He glanced behind him to see what pathetic attack hit his back and who was assaulting the outer barrier.
0,"He expected to see Basara, but not even she had that much power, at least not in his memory."
0,Ceil swung at Jethro with her staff in his moment of distraction.
0,"Jethro expected the defensive barrier he placed around himself to repel the measly attack, but when the staff struck, the barrier at the location of impact crumbled."
0,The destruction spread rapidly from the location of impact until his barrier vanished like the shattering of tempered glass.
0,"There was no recoil, no force."
0,The ven used to construct the barrier simply died.
0,"Jethro vanished and reappeared on the other side of the strange alter, still within the outer barrier."
0,He quickly breathed off his surprise and shook the feeling back into his arms.
0,"“I was not expecting that,” he said with an exasperated smile."
0,The young elf was not as helpless as he had assumed.
0,"Behind her, a male oread lay motionless on the stone."
0,"The Earth woman, whose enflamed visage strangely did not pale in comparison to Basara’s, fought alongside Basara to break the barrier."
0,"He did not doubt they could, given enough time."
0,"Ceil, emboldened by his retreat, charged."
0,"“I guess I should take this elsewhere,” Jethro sighed."
0,"He readied a quick transmission formula and cast it on Ceil once she was close enough, but she did not disappear."
0,Ceil screamed out and collapsed into the altar in her charge.
0,Her body burned as if it was being eaten away by poison.
0,"She tried to lift herself to defend against her enemy standing on the other side of the altar, but the light exertion caused her to vomit blood."
0,Life magic told her that her insides were torn in an impossible manner.
0,"She did not know what kind of magic Jethro cast on her, but she knew that she could not recover in time to defend herself."
0,"Her attacker walked leisurely around the alter to stand in front of her with a quizzical stare, but he nearly collapsed as the recoil of Chloe and Basara’s assault seized his body."
0,"“Could you hold off for one moment,” Jethro moaned."
0,He was sweating heavily from the heat of the barrage that was too hot for his barrier to completely suppress.
0,He turned back to Ceil and shook his head lightly.
0,"“You are full of surprises, aren’t you."
0,Enough of this.
0,Sending Eydis whatever remains should suffice.
0,She should be skilled enough in life magic to learn it’s you.”
0,Ceil managed to pull herself to her trembling legs using her staff as a crutch in her right hand.
0,"If she was to die, she wanted to die standing and facing her enemy."
0,She recognized the form Jethro took.
0,It was burned into her memory.
0,She would suffer the same fate as that young Gallanvale girl.
0,"Ceil scowled at Jethro through seeping, bloody lips as he extended his hand."
0,"Spatial magic left Jethro’s hand in an explosive wave, rejecting everything in front of him."
0,The force of the attack blew Ceil into the alter behind her.
0,"Her back slammed against the top, and she nearly flipped over it."
0,"Her head barely missed hitting the ancient, impervious stone."
0,"There she lay, sprawled on her back widthwise across the altar."
0,She could not feel her legs or her left arm.
0,She had shielded her face with the staff in her right hand and her left arm in front of it.
0,"She tried moving her left arm, but nothing happened."
0,She quickly realized as her body entered shock that her arm was not there.
0,"The fabric of the jack had shredded, revealing the plates of resfahil."
0,"Below, her left leg and part of her hip was missing."
0,"The hamadryad staff infused with death magic had protected her right leg, her right arm, and her head."
0,The resfahil-plated jack had protected her torso.
0,"Those who had given her their support, the hamadryad and the craftsmen of Revlan, had protected her, but not well enough."
0,Ceil lost the strength to lift her head.
0,She did not notice Jethro’s barrier finally breaking or the erupting sounds of battle.
0,"Ceil was conscious enough to know that she was bleeding out and barely coherent enough to use life magic to stem what bleeding she could, but the damage was too severe."
0,She knew well enough that she would not survive.
0,"Even if Tyree was there trying to treat her, Ceil doubted it would help."
0,The horrid apparition of the Aspect of Death floated above her.
0,His faceless expression under his void-like eyes seemed almost to smile.
0,"He reached forward as if beckoning to her, like he had before Sammy pulled her back to the light."
0,But there was no going back this time.
0,"Already, Ceil felt herself fading."
0,"The Aspect of Death reached, but instead of touching Ceil, he placed his putrid, skeletal hand on the altar."
0,"Ceil felt herself get sucked inward, and she vanished."
0,Chapter 23
0,“Bydrofe’s Favor”
0,Ceil
1,The encroaching blackness creeping from the edges of Ceil’s vision vanished.
0,"She could see a river of stars far above in the cloudless night, undimmed by the smaller of the two moons in half-wane."
0,She felt the breeze and heard the rustling of lush plants.
0,"Despite the dark of night far above, inside the mountain crown of the Afarit was bright as noonday as if it had its own sun."
0,"A verdant paradise saturated with ven surrounded her, and for a moment Ceil thought she had returned to Fiorrae."
0,"This land was unnatural, an idyllic garden in the center of the fire wastes."
0,"Fiorrae was a land saturated with ven--every rock, river, and plant was enriched with it--but even the home of the sprites could not compare."
0,Life ven hung so thick in the air that Ceil felt revitalized.
0,"Solely by existing in this place, she had been pulled momentarily from the grasp of death."
0,"However, the vitality Ceil gained removed the state of shock her body entered to protect her from being overwhelmed by her injuries."
0,"The moment she realized where she was, the garden of Bydrofe, Guardian of Whinhlem, she writhed and screamed, unable to bear the pain."
0,Something in the garden stirred.
0,"Ceil’s cries summoned the attention of a massive body that rose as he stood, so tall that the curls of his long, black hair nearly reached the rim of the massive, mountainous crown."
0,"He emanated an authoritative power from his presence, not unlike the Sprite Arkhon."
0,"Each step of his refined, godly body that no artist could ever fashion into metal or stone landed in silence without even a tremor."
0,"The plants at his feet moved for him, and the ground cradled his feet."
0,"Bydrofe looked down at the small, writhing girl with pity and sadness."
0,“Hain-henel sent you to me in such a state?
0,"Child, no harm or injury is worth a meeting,” he spoke in a deep, fatherly voice like being wrapped in a soft blanket."
0,“To give an arm and a leg… The Afarit should stop accepting such tribute.”
0,The immense pain Ceil felt slowly ebbed as shock returned to her body.
0,The surge of vitality from the abundant life ven could only help her so much as close to death as she was.
0,Ceil’s screams grew to sobs.
0,"She watched the enormous figure she had hoped to meet struggle to sit back down in front of her, although the proximity was an illusion caused by his size; he was still afar off."
0,Only then did she realize that Bydrofe was injured himself.
0,This land that was so full of life was his medicine.
0,It was a place of healing.
0,Someone of immense power had injured Whinhlem’s guardian.
0,"“Please,” Ceil cried, begging for mercy and hope in her waning minutes."
0,“Are you the emissary of Amel?
0,Hain-henel informed me of your arrival and that you lacked tribute.”
0,Bydrofe looked south to the inner wall of the earthen crown.
0,“Hain-henel says you have renounced the Amel House that I have spent these many years cultivating.
0,"Though, you are not a direct descendent."
0,"The blood of Amel runs through you as it does through most High Elves who obey my counsel, but it is impure.”"
0,"Bydrofe looked to the east, upwards towards the sky."
0,His calm demeanor vanished.
0,"“Tolmyur has ended the line of Amel.” A deep, calm anger saturated his voice, like distant rolling thunder, and the forest shook."
0,"Once again, Bydrofe faced south."
0,“Tolmyur’s commander seeks your life.
0,I chose the elves to succeed humanity when the humans failed and turned against their creators.
0,The humans have gone too far again.
0,I showed them mercy by not eliminating their kind when they transgressed the greatest taboo.”
0,Ceil recalled the story told her on her travels to the Afarit and what she learned from Ni’inca Ab’pul.
0,"It connected with the truth of the history between elves and humans that Basara had told her, her indoctrination in the Amelian Palace, the elven hatred for humanity, and everything else she had seen and learned."
0,The ancient human civilization had pulled a god from divinity and in return was destroyed.
0,"Bydrofe was that god, and in the battle, he was injured."
0,"He became the guardian of Whinhlem in his weakened state and lost divinity, a powerful entity honored by all except the human races."
0,"Of all the races on the continent, the descendants of humans alone did not have a contract with the Afarit for visitation."
0,"When the first Amel made pilgrimage to the Afarit, Bydrofe chose the elves to succeed the ancient human race."
0,"Bydrofe indoctrinated them with a hatred for humanity and a desire for purity of their bloodline, and so Amel gathered all those who were not descended from the ancient humans to drive out and suppress them."
0,"The elves were Bydrofe’s tool, and after ages passed and the descendants of humanity had no relation to the sins of their forbearers, Tolmyur yet remained the eternal victim of elven cruelty."
0,"“As for you, your blood is impure,” Bydrofe continued."
0,“I must find another to succeed Amel.
0,"However, out of respect for your courage and conviction, I will have the Afarit purge the city of every descendent of the race of humans."
0,"If Gaea agrees, perhaps we should finally purge them all.”"
0,“No!” Ceil cried with all her waning strength.
0,"The exertion left her weak, and the darkness began creeping in."
0,Ceil could not die yet.
0,She had to tell him.
0,"If these were her last words, she had to use them to save the life of her friends, true friends that had pulled her from the darkness of her suffering."
0,"“Not Chloe, not…”"
0,"Ceil tried to say Justin’s name, even Basara and Zose who were descendants of the ancient humans, but her weak breath ran out."
0,"She did not know where Justin was, where Jethro sent him, but if he was still somewhere within the city, she wanted him safe as well."
0,"Ceil remembered the Sprite Arkhon’s test, the lesson he wanted her to learn as she traveled with Sammy, Chloe, and Justin through Fiorrae and Melia."
0,Humans were not her enemy.
0,Not all humans were evil.
0,Even if Bydrofe had a deeply rooted hatred for the humans of Whinhlem…
0,“Chloe…and Justin… not from… Whinhlem.” Ceil managed to finish with the last her body would give.
0,All the air within the earthen crown’s paradise grew still as if time froze.
0,Not a leaf rustled or blade of grass bent.
0,Bydrofe glared down at Ceil with power and authority.
0,"Ceil now saw Bydrofe not as a powerful being that guarded and protected Whinhlem, but as one of Whinhlem’s gods."
0,"His fury was not from a personal grudge against humanity but from the breaking of divine law, the same that brought his judgement against the ancient humans."
0,“I must purge this infestation before it spreads.”
0,"Bydrofe vanished from the still air, and with his disappearance, the tranquil breeze returned."
0,"A sudden tremor came from the south, and Ceil knew he had appeared on the other side of the crown to kill her friends."
1,She had made a terrible mistake.
0,She had only desired to save her friends but instead had doomed them.
0,Her life truly was a farce.
0,"She was a plague that killed everyone near her, everyone she loved."
0,"Ceil tried to cry out, but her lungs would no longer receive air."
0,She felt cold.
0,"The contest between death and the enriched life of the garden was over, and death had won."
0,The shadow of death spread from Ceil to the surrounding foliage.
0,All the plants grew brittle and slowly crumbled into powder.
0,The healing ven in the air twisted and became a poisonous miasma that killed all the ven it touched.
0,"Please, save them, Ceil prayed to anyone or anything who would listen."
0,All light left Ceil and her world grew dark.
0,The putrid skeletal form stood above her in the nothingness with his arms extended.
0,"She heard not a voice but felt a message within her soul, a part of her that was not her."
0,“Is that your final wish?”
0,Ceil could not answer.
0,"Before another thought could trace a path across her worn and tired mind, her body grew still, and rest at last claimed her."
0,"“As frail as this woman is, her will was too strong,” a voice spoke through Ceil’s cold, lifeless lips."
0,“Resisting until the end.”
0,Ceil’s body sat up and inspected its surroundings and itself.
0,It eyed its missing arm and leg with annoyance.
0,The miasma spread out and consumed all life in the immediate vicinity.
0,"When the miasma returned, the body quickly mended, first from bone and then flesh, but its skin remained a pale, deathly pallor."
0,It moved the fingers of its regrown hand and found the newly regrown tails extending out from under it.
0,"“Peculiar things,” the voice said, never having had a tail, let alone two, in its past life."
0,"It did not care much for the body, but now that it was in control, it could claim another should the opportunity present itself."
0,Ceil’s body stood and tested the new leg.
0,"It held firm, stronger than it had ever been in life, but legs could not reach the friends that Ceil held so dear."
0,"Although the revived Aspect of Death held no love for them, he could honor Ceil’s dying wish and save them by confronting his eternal enemies, the gods, of which Bydrofe was one he had failed to kill when he ruled all of humanity on Whinhlem as their God King."
0,The Aspect of Death drew upon Ceil’s dormant royal fairy bloodline to manifest black-feathered wings that radiated decay from the death ven they were composed of.
0,"With a single grand flap that spread miasma in its wake, the Aspect of Death shot into the air."
0,Chapter 24
0,“Divine Judgement”
1,"Members of Ceil’s party watched in fear, anger, and panic as Jethro’s attack blew Ceil back into the altar."
0,"For a moment, time felt frozen as many thought her instantly dead, but the slightest movement of Ceil’s body spurred them to action."
0,"Against all odds, she survived, but if they did not reach her quickly, she would surely die."
0,"Hethyro, who had kept some distance and had assaulted the barrier with fire magic now dove into the heat of Basara and Chloe’s attacks, heat he knew was beyond what his fire affinity was capable of resisting."
0,"He pummeled the barrier using enflamed strikes with all the might his massive, Mountain Elf frame could summon."
0,"Thanysa, who stood at the barriers left perimeter, readied a practiced stance and placed her palm against the barrier."
0,"She was never as strong nor as skilled as her mother, Symra, and her arms were still blackened and weak, but her ven channels and wellpoints remained true."
0,She waited for the precise moment of Basara and Chloe’s next cleaving attack.
0,"Basara and Chloe’s ribbon of flame, now more akin to a massive blade, cleaved into Jethro’s barrier like an executioner’s axe."
0,"The moment it struck, Thanysa released the disrupting pulse of her stance."
0,Sparks showered the party as the barrier repelled the attack and spread as far as the afarit who stood guard along the edges of the square.
0,Kiri barely managed to fly out of the way of the strike.
0,"When all thought the barrier had successfully resisted the assault, Hethyro’s clenched fists shattered what sliver of life the barrier had left."
0,Basara ignored Jethro and Ceil and fell to her knees beside Zose the moment the barrier fell.
0,Her love and concern for him quenched her maenad rampage before it could peak.
0,She almost grabbed him but stopped at the last moment.
0,"In her emotional distress, she was too hot to touch him."
0,"Chloe charged Jethro alone in Basara’s place, but the far swifter Lycon would reach him first."
0,"An arrow released by Benab bounced off Jethro’s shoulder, informing the nearest lycon that Jethro was still protected."
0,"The lycon continued unabated, ready to tear apart this horrid man who had gravely injured and possibly killed both the saviors of the lycon."
0,Jethro recovered from the recoil fast enough to raise his hand in a motion to strike down his attackers.
0,"Chloe recognized the attack, the same he had once used to try and kill her back in Gullivan and would have succeeded if not for Justin’s time magic."
0,"She heard tales of the attack, that Jethro could sever anything with it."
0,"Chloe was behind the lycon, but that attack would slice through them and her without effort."
0,She had no way to dodge and quickly prepared her heart for the end.
0,"But, the attack never came."
0,Jethro hesitated to strike down the lycon.
0,"Kiri dove down to Ceil to secret her away to the two dryads while Jethro was distracted, but once she saw the extent of the damage Jethro had dealt, she knew that Ceil should not be touched for fear of the shock killing her."
0,Her young cousin who had to bear the weight of the future in the face of an unknown calamity that would soon envelope them all was beyond her ability to help.
0,"“Tyree!” Kiri called to the Melian who was awaiting a safe opportunity to rush to the altar, but before Tyree and Tae could near the altar, light flashed behind Kiri."
0,Tae collided with a barrier Jethro reformed around him and the altar to keep the lycon and other assailants back.
0,"Kiri looked up at her enemy, questioning how this evil man could ever help them through the calamity."
0,She had no means to protect herself or Ceil.
0,She had no magical affinity aside from the flight enabled by her bloodline.
0,"“The last successor to the rebellious Vallen line,” Jethro said, oddly calm despite the opposition against him."
0,"“One day you will look back on your actions here and curse your ignorance, but by then, it will already be too late,” Kiri warned right before Jethro split her in half with a simple swish of his index and middle fingers."
1,"The moment Kiri’s body fell to a bloody heap on the altar platform, Ceil vanished."
0,Jethro’s eyes grew wide.
0,"In Ceil’s place was a portal he had never seen before, and had he not recognized the distinct feel of teleportation magic, he never would have suspected it to be a portal."
0,Those outside his outer barrier were likewise surprised and stopped their assault.
0,Spatial ven rose like threads through a funnel from the top of the platform until they met at a wisp-like sphere of faint rainbow light.
0,No one had cast the magic; it originated from some enchantment on the altar and altar platform.
0,"There was no perimeter to the portal, no tear or rift cut in space."
0,The destination was not visible.
0,"Much like Jethro’s transmission formula, it acted solely as the catalyst to move a body from the origin to some destination."
0,"If Jethro understood the sudden disappearance of the widow’s body correctly, contact with the portal was sufficient to facilitate teleportation."
0,Jethro tried to touch the bizarre portal--those outside his barrier renewed their assault futilely trying to prevent his chase--but the portal repelled him like a barrier had been placed over it.
0,"His brief read of the spatial ven revealed a formula far beyond his comprehension, a complexity not unlike the spatial magic used to block his teleportation on Earth."
0,"He did, however, glean one piece of understanding that made him so excited that he momentarily forgot that his target had escaped through the portal."
0,The secret to the stability of the portal was the external barrier.
0,The stability function within a teleportation formula was in essence a barrier applied within to maintain the structure of the portal long enough for the one using it to arrive safely at the destination.
0,That was why regular transmission did not need a stability function; it was near-simultaneous.
0,"That was not so with this portal that continued to hold itself open with perfect stability, unlike any other portal Jethro knew."
0,They were all unstable and prone to collapse.
0,This external barrier was managing the same stability function at a far more advanced level from the outside.
0,Jethro placed his hand on the external barrier once again and registered the formula to memory the best he could with his infinitesimal understanding of its structure.
0,"He could spend days picking it apart, and that thought excited him to no end."
0,The only question remaining was why the portal had appeared and where it sent Yuro’s widow.
1,"“Cease all hostilities,” Hain-henel called."
0,"Following the order with reluctance, those attacking Jethro’s barrier eventually stopped as the order was translated to the lycon who could not understand it."
0,The two dryads took the opportunity provided by the ceasefire to circle around to Zose and Basara.
0,"The rancor in the glares Jethro received, however, did not cease."
0,Jethro almost sighed in relief.
0,He was sure he would feel the ghost buzzing of the numbing recoil for the next couple days from all the attacks against his barriers.
0,"Jethro expected to be reprimanded or otherwise threatened for his actions as Hain-henel approached the altar platform, but he did not care."
0,There was nothing Hain-henel could do to him other than forever prevent Tolmyur from having visiting rights to the Afarit.
0,He walked around to the other side of the altar and faced the Earth woman whose body was so hot that her maenad gown wafted faint smoke.
0,"Shown by the power of her flame that Basara had utilized to assault his barrier, Jethro understood that she alone was a threat to him."
0,Hain-henel stopped before the group that stood both on and off the circular platform.
0,“Lady Ceil’s conviction and sacrifice has been accepted.
0,"Bydrofe, Guardian of Whinhlem, has summoned her,” he announced."
0,No cheers erupted from members of the widow’s party.
0,They all saw the extent of the damage Jethro had done to her.
0,"Even though she was summoned by Bydrofe, she would soon die."
0,"“Your role in this is finished, commander of Tolmyur’s armies,” Hain-henel told Jethro."
0,"“By providing for Lady Ceil the means to show her conviction, we will forgive your transgressions here.”"
0,“Do you have any idea what he has done?” Thanysa shouted at Hain-henel.
0,"“The sprites have foretold that Ceil has a role in the future, and that her death would cause dire, unforeseen consequences.”"
0,Jethro ruffled his hair.
0,“Can I at least have her body once this is all over?”
0,“No!” the Earth woman screamed.
0,She lashed out and struck Jethro’s barrier with an enflamed punch.
0,The flame that burst from the rebound nearly engulfed those around her who already stood somewhat distant to avoid her radiating heat.
0,"Jethro’s hand’s locked up, so he quickly shook them out."
1,"“I said cease…” Hain-henel began, but his eyes were quickly drawn towards the monolithic, earthen crown."
0,His demeaner suddenly changed.
0,Veins of fire lined his arms and legs and the coarse rings along the surface of his flat horns glowed a deep red.
0,His eyes sharpened to a glare.
0,“Who among you is named Chloe and Justin?”
0,Those on the altar glanced at each other but did not answer.
0,"Benab, sensing the heightened hostility, rushed onto the altar platform and stood with Chloe at his back."
0,An arrow was nocked in his bowstring but the string was not drawn.
0,"Thanysa cursed Benab under her breath, but now it was too late."
0,“Trespassers!
0,Violators of divine law!
0,"All those who hear my voice, eliminate the party of Ceil!” Hain-henel called."
0,All the Afarit who had watched the brief discussions and Jethro’s momentary assault from the perimeter of the square charged the altar.
0,Each of them glowed with veins of fire coursing through their skin.
0,"Jethro’s army joined in the charge from the far end of the square, taking Hain-henel’s call as permission to aid Jethro in eliminating Ceil’s party."
0,"The lycon in their immutable honor were the first to run out and defend the altar platform, but without magic, they were swiftly eliminated."
0,They were emissaries at the banquet and unarmed.
0,"This troubled Jethro, but he remained within the safety of his barrier to watch the spectacle as he leaned on the bizarre portal’s barrier behind him."
0,"Basara left Zose to Tyree and seized control of any approaching fire thrown by the afarit, weaving it into a fine ribbon and sending it back at the charging horde."
0,"The afarit, however, were mostly unharmed by the condensed flame."
0,"Benab fired arrow after arrow at Hain-henel, but each arrow was batted away into cinders by Hain-henel’s glowing hand."
0,"Hethyro used Benab’s distraction to charge and tackle Hain-henel but quickly realized that despite his larger stature, the afarit’s ignition enabled Hain-henel to quickly overpower him."
0,Hain-henel threw Hethyro across his shoulders and snapped his neck in a single fluid motion.
0,He then dumped the troll off his back.
0,“Be careful.
0,"Bydrofe seeks your life,” Keeya spoke into Jethro’s mind."
0,"“You should flee, now.”"
1,"The moment that the horde of Afarit nearly reached the altar platform, a thunderous earthquake shook the square, toppling everyone to the ground."
0,A massive figure as tall as the mountain crown stood towering from the ancient city.
0,His feet had crushed into the many tiers of ruins below him.
0,His gaze filled with divine authority bore down on the square.
0,All but Chloe and Jethro felt its weight and could not rise from the ground.
0,Jethro felt an immense wave of spatial magic when Bydrofe appeared.
0,The sensation was complex and not dissimilar from the altar.
0,"By appearance, the teleportation magic Bydrofe used was not unlike Jethro’s transmission."
0,"Jethro recalled his transmission experiments with Emer back in Tolmyur and the massive, heated explosion caused by a tree that would be dwarfed by this towering figure."
0,There was not so much as a ripple in the wind when Bydrofe appeared.
0,Jethro understood immediately that this titan’s spatial magic was far superior.
0,He now thought he understood why Keeya warned him what might happen if Bydrofe personally acted against him.
0,There was nowhere on Whinhlem Jethro could flee.
0,What Jethro did not know was that Keeya’s warning was far graver.
0,"“Two trespassers from other worlds,” Bydrofe spoke with the sound of thunder into the minds of all who saw him, transcending language."
0,"The ground shook with his voice, and several of the ruins along the edge of the fissure separating the city from the mountain crown crumbled down into the molten depths carrying whatever afarit that resided within to their deaths."
0,"“By divine decree of Gaea, all who have seen or heard word spoken by the trespassers must perish."
0,Their influence on Whinhlem must be expunged.”
0,"While the Tolmyur soldiers began to panic in their immobile state, the afarit pressed their faces to the ground, accepting Bydrofe’s judgement."
0,"“Where is Justin,” Chloe quickly asked Jethro."
0,"“He is safe in Tolmyur,” Jethro replied honestly in English."
0,"“Good,” she replied."
0,"“Keeya, what chance do I have against him?” Jethro asked, feeling the slight onset of fear, something that seemed almost foreign to him after so long."
0,"“On your own, none."
0,"With help, very little.”"
0,“Can you defeat him?”
0,"“Perhaps, but at great cost.”"
0,"“Then that is not an option,” Jethro replied before Keeya could reject his proposal, knowing full well she would."
0,Keeya would never place the few remaining Kissiae in danger to save him.
0,Jethro felt gratitude from Keeya welling in his thoughts.
0,"“There is little I can do, but I can still help."
0,I can send you my ven through our connection.
0,"It will be slow, but use it as you need.”"
0,"The moment Jethro felt the immensity of the foreign ven entering him, he immediately understood the process: a combination of life and spatial magic that perhaps only a Kissiae Hamadryad fused with a spatial magic master could ever achieve."
0,This was far more help than Jethro could have ask for.
1,"Chloe’s eyes flitted from Bydrofe to Jethro, unsure what to do."
0,"At first, she thought Jethro was speaking to her in a language she did not understand, but when the one-sided conversation seemingly continued on its own, she knew otherwise."
0,"He seemed ready to fight, meaning that this was an opponent not even Jethro could escape."
0,"Instead of fear, that thought brough Chloe some comfort."
0,"After hearing Bydrofe’s declaration, the first thought that entered her mind was that out of everyone here, she and Jethro had to survive for the sake of the future, if what the sprites prophesied was correct."
0,That realization tormented her.
0,She did not want to abandon any of her friends here.
0,She had already lost so many to war and conflict.
0,"She couldn’t forsake Benab, Thanysa, Basara, Tae, or anyone."
0,"If she was to die, she wanted to die protecting those she loved."
0,"She asked if Justin was safe, and thankfully, he was far away in Tolmyur."
0,"At least should Jethro and her fall, perhaps Justin alone could do something about the future on his own."
0,"“How strong are you,” Jethro asked in English."
0,“I need time to create a portal.”
0,Chloe’s heart sank.
0,"As much as the thought of abandoning the fight brought her anguish, she knew that Jethro had made the correct choice."
0,He was preparing for escape.
0,Chloe did not have the luxury to respond or question whether Jethro’s escape plan included her.
0,Bydrofe stomped his foot into the ruined city.
0,The massive tremor knocked both Chloe and Jethro prone.
0,A section of the top tier of the city no less than four or five hundred meters wide upheaved and fell their direction.
0,"Should it land, it would cover the entire square and all those who had associated with Jethro or Chloe."
0,Chloe righted herself and drew upon all the ven she had remaining.
0,"Thankfully, Basara’s masterful control over Chloe’s flames in the assault against Jethro’s barrier prevented unneeded waste."
0,She still had most of her ven.
0,Chloe’s arms ignited into a massive inferno that rose high into the air.
0,She forced the flame to condense at the tips of her middle fingers as she swung her arms into a clap.
0,She never saw the effect of her desperation.
0,Chloe blacked out instantly from the force of her own attack.
0,Jethro quickly repurposed his outer barrier to slow Chloe’s momentum as she was blown through and tumbled to his side.
0,"Had he left the barrier rigid and true, she likely would have died on impact."
0,Chloe’s hands and arms were burnt and blistering.
0,"The sleeves of her maenad gown that was clearly of Basara’s weave, a gown that should have been impervious to all fire, had burnt away."
0,He had never seen such self-destructive power.
0,Jethro returned to his feet and watched the explosion blow through the right end of the massive section of city.
0,"Roofs, walls, and columns from the many structures scattered like shrapnel far larger than any person."
0,The right end that broke off from the force of the explosion fell into the ravine to the north.
0,The force of the blast was such that the trajectory of the remaining slab of the city ruins tilted downward to the left.
0,"When it hit the ground and crushed the top layer of ruins, the long slab buckled and split down the middle."
0,"The stone crumbled, raining down on the left end of the long square."
0,"The split section crashed across the center of the square, the tremor of the impact dropping Jethro to his knees."
0,"He did not know how many of his soldiers had been crushed, but at least the majority were still at the far end of the square."
0,There should be plenty who were lucky enough to avoid the falling debris of ruins and stone.
0,Jethro then realized that none of the debris had fallen on the altar platform.
0,None of Chloe’s allies who remained unmoving under Bydrofe’s pressure had been injured.
0,"Was that intentional, or was it impossible luck?"
0,Was the ancient altar to blame?
0,Some unknown protective magic to safeguard the portal to Bydrofe?
0,Jethro glanced aside to the unconscious woman.
0,Or was it deliberate?
0,“I need more ven!” Jethro called to Keeya as he continued constructing his formula through the chaos.
0,"The dust was slowly settling, and soon Bydrofe would see that his attack was ineffective."
0,Chloe bought him some time as he had hoped--better than he had hoped--but it was not enough.
0,The attack was ineffective?
0,Something felt off in how Bydrofe chose to eliminate Chloe and him.
0,"Bydrofe was the Guardian of Whinhlem, a known being if immeasurable power."
0,"And yet, that attack was incredibly weak."
0,"The scale and power came solely from Bydrofe’s size and could be countered by a single fire mage, albeit a powerful fire mage."
0,"Jethro could imagine any of the earth mages in his army, should they be scaled up to the size of Bydrofe, they could accomplish the same or better."
0,"“I cannot supply you any faster, and you are also at your capacity,” Keeya finally replied."
0,"If that was true, Jethro’s plan was impossible."
0,"His former hope was to catch Bydrofe unawares using instantaneous magic, but that was no longer possible."
0,"If his capacity was simply too small, he could still cast a spell outside his capacity if he broke it down into its sub-formulae and initiate each as Keeya refilled his ven, but then Bydrofe could detect and counter."
0,Bydrofe was an incredible spatial mage…
0,…or was he?
0,The spatial ven signature Jethro felt when Bydrofe appeared was similar if not identical to the portal on the altar beside him.
0,What if Bydrofe had not cast the magic itself but had a similar portal at his former location.
0,"“This might still be possible, but it’s a gamble."
0,"Keep me topped off,” he asked Keeya."
0,"Now he only needed time, far more time than Chloe had provided."
0,Bydrofe stabbed his hand into the mountainous crown and slowly started pulling the entire south face of the steep mountain towards the square.
0,He did not have time.
0,Jethro began casting the preliminary steps of the largest transmission spell he had ever created while simultaneously completing the formulation of the final steps.
0,"He felt his ven levels plummet, but Keeya kept them steadily rising."
0,He was now racing against whatever unknown time he had until the mountain face fell and crushed his entire army.
1,A streak blacker than the night sky above flew down from the top of the mountain crown.
0,The Aspect of Death saw the destruction of the square where Ceil’s companions were gathered.
0,He quickly spotted them still on the altar platform unharmed.
0,"They were prostrate against the stone, unable to rise or defend themselves, all except Jethro who could never be affected by the divine pressure of Whinhlem’s god, being from a different world."
0,"“Weak fools, succumbing to borrowed power,” the Aspect of Death chuckled."
0,He dove down with incredible speed and impaled Ceil’s staff into the arm peeling away the sheer mountain face.
0,"As the Aspect of Death, he felt compelled to fulfill Ceil’s dying wish, and should the mountain fall on her companions, they would certainly die."
0,"The once divine flesh of the titan resisted the corrosion at first, but he was the Aspect of Death."
0,"The rot soon spread, and Bydrofe took notice of the tiny body on his arm."
0,He released his grip on the mountain and swung his arm with all his strength.
0,The Aspect of Death was flung off at incredible speed.
0,"He tried to slow himself using Ceil’s fairy wings, but it was not enough."
0,"He collided with the rooftops of the top tier of the ancient ruins, cracking and breaking stone."
0,He bounced off roofs and walls and crashed down into the lower tiers of the city.
0,All that remained of Ceil’s body was a heap of mangled flesh and scraps of fabric and leather.
0,The nearby afarit who were too far from Bydrofe to succumb to his pressure neared the gory heap out of fear and curiosity.
0,"A wave of miasma spread from the body, and all those caught within melted into black sludge."
0,Their bones crumbled.
0,"Even the stone cracked, losing its binding strength."
0,"When the miasma returned, the once mangled body regrew into what it once had been."
0,The Aspect of Death sat up and inspected his body once more.
0,"“A very inconvenient body, indeed, only having life magic."
0,Seeking another should be priority.”
0,He looked around at the fleeing afarit.
0,"None of them were appealing, as they only had fire magic."
0,He would be worse off with one of them.
0,"Ceil’s black wings manifested, and the Aspect of Death flew back toward Bydrofe who was still fighting to suppress the slow decay eating up his arm."
0,"“You have fallen farther from divinity than I ever could have hoped, Bydrofe."
0,"I never did get to see the results before Gaea struck me down,” the Aspect of Death said as he hovered not far in front of Bydrofe’s distressed face."
0,“To see you in such a pitiful state… What happened to the divine titan who laid waste to my perfect empire?”
0,Bydrofe’s eyes narrowed into a furious glare.
0,"“Surmal,” he realized."
0,“You know that the created cannot rise against their creator.”
0,“Drop the tired rhetoric.
0,You are not our creator.
0,Gaea is.
0,"You, in your pitiful state, can only borrow a fraction of her divine power now, and it no longer can suppress me.”"
0,"The Aspect of Death flapped his wings, sending a wave of miasma at Bydrofe’s unguarded face."
0,"Bydrofe howled, making Jethro’s ears ring."
0,"The widow had somehow survived and was now single-handedly fighting the titan, but Jethro could not tell who was stronger."
0,"Although the wife had peculiar magic that could break his barriers without effort, she had been weak, so he could not trust her to defeat Bydrofe."
0,"However, her intervention bought him enough time to finish the formula and cast the last of the preliminary steps."
0,"Now, he could activate the transmission."
0,Jethro was gambling on whether Bydrofe had the spatial magic competency to block it.
0,"Should it activate, he could not send the titan somewhere on Whinhlem."
0,That would only delay the destruction.
0,"So long as Jethro sent Bydrofe somewhere he did not know, Bydrofe would have no way to return."
0,Jethro understood this well.
0,"A teleportation trace was left at the location of origin, not at the destination; otherwise, he could have gone home long ago."
0,"Bydrofe blew the Aspect of Death away tumbling through the air using wind magic, but in flight and with the nullifying ability of the few resfahil plates clinging to the remaining scraps of armor he was able to right himself and dash back."
0,"Before he could reach the titan, he sensed an immense spatial distortion with a distinct teleportation signature."
0,Everything around Bydrofe was slowly being drawn in towards the writhing titan.
0,Jethro had cast some form of teleportation magic.
0,"The Aspect of Death could not lose his target; not after waiting ages for his strength to return; not after waiting even longer to find a compatible twin-soul who could bear him, only to be trapped in the frail body of a woman who simply would not die no matter how hard he tried to make her loathe her very existence; not after the only other possibility of possessing her first offspring failed when the emperor whom she wed refused to lay with her."
0,He could not let Bydrofe escape.
0,"The Aspect of Death drew all the strength he could into the black wings, but something held him back."
0,Two arms reached around from behind him and held across his chest.
0,"They were not physical but bore a strength of soul, a soul stronger than his."
0,"“You cannot take her with you,” a familiar woman’s voice spoke from behind him."
0,"“Fine,” the Aspect of death said as he pulled himself from Ceil’s body into a cloud of miasma, “but remember, the dead will forever belong to me.”"
0,"He wanted a new body anyway, and there was a prime target right in front of him."
0,His cloud of miasma raced forward and let itself get pulled into the transmission’s suction.
0,"After a snap like the crack of thunder, the titan vanished."
0,"The black of Ceil’s wings faded to a dull, ashen grey."
0,"Their strength faded, and the body slowly descended, building momentum until Ceil’s lifeless body crashed through the crumbling roof of a ruined abode not far from the grand square."
0,Chapter 25
0,“Declaration of War”
1,"“Forty-eight minutes ago, we received word of a nuclear-level explosion."
0,This is the satellite image taken eleven minutes ago.”
0,Eydis watched the large screen at the end of the conference table in the White House Situation Room.
0,It displayed a distant image of a mountain range.
0,"Near the center, a long tail of cloud, debris, or dust ran westward until curving south."
0,“Do we know if it was nuclear?”
0,"“No, Mr. President."
0,The common double-flash nature of nuclear explosions was not detected by satellites.
0,Only a single flash registered.”
0,“What about volcanic?”
0,“Unlikely given the nearest fault lines.”
0,"Despite the military’s order that information access would be restricted to Eydis, she had been called to this meeting along with Sean, Miriam, and Symra solely because the explosion happened right over Gullivan."
0,"No one wanted to believe Whinhlem was involved, but given the location, those who called the meeting could think of few other possibilities."
0,"A couple of the top heads among the military and government personnel were missing due to the urgency of the meeting, given the explosion happened on United States soil."
0,"Adding further urgency to the meeting, everyone but Symra and Eydis felt un unnatural pull westward in the direction of the explosion."
0,"The sensation carried an irresistible feeling of submission and fealty, like there was an unknown something or someone there that they had no choice but to obey."
0,"That feeling was telling them to act, and act quickly."
0,"“No magic of that scale exists on Whinhlem,” Eydis added to the discussion."
0,"If not Whinhlem, from where did the explosion originate?"
0,This question hung on the faces of many around the table.
0,"“If it was nuclear, why Gullivan?”"
0,“It would have had to be a personal device.
0,No ICBMs were detected.”
0,"“We are still awaiting radiation readings, but we have been unable to get close to ground zero,” the man at the screen replied."
0,“You can see how the dust trail curves south.
0,A massive storm is building not unlike a hurricane with Gullivan at the epicenter.
0,"Although air seems stable at the eye, at about a thirty-mile radius, the windspeeds have already reached category five at the time of this photo and are expected to rise further.”"
0,“Was this caused by the explosion?”
0,“Could it be some experimental weather-controlling technology or magic?”
0,“What of the people?
0,"How many are still in danger, and how can we rescue them?” the President asked."
0,“What of the survivors?”
0,"“Until the storm dies, we likely cannot reach them.”"
0,"“We need to know if this threat is foreign--international-foreign,” the Secretary of Defense elaborated, “or from Whinhlem.” He looked at Eydis with narrow eyes."
0,She had endured his glare plenty of times before.
0,"After all, she had brought a war from her world to Earth."
0,"“I will go,” Eydis said."
0,"“No,” Miriam protested."
0,"“I advise against it,” Symra added."
0,Eydis glanced at Symra’s prosthetic arm.
0,"The last time Eydis ignored Symra’s council, Symra got hurt, but this time, Eydis would be going in personally."
0,“I am the only one who can.
0,"My wind magic should keep me safe from the storm, and should there be radiation, it will have less effect on me because of my life magic."
0,My spatial magic should handle everything else.”
0,Agreement came readily from the heads around the table.
0,“When can you leave?” the Secretary of Defense asked.
0,"“Now.” The dust in the image was traveling south-west, so Eydis created a teleportation formula targeting the side of the interstate about eight miles north of Gullivan."
0,"Before anyone could stop her, she opened it there in the room and jumped through."
0,Torrential winds momentarily whipped the papers on the table around the room until Eydis closed the portal behind her.
0,* * *
1,Bydrofe lay on the slope of a massive crater carved into a mountainside.
0,"The entire air around him was clouded with dust, and debris as large as a common house continually rained from the sky."
0,He struggled to stand and found numerous lacerations draining thin ichor all over his body.
0,His insides were likewise torn.
0,"His affinity to life magic was very weak by divine standards, but it was more than sufficient to prevent his otherwise fatal injuries from killing him outright."
0,"Had Surmal not reduced him to his current state all those years ago, such injuries could have been ignored."
0,"His feet were unstable, but he managed to stand, rising taller than the nearby mountain range despite standing in a crater as deep as his shins."
0,"The night scene of the Afarit caldera was gone, replaced by a dusty midday."
0,"The dust continued to rise, carried off by the wind."
0,He cleared the dust at his feet with wind magic and notice the soil and stone did not match any formation on Whinhlem.
0,The mountain range at his back was likewise foreign.
0,"As one who had played part in the entire history of Whinhlem alongside his wife, Gaea, he knew even the minutest of details of his world."
0,"A god should have no reason to fear, but here Bydrofe was terrified."
0,He was a trespasser on another god’s world.
0,"As this realization hit him, the clouds around him changed course and spun into a massive storm."
0,"Over the passing minutes, all the land he could see from his towering height vanished in the veil of clouds."
1,"A small being no larger than a human appeared in the air before him, and Bydrofe knew immediately which world he had trespassed upon."
0,"“Kalya, forgive me,” Bydrofe began before coughing out ichor, some of it now tinted a putrid black."
0,The god before him appeared human but for her extra two arms that were folded and crossed over her bare chest.
0,Her skin held a pristine onyx tone.
0,"Her hair, darker even than her skin, was woven into a loose braid down her back and extended beyond her feet for another full length of her body, the tip whipping about in the wind."
0,A red mask bearing a merciful smile engraved in gold adorned her face.
0,"“Bydrofe, I have shown mercy on you and Gaea already for those of your world who have trespassed here."
0,My world is not so weak than such an infection cannot be cured without my aid.”
0,Kalya removed her mask.
0,Her deep golden eyes glared with a judgmental scowl at the cowering titan.
0,“However!
0,Gaea’s inability to quell the Lurr threat in your world has now led that infestation to mine.
0,Now your presence here spells further disaster!
0,"The people of my world might endure the Lurr if dealt with quickly, but it cannot endure you."
0,Already your presence and mine will hinder the progress of my world for ages to come.
0,Already the hearts of my people are drawn to me now that I am forced to intervene.
0,I must eliminate you before my world discovers you are here to prevent further damage to my design.”
0,"The mask of mercy in her hand vanished, replaced by a spear of light that grew ever larger as her hand raised above her head."
0,Nearby dust and clouds were drawn to it and coiled about its length with clashes of lightning as it grew as long as Bydrofe was tall.
0,"“Killing another god is forbidden,” Bydrofe pleaded, but Kalya would not be moved."
0,Her judgment was final.
0,"“It was Gaea who proposed these laws, and we all agreed to them for both our benefit and detriment."
0,"By striking you down, I will break no laws, for you are no longer a god.”"
0,* * *
1,Eydis continued southward portal after portal as she deemed the land safe.
0,"The air felt burnt and was nearly too hot to endure, but otherwise, once she broke through the border of wind, there was no danger."
0,She arrived in burnt plains far north of where Gullivan had once stood.
0,"The city and foothills of her memory that should have been visible in the distance were gone, replaced by a massive crater that extended far beyond the city’s outer farmlands."
0,In the city’s place stood a towering figure that grew ever more visible as the dust in the air was drawn into a massive glowing spear shrouded in storm clouds and lightning.
0,"Eydis had never met him, because as her father explained, “The indoctrination you would receive upon your visitation will be detrimental to your future.” She did not know him, but she knew of him, both by the education she had received as a child and by the innate reverence she felt towards him."
0,"This was Bydrofe, the Guardian of Whinhlem."
0,The massive spear thrown by a hand too small and far for her to see struck Bydrofe through the chest.
0,The pull Eydis felt toward her guardian deity vanished as the titan fell into the broken mountainside and the spear dispersed.
0,"The sight drew tears from the corners of Eydis’s eyes, and she fell to her knees."
0,"“Do you judge me, daughter of Whinhlem, for striking down Bydrofe,” a voice spoke into her mind."
0,"“I could never think of judging the Guardian of Earth,” Eydis managed to reply, quickly wiping her tears."
0,"As Eydis wondered what would become of Whinhlem now that its guardian had fallen, the titan pushed himself up from the mountain."
0,A massive burnt hole remained in his chest oozing rivers of black.
0,"In place of the reverence that Eydis had felt, Bydrofe’s body now radiated a creeping darkness that slowly blackened the earth around him."
0,"The darkness spread quickly, and before Eydis could think to teleport away before it reached her, she found herself in a field staring at a wall of clouds miles high and hundreds of miles wide."
0,* * *
1,The Aspect of Death rejoiced in his fortune.
0,"After abandoning Ceil’s body, he struggled on his own to overtake the fallen titan god."
0,"His soul had power, but on his own against a fleshen body, his influence was limited."
0,Victory was uncertain until the god of this new world ended Bydrofe’s life for him.
0,"Now, he had his next target, another god to fell, and a new body to defeat her with."
0,He looked at the gaping hole in his chest and expelled miasma far and wide.
0,"The mountains at his back crumbled, and the burnt fields and forests beyond the crater blackened and dissolved into powder."
0,"As the miasma returned, Bydrofe’s body reformed and regained the strength it had lost from the chronic injury Surmal dealt Bydrofe long ago."
0,"Although not yet as powerful as a true god, Surmal no longer feared the god hovering in the air before him."
0,Surmal eyed the small goddess who stared back in confusion.
0,Kalya looked around her and witnessed the devastation his existence brought upon her world.
0,Bydrofe was only a threat through the terror his presence would invoke upon the people of her world.
0,This new enemy was a direct threat that could lead to her world’s destruction.
0,"Only once before had a similar threat appeared, the Lurr, and many worlds had fallen desolate to it."
0,"At that time, Earth was young, and Kalya managed to save her world through a mass extinction."
0,"Earth was still young, but her people were now more matured as she raced to see how quickly her design could cultivate a species to godhood."
0,"“All the gods are hypocrites,” Surmal spoke, enjoying the new tone of his voice, far better than the feminine chime it had been before."
0,"“The purpose of creating a world is to create more of your kind, is it not?"
0,"And yet, when a race encroaches upon you, you fear them.”"
0,"“You are blight that must be cured before your destruction spreads,” Kalya called, readying for an unknown battle against an opponent she was unsure she could defeat without having to restart her world anew once more."
0,"“I am Death,” Surmal replied, “a necessary Aspect of existence, one that the gods seem to have forgotten."
0,"You live by your rules for your own convenience, expecting your immortality and the endlessness of time to make all things right, but even you make exception when it is convenient for you.”"
0,Surmal’s glare twisted into a scowl.
0,"“The Lurr, who even you stated are a threat to the worlds, are invaders whose influence must be eliminated by your divine law."
0,I and my people were creations of Gaea who were reaching the purpose of our creation.
0,"Yet, why was it that I and my people had to die when Gaea and Bydrofe let the Lurr live?”"
0,Kalya could not answer.
0,"In her judgement, the Lurr should have been dealt with, and yet Gaea alone let them survive on her world."
0,All other worlds either eliminated them or fell to them and had to be destroyed.
0,"“It is because you fear those like you,” Surmal answered in Kalya’s silence."
0,“Is that not why you forbid interference between other gods and create your worlds so far apart?
0,"Oh, right."
0,Interference is okay if you see them as less than you and they are beneficial.
0,Is that not why the gods enslaved the sprites?”
0,Surmal laughed.
0,"“Many of you gods could never manage your worlds on your own without their help, the titans most of all with their weak elemental affinities."
0,I can sense that even you employ several.
0,Why not have them eliminate me in your stead?”
0,"Kalya considered it, but pulling the sprites from their tasks came with an equivalent risk which Surmal immediately voiced."
0,"“You can’t, because by your own inability, your world would destabilize without them.”"
0,Surmal crouched down and spread his arms as if lifting a massive weight over his back.
0,“I think it is time that the current generation of gods ends and the next rises.
0,"No doubt the sprites after their eons of servitude, and others like them living under the fear that their creators harbor for them, could manage their world more peaceably.”"
0,"Instead of attacking Surmal, Kalya shrouded herself in a divine barrier as miles of mountains rose and crushed her from both sides."
0,* * *
1,All nearby gods felt an immense sense of foreboding from the world governed by Kalya.
0,"Such an ill omen had not been felt since the advent of the Lurr, or more precisely, the destruction of Lurr’s world at the hands of gods who believed that Lurr, who lacked a physical form or divine ability, had no right to govern a world."
0,"Those who had lost their former worlds to the Lurr threat began immediate preparations to protect their new, young worlds."
0,Those who had resisted the Lurr threat held confidence in their mature worlds and watched with judgmental eyes.
0,Only one goddess watched the events on Earth without thought of the imminent danger.
0,"Gaea had always watched her world like a master admiring her garden, often unattentive as she let Bydrofe tend to it in her stead."
0,"She had observed listlessly Bydrofe’s confrontation with the trespassers after he enquired about the elven house he had so meticulously cultivated, relaying the answer she received from the sprites who acted as her eyes and ears on the surface."
0,"She did not doubt that Bydrofe could defeat simple mortals, but then he vanished."
0,She felt the divine authority she had given him emanating from Kalya’s world.
0,Gaea could only watch as Kalya struck her husband down in the name of justice and divine law.
0,All titans who managed worlds of their own governed by rule of strength.
0,Only the most powerful of sentient species could gain the god’s favor and be nurtured.
0,"Gaea saw such rule as barbaric, and for this reason she was scorned."
0,Only Bydrofe shared her view that greater strength came from diversity.
0,Together they founded a world on the far rim of a galaxy far from the influence of other gods to prove their vision.
0,"There they proved Gaea’s theory in the advent of the Lurr when only her world, which contained numerous sentient species, managed a symbiotic relationship while others could only eliminate the threat or fall."
0,"Bydrofe helped make her dream a reality, but now she watched the only man who shared in that dream, the man she grew to cherish more than her dream, perish."
0,"All of Whinhlem felt Gaea’s immense anguish, then anger."
0,"In a divine declaration to all gods, for the murder of Bydrofe she promised the destruction of Kalya and all her worlds, both past and current."
0,And so began the first War of the Gods.
0,Conclusion of
0,ACT 1
0,Epilogue
0,“A Title Bestowed unto Oneself”
1,Ephora grew tired of the panicking sprites around her and the crying children who mimicked the fear.
0,"She, herself, was so far beyond panic that she felt only exhaustion."
0,"“I have made a summons,” the Arkhon told her."
0,“This is beyond what we can cope with now.”
0,"Despite the graveness of the first declaration of war between gods, the Arkhon seemed happier than he had ever been, and that disgusted Ephora, although she withheld from showing it."
0,Ephora did not have to wait long before a woman appeared in the garden amid the children.
0,"She wore a simple loose, sleeveless gown of modest white tied with a tan sash."
0,"She appeared as human if not for the presence she emanated that transcended the divine, but that presence was not oppressive but comforting, bearing a deep love for all things."
0,“Is she truly the Allmother?” Ephora asked Arkhon.
0,"“Only an image,” the Allmother replied as she walked among the children."
0,Each child that saw her stopped crying immediately.
0,"She tousled an older child’s hair as she passed, and the boy giggled as if Gaea’s oppressive voice he had just heard and the panic of the sprites never happened."
0,“No world could endure me if I came in person.
0,"Even now, my time here is short, and once I leave, I can never return.”"
0,She stood before Ephora who could not help but be drawn in.
0,"Before Ephora realized her own actions, she was embraced in the Allmother’s hands against her bosom."
0,"“How could our predictions have gone so wrong?” she asked, spilling her troubles and guilt."
0,"Their foresight was still blind, and Ephora was to blame for it."
0,“Your Arkhon has told me that you have an anomaly.
0,"Can you show me?” the Allmother asked, lifting Ephroa from her bosom and cradling her in her hands to speak with her at eye level."
0,Ephora nodded and led the Allmother to where Sammy’s dissected body remained suspended in time.
0,The Allmother viewed the body for only a moment.
0,“Nothing is wrong.
0,She is a simple human from Kalya’s world.”
0,The Arkhon’s grin grew wider as Ephora grew more distressed.
0,“How can that be?” Ephora cried.
0,“Sammy Thompson was the cause of all this.”
0,"“Sammy Thompson is not here,” the Allmother replied."
0,“This is only the mortal shell she had used in life.”
0,"As Ephora contemplated what the Allmother said, the Allmother’s attention changed to a peculiar black curse locked within a barrier."
0,It’s tendril-like arms grasped at nothing but always pointed just off from north.
0,“What is this?” she asked.
0,"The Arkhon spun through the air, ecstatic beyond reason that he could show the Allmother something unknown to her."
0,"“This!” he exclaimed, raising the spherical barrier above his head and spinning it like a ball."
0,"Throughout the spinning, the black mist continued reaching north."
0,“This is a weak but unique curse created using death magic cast on Sammy.”
0,"“And it is not drawn to her body,” the Allmother observed as she paced around the Arkhon."
0,"“Then what is it drawn to,” Ephora asked."
0,"“Sammy Thompson,” the Allmother replied."
0,“She is still on Whinhlem and has not moved on.
0,Her soul must be quite stable.”
0,"“Let’s find her!” The Arkhon immediately vanished, and Ephora quickly followed."
0,The Allmother simply smiled at her adorable little children and quickly followed as well.
0,* * *
1,All mortals on Whinhlem who heard Gaea’s declaration cowered.
0,"None knew who Kalya was, and most knew Bydrofe, but only those at the Afarit knew Bydrofe was injured and somehow vanished."
0,"Released from the divine pressure they were bound under, the surviving afarit around the square rose to eliminate the party they suspected was the cause of Bydrofe’s downfall, the cause of the anguish of their Goddess."
0,The Tolmyur army who had cheered their commanding general for eliminating the threat to their lives now fought under the command of General Byurk a losing battle against the seemingly innumerable afarit.
0,They could not fight their way around the massive section of city that lay in ruins across the center of the square to reach their Commanding General.
0,"Jethro fought alongside the survivors of Ceil’s party against the afarit horde, solely to safeguard the unconscious Chloe whose power and ability he could not help but respect."
0,"However, he knew a losing battle."
0,He quickly checked the detection barrier in the teleportation room of his home in Tolmyur to make certain it was clear and sent Chloe there.
0,"As Jethro was contemplating who else and how many he could save among his army as the slaughter intensified and Keeya continually replenished his ven, all feelings of hostility ceased."
0,"As if everyone engaged in combat had decided to stop at the same time, weapons dropped, magic extinguished, and the ignited veins of the afarit cooled."
0,Atop the rubble crossing the long city square stood a single woman.
0,"Beside her, two wind sprites floated, one carrying a strange orb."
0,"“Over here,” called a voice behind Jethro."
0,A small whisp of flame led a suspended corpse Jethro recognized immediately as Ceil.
0,"As the whisp neared, Jethro saw it was a flame sprite."
0,The sprite passed through Jethro’s external barrier with the body as if the barrier wasn’t there.
0,He placed the body across the altar whose portal had long since disappeared.
0,The woman of unfathomable presence slowly walked towards the altar platform with the two sprites in tow.
0,"None hindered her, not the afarit nor Ceil’s party."
0,She passed Jethro with a warm and caring smile that felt as if she understood and sympathized with all the pain Jethro had experienced.
0,"The male wind sprite with the orb containing black, mist-like tendrils ignored him completely, but the female sprite stopped in front of his face."
0,"A faint worry shot across Jethro’s mind, but the calm he felt so close to the mysterious woman prevented him from taking defensive action."
0,"Although this sprite looked different, the sprite from Earth came to mind."
0,"“We need to stop you from causing any more problems until we figure out what’s going on,” the sprite said as she placed her hand on Jethro’s forehead."
0,His worry became reality all too quickly.
0,"He felt all his ven freeze--not just his teleportation magic, but all his magic was blocked."
0,His connection to Keeya was frozen.
0,"His outer barrier disappeared, allowing Ceil’s companions to surround her corpse."
0,Jethro had never felt so vulnerable.
0,"Thankfully, the calming aura prevented anyone from retaliating against him."
0,"“Oh, and there are probably going to be things you shouldn’t hear, so sleep for now.”"
0,Jethro blacked out and fell backwards onto the stone platform.
0,At least Ephora was kind enough to cushion his fall.
0,* * *
1,"At the request of Thanysa, Tyree quickly checked Ceil’s vitals."
0,"“Ceil is dead,” Tyree said to the mourning party."
0,"They had a resurgence of hope when Ceil appeared seemingly healthy and fighting Bydrofe to protect them, but sure enough, falling from that height had been fatal."
0,The lone High Elf of the Vallen guard who survived the ordeal fell to his knees.
0,Tae dropped before the altar and cried into her arms.
0,"Benab turned his back to Ceil and instead stood over Jethro, but no matter how he tried, he could not muster the will to strike down his vulnerable enemy."
0,He likewise wanted to ask what Jethro had done with Chloe but couldn’t.
0,Basara held Zose who was just coherent enough to understand that he had failed his mission.
0,"Thanysa turned to Ephora whom she recognized as the one who had been in contact with Ceil and Chloe, the one who told them Jethro should not be killed."
0,“What should we do now?
0,"What kind of future awaits us?” A war between gods, one that involved her world, had been declared, and Thanysa could only see this as the worst possible outcome caused by the death of those who were vital to mitigate this calamity."
0,Ephora did not know how to respond.
0,She did not want to give false hope nor further wound the troubled emotions of this party.
0,"The Arkhon continued forward, and as he circled the altar, the curse continually reached out towards Ceil’s body."
0,"In a spurt of inspiration, he removed the encasing barrier."
0,“What are you doing?
0,"!” Ephora screamed, but she failed to contain the curse before it entered Ceil’s body."
0,“What’s the harm?” the Arkhon smirked.
0,"“Ceil’s already dead, so it’s not like it can make her more dead."
0,"Besides, while you spent all your time studying Sammy’s mortal shell,” he emphasized using the Allmother’s words, “I was studying this curse.”"
0,"“What kind of curse is it,” the Allmother asked."
0,"“A rather benign one, in all actuality."
0,"It only causes illness, nightmares, exhaustion--anything to make living uncomfortable."
0,"Ceil cast it on Sammy to make Sammy suffer, back when Ceil directed her hatred toward the whole of humanity.”"
0,“How is that important here?
0,I thought it was supposed to lead to Sammy?” Ephora questioned.
0,“That is what I am hoping to find--”
1,A swift hand lashed out and grabbed the Arkhon.
0,"Despite being the wind, the hand clasping him held him firm and prevented his body from dispersing."
0,Ceil leaned forward and looked at him with a wide smile.
0,“I got you!
0,"I caught you, Arkhon."
0,I finally caught you!” she exclaimed.
0,"“Lady Ceil!” Thanysa dropped to her knees and clasped Ceil’s outstretched arm with gentle, trembling hands."
0,The others raised their dejected faces and stared at the miracle.
0,"“Your eyes are as beautiful as always,” Ceil said to Thanysa who was staring with tear-filled eyes."
0,"“Sorry to disappoint you, but I’m not Ceil.”"
0,The Arkhon rested his one free elbow on Ceil’s forefinger and leaned his head against his hand.
0,"A warm, fatherly smile spread across his lips."
0,"“Welcome back, Sammy,” he said."
0,““Sammy?”” both Ephora and Thanysa repeated in near unison.
0,“Then where is Lady Ceil?” Thanysa asked.
0,"“She’s still here,” Sammy replied as she fully sat up and turned to let her legs hang off the altar."
0,"“God, this body is stiff.” She rotated her shoulders and stretched her arms, still holding onto the Arkhon with one hand."
0,“She’s just sleeping for now.”
0,"“When Ceil died, that bastard Surmal locked Ceil in her body so she couldn’t pass on."
0,I guess he needed access to her magic or something.
0,"I don’t really understand it all,” Sammy tried to explain."
0,"“Most know that when a body dies, the ven within it disperses."
0,"However, the truth is that ven is less connected to the physical but more relates to the soul,” the Allmother explained."
0,Sammy’s eyes lit up.
0,"“That’s why the flow is different or why the wellpoint in the forehead that’s supposed to be connected to the soul makes reading ven easier, right?"
0,At least that’s what Eydis taught me.
0,"Wait, then what about Justin’s condition?"
0,How does that relate to all this?”
0,Sammy looked around but could not find him.
0,“Where is he?”
0,"“He’s in Tolmyur,” the Arkhon explained."
0,Sammy moved the Arkhon in front of her face.
0,“Seriously?
0,"God damnit, I wanted to surprise him…” A longing smile graced her lips."
0,“I know my death has caused him a lot of pain.”
0,"Sammy took a deep breath, exhaled slowly, and then rested the Arkhon in her lap, refusing to release him."
0,"“Anyway, back to Ceil."
0,"When Bydrofe was about to be teleported away, Surmal was going to drag Ceil with and then dump her somewhere when he found a body he liked better."
0,Like hell I was going to let that happen.
0,She’s still stuck in here!
0,"So, I made him choose between Bydrofe and Ceil.”"
0,"“You had the strength to hold back the Aspect of Death,” the Allmother said, her eyes narrowing."
0,“I guess so?
0,"Well, there was this emptiness in Ceil that was left behind when he left, so I kind of just claimed it."
0,"I now understand a bit why Surmal was so pissed at Ceil, though."
0,"Even though Ceil was dead, I couldn’t break through."
0,"It was like she was asleep at the wheel, and I was stuck in the back seat."
0,"That is, until something that reeeaaalllly wanted to get to me suddenly appeared and pulled me to the front.” She glared annoyedly down at the Arkhon, but then she smiled."
0,“Thanks!
0,I don’t think I could have done it on my own.
0,"Ceil is more stubborn than me at times, I guess especially so when asleep.”"
0,"“Considering the curse carries Ceil’s will, I can understand how it unlocked the metaphorical cage and pulled you to the surface."
0,"For now,” the Arkhon drew the curse once more from Ceil’s body and entrapped it as before, “it is still harmful."
0,"Once Ceil wakes, she should be able to let you out whenever she wants."
0,"Just don’t go seclude yourself until she does, or you might find yourself stuck again.”"
0,"None but the two sprites and the Allmother understood Sammy’s analogy or the Arkhon’s explanation, so Ephora elaborated."
0,“Ceil is a twin-soul.
0,Bydrofe had been cultivating the Amel line to produce elves with a larger strength of soul after Surmal successfully ripped him from godhood by damaging his soul.
0,He wanted to understand the nature of souls better to prevent the same from happening again.”
0,"“He never truly succeeded, but a side effect was the rare appearance along the elven line of those who had room for two souls in a single body,” the Arkhon explained further."
0,“Ceil’s two tails are a physical indicator of this rare trait.”
0,"“Anyway, I am going to let Ceil rest for as long as she needs."
0,"She’s tired after everything that’s happened,” Sammy said."
0,"“Does this mean Ceil is still alive,” Zose asked as Basara carried him closer with his good arm over her shoulder."
0,"“No, we’re both still very much dead,” Sammy said with a light chuckle."
0,"“Ceil is way too cute for me to call us a zombie, and I think terms like living dead are stupid ‘cause it’s a blatant oxymoron."
0,"I think Surmal has something to do with this, but I don’t know what it is.”"
0,"“She is right,” Tyree confirmed."
0,“I still sense no life from Ceil’s body.” She grasped Sammy’s free hand to check her vitals and then placed her hand on Sammy’s forehead for a better reading.
0,“Her body is functioning as normal but lacks the essence of life.
0,I cannot explain it.”
0,“I guess it’s not all that important anyway.” Sammy brushed off her startling declaration.
0,"Tyree confirmed that she and Ceil could act as normal, so that was all Sammy cared about."
0,"“Your young anomaly is quite anomalous indeed,” the Allmother said with an understanding grin."
0,“Have you learned why Sammy is invisible to our foresight?” Ephora asked.
0,“Are there any other beings whose actions are difficult for you to read or calculate?” she asked back.
0,"“None,” Ephora replied flatly."
0,"“You are thinking too narrow,” the Allmother kindly admonished."
0,"“The gods,” Arkhon answered."
0,“But Sammy is not a god.”
0,“What about those not unlike the gods that are more prone to rampant action driven by their natures?”
0,Arkhon understood immediately.
0,"Ever since the Lurr rampaged over the universe, he had studied these bizarre Aspects of Being."
0,He wriggled himself free from Sammy’s grip and floated in front of her face.
0,He kept his composure calm to not alert Ephora he had discovered the reason.
0,She was still contemplating the Allmother’s cryptic answer.
0,"“Sammy, do you remember the bet we made back in Fiorrae?”"
0,Sammy looked confusedly at him.
0,She had already thought their bet was over after what happened in Melia.
0,He had given her a hollow victory and rewarded her with understanding over languages.
0,“What was your reason for taking that bet?” he asked.
0,“You said I was unimportant.
0,"You wanted to sacrifice me for some pointless test to see if Ceil would kill me!” Sammy replied, some of the anger of the past welling up in her."
0,“I wanted to prove to you that I was important.
0,I wanted to show you that I could change the future.”
0,The Arkhon smiled warmly.
0,"“A powerful soul, heightened by a strong, pure desire that becomes the focus of your actions."
0,"Our bet became the catalyst for you to develop your entelechy, an innate power that refines the possible into actuality and leads to the fulfillment of your potential."
0,A pure entelechy is the root of every Aspect of Being.”
0,"Sammy understood nothing that the Arkhon told her, but Ephor quickly realized what the Allmother wanted them to discover, what the Arkhon had discovered immediately given the pointed hints."
0,"“In all our foresight, we had been wrong in predicting the most suitable candidate."
0,It was not Chloe but Sammy!” the Arkhon exclaimed with an areal cartwheel.
0,“Prytanis!”
0,A whisp that had brought Ceil’s body reappeared beside the Arkhon and quickly formed into a flame sprite.
0,“Chloe is at Jethro’s home in Tolmyur.
0,Observe her and nurture her entelechy.
0,See if you can indeed prove my theory.”
0,The flame sprite grew excited and vanished.
0,"“What are you saying,” Ephora said, exasperated."
0,“It cannot be so easy.”
0,"“No, this wasn’t easy."
0,It was luck.
0,Chance!
0,"It is a probability so infinitesimal that there is no way our foresight could have ever calculated it!” The Arkhon flew into the air and spun around the alter at incredible speed, releasing a small burst of wind in his excitement when he stopped."
0,“Don’t you see?
0,Sammy’s soul was stronger than ours from the start.
0,That was why we were blind to her!”
0,"The Arkhon lowered himself slowly in front of Sammy, and in a gesture of humility, he crossed his hands over his chest and bowed low."
0,"“Our bet back in Fiorrae is over, and I have lost."
0,"You have not only proven your importance, but you have also shown that your very existence is vital and irreplaceable."
0,I know you have envied the titles that the sprites have bestowed upon your friends.
0,"After your death in Revlan, we had planned to give one in your honor for finding a way to send Ceil north to the Afarit, but in the end we could not decide.”"
0,The Arkhon raised his head but remained bowed.
0,“We can now no longer bestow upon you a title because you have earned one for yourself.
0,"As payment for my loss in our bet, and on behalf of all the sprites throughout the universe, we recognize you, Sammy Marie Thompson of Earth.”"
0,"He beckoned Ephora forward, and she clasped the Arkhon’s hand."
0,Together they bowed and spoke with complete understanding of the other.
0,"““We recognize you, the nascent Aspect of Chaos.””"

1,Eydis watched the wall of storms far in the distance and felt the ongoing but subtle tremors of the unimaginable battle raging deep within.
0,"Her phone was ringing incessantly, calls from either Miriam or Sean, but she had not answered."
0,"What she saw, the death of the guardian of her world and the unknown horror who had claimed his body to fight the guardian of this world, had overwhelmed her."
0,"“The Aspect of Death’s power has far exceeded what I had assumed,” Kalya’s voice spoke into Eydis’s mind, momentarily frightening her."
0,"“Our battle will be prolonged, so I must request of you a favor.”"
0,“What favor could I possibly provide the Guardian of Earth?” Eydis asked.
0,"After seeing the attack that struck down Bydrofe in a single blow, there should be nothing beyond Kalya’s power to perform."
0,And Eydis was not from Earth.
0,She was a trespasser on Kalya’s domain.
0,"“The Aspect of Death is a great threat, but another danger from your world remains on Earth that perhaps you may be able to solve.”"
0,"“What is it you ask of me,” Eydis replied, bowing to the ground in the direction of the wall of storms."
0,“You know of the Lurr who had once impersonated you.
0,She is pregnant.
0,"Before Lurr can infest this world and lead it to ruin, you must eliminate her and all her spawn."
0,"In all the peoples of my world, only you hold knowledge of the Lurr."
0,"Should you successfully complete your task, I will return to you your loved ones, Chloe and Justin, and permit you to live with them here on my world.”"
0,Eydis’s eyes grew wide.
0,"As tears quickly formed and dripped off her eyelashes into the grass, she readily accepted the task Kalya had given her."
