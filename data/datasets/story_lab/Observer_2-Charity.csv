1,The sun beat down with anger on the countryside.
0,"My mouth and throat were dry, and I hated it because I could do nothing about it."
0,I kept to the shade of the trees as I travelled.
0,"When the trees led away from the road, I had to make a choice: continue following the road or follow the trees."
0,I looked at the sky where the sun only seemed to grow the longer I looked.
0,My choice was the trees.
1,"I had traveled cross country before, but roads led somewhere."
0,There was no guarantee of finding a town when you stepped off them.
0,The shade was relieving.
0,"Tall pine trees blocked out the sun's anger, and I was finally able to relax."
0,I took a moment to sit down on a fallen log.
0,"Setting the rolled quilt to my side, I lay down and picked the needles from my toes."
0,The ambient sway of the branches and singing of the birds hypnotized me.
0,"Feeling that if this heat were to persist, it would be better to travel at night, I let sleep take me."
0,"In my sleep, I dreamed of fire and the small cottage on the hill."
0,"The three bodies in the kitchen were seared into my memory, and try as I might, they would not fade."
0,I awoke in sweat.
0,My hand found the burn hole on my sleeve I had gained from charging into that inferno.
0,I regretted returning.
0,Why did I make my final memory of the couple one of pain and sadness?
1,The sky was now darkened.
0,"Not knowing how long I had been asleep, I picked up the quilt and continued walking in the darkness of the forest."
0,The stars and full moon provided adequate light.
0,"From time to time, small flashing insects lit my path."
0,Onward I travelled until sunrise.
1,"In the far distance, the tall pines stopped at a wall lit orange with the rising sun."
0,I could not see the top at my distance.
0,"Curious, I continued until I stood at its base."
0,The wall towered as high as the trees.
0,"On top, a man in armor noticed me."
0,"""What are you doing boy?"""
0,he called out.
0,"""What's beyond this wall?"""
0,I called back.
0,"""Paradise!"""
0,he yelled with arms wide in the air.
0,I had never been anywhere I would call paradise.
0,"In truth, I did not fully understand what he meant, but it did make me interested in getting behind that wall."
0,"""How can I get in?"""
0,I called up at him.
0,The guard pointed to my left.
0,"""A half day's walk following the wall will find you a gate."
0,"Enjoy your stay!"""
0,"Wasting no time, I ran in the direction the guard pointed."
1,"After hours of running, I was soaked with uncomfortable sweat, but in the distance I saw my target."
0,"A tower rose high from the wall, and at its base a road led to a gate crowded with people eager to get inside."
0,A large group of knights stood in front and along the path to keep order.
0,I neared the gathering and noticed the gate was closed.
0,I asked what was going on.
0,"“Back off,” the man replied."
0,"Surprised by his hostility, I decided to ask another."
0,"“End of the line,” he ordered."
0,"Not wanting to cause a commotion, I moved to the end."
1,"After a long wait, a knight at the front with a blue cape called for order."
0,"“We are opening the gate,” he called."
0,“We have a quota of twenty today.
0,The remainder will be asked to leave.”
0,This announcement caused a large commotion among those waiting.
0,There had to be close to a hundred people at the gate with more arriving as we waited.
0,The knights at the front selected the first ten in line and walked them to the gate.
0,Those selected praised and thanked the guards while the others left behind pleaded to be taken with.
0,The knights drew their weapons to hold back the throng as the chosen few were walked through the gate into the tower.
0,"Instead of selecting the next ten in line, the knight in charge walked along the length of the group."
0,"At his command, individuals were selected and brought to the front of the line."
0,"His selection followed no reason, at least that I could follow."
0,"Husbands were selected without their wives, and parents were chosen but had to leave their children behind, yet despite the separation, no one chose to stay with their loved ones."
0,What was inside those walls that they would give up family to see?
0,Or did they even know?
0,I sat on the stony road in back and watched as one by one the remaining ten were selected.
0,The majority were chosen before the knight was even half way down the line.
0,The chance he would make it back to me was far out of my favor.
0,"I had come here on whim, and though I also desired to see what it was that all these people yearned to see and what the guard on the wall called paradise, I would be no worse off not seeing it."
0,"I turned my back to the wall and walked down the road, letting those behind me have my place in line."
0,"“Young Lad,” the knight called from behind."
0,“Would you walk away from the gate before all have been selected?”
0,The entire crowd turned to face my direction.
0,I nodded in reply and kept walking.
0,"“Come here,” he called."
0,"Following his order, I walked past the crowd of people and stood in front of the knight."
0,"Those near him pleaded their cause, whether poor, famished, or homeless, but the knight paid them no mind."
0,He placed his hand on my shoulder and walked me to the gate.
0,"“You are the twentieth.” Turning to the crowd he called out, “You are all to return to your own lands."
0,Any resistance will be met with equal force in measure.”
1,The knight walked me past the raised gate to a hallway that turned right along the breadth of the wall.
0,The land behind the wall was not visible to those outside.
0,"Once inside the tower, the gate began to lower."
0,"At the far end of the hall, light was visible, but there was another gate half way where the other nineteen had gathered in waiting."
0,"Once I joined the group, the knight walked to the front to address the new arrivals."
0,"“Welcome guests,” he spoke in a voice that echoed through the stone corridor."
0,“You all have been chosen to witness the glory of the most charitable nation in the land.”
0,The excitement swelled in the crowd as the gate behind us closed.
0,An uneasy feeling crawled in my stomach.
0,Four guards walked down the corridor and stopped at the other side of the gate.
0,"""Now,"" the knight continued, ""upon exiting, there will be a money exchange."
0,Those who brought foreign currency will be asked to exchange it for our coin by metal weight.
0,"The rates are high, but worry not, you will be handed a large sum of gold to spend at your leisure as gift from us."""
0,This announcement was also well received.
0,The joyous voices echoed in the corridor until the knight raised his hand.
0,"""I ask for your patience as we enter the kingdom."
0,"When the gate is open, I will escort you out the wall and to the coin exchange."
0,Any weapons you carry will be confiscated.
0,You are to sign your name and receive a mark on your hand.
0,Each day you must return here or the mark will fade.
0,"Should you let it fade, and a villager or guard notice, you will be reported a criminal and taken into custody."
0,"As such, it is vital you return."
0,"For an added incentive, you will receive another sum of gold for that day."""
0,Happy cries rang out again.
0,The Knight turned to the gate prompting the guards to work the cranks.
0,"Once open, we were surrounded by the guards and escorted behind the knight to the opening at the end of the corridor."
1,A low wall surrounded the small courtyard blocking our view of the inner kingdom.
0,On the other side was the exchange.
0,The guests entered one by one as prompted by the guards.
0,I stood at the back wondering what I would do with the gold given me.
0,It had been a luxury I never had the pleasure of owning.
0,"When my time was approaching, I turned to the knight with the blue cape and pointed at the quilt rolled up under my arm."
0,"""You are not going to confiscate this, are you?"""
0,The knight looked at the quilt.
0,"""We have no laws against blankets."
0,"Are you hiding a weapon in it?"""
0,I shook my head.
0,"""Then there is no problem."""
0,The knight placed his hand on my back.
0,"""Your turn."
0,"I'll walk you through the process."""
1,He walked with me inside and led me to a table.
0,"""You will get your money here."""
0,An old bearded man in a red robe cocked his head at me from the stool on the other side.
0,"""A young one,"" He said in a graveled voice."
0,"""Have you any gold or silver for scales or other forms of foreign currency?"""
0,I shook my head.
0,The old man stroked his beard.
0,"""Figured as much."
0,You look like you haven't a mite to your name.
0,"Where do you come from, child."""
0,"""Nowhere,"" I replied."
0,"""Ah,"" he replied."
0,"""You sure know how to pick them,"" The old man said, looking at the knight."
0,"""Anyone who would walk away from a chance in paradise has surely lost all hope,"" the knight replied patting my shoulder."
0,"""Maybe the week here will give him a better outlook on life."""
0,"""Give me your hand,"" the old man requested."
0,"I held out my left arm and a tall, thin man also wearing a red robe walked over."
0,"""What color?"""
0,he asked.
0,The old man stroked his beard.
0,"""Blue,"" the knight responded."
0,The old man nodded in agreement.
0,"Dipping a brush in a pouch at his waist, the tall man drew a strange character on the back of my hand in a shimmering blue dye."
0,I did not recognize it.
0,The symbol hooked on the right before running sideways looping up over itself and downward.
0,The tail was crossed perpendicularly by a wavy line with curled tips.
0,"""What does it mean?"""
0,I asked the tall man.
0,"""This is the marking you must return to receive daily,"" the knight responded as the man who had painted the symbol walked off without another word."
0,"""Now, don't forget about it."""
0,"""I won't,"" I responded."
0,"At the old man's call, another attendant walked over with a heavy looking sack that jingled of metal when he placed it on the center of the table."
0,"""Fifty gold coins,"" the old man said before pausing."
0,"Spinning his long beard in his fingers, he reached below the table and removes a much smaller bag."
0,"Opening the larger one, he dumped in the contents of the other."
0,"""Sixty gold coins,"" he corrected."
0,"""Please enjoy your stay."""
0,"I grabbed my bag of gold, and the knight walked me through another room and out the door."
1,I shielded my eyes from the sun as we stepped into what looked like a round garden market.
0,A large gathering of people crowded the stalls as bags of coins exchanged hands.
0,"It was then I noticed, every person visiting the stalls had a marking on their hand."
0,Only one that I saw had a blue marking like mine.
0,Others had a less extravagant red marking with the majority bearing a simple black character.
0,Red-robed men and women with die pouches at their hip rushed from stall to stall to darken the marks as the bearers received their daily allotted gold.
0,"""You will receive twenty-five gold pieces here each day when you get your mark renewed."""
0,"""How many people do you let in each day?"""
0,I asked the knight.
0,"""Today was rather small."
0,"Under the Good King's order, we can only allow a maximum of five hundred visitors at a time."
0,"Once their week is up, they must leave and another group is let in to take their place."""
0,"""How generous of the king,"" I said."
1,We walked to the stone arch which separated the exchange and the road leading to the town.
0,Horse drawn carts stood waiting with depressed looking occupants inside.
0,"""Their week is up,"" the knight informed me, noticing my stare."
0,"""A large number are leaving today, but that also means a large number will be allowed in tomorrow."""
0,"On the other side of the arch, a man sat motionless against the wall."
0,The knight also took notice and called over two guards.
0,"Unable to rouse him, they each took an arm and drug him off."
0,"""What happened?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""That was the third today."
0,Most likely the heat.
0,"When all worries of life are gone for a week, some people forget to take care of their own basic needs."""
0,"""I think I can understand that,"" I replied."
0,"""Don't be one of them."
0,"Make sure to at least drink enough water and stay in the shade if your head feels light."""
0,The knight placed his hand yet again on my shoulder.
0,"""I need to get back to watching the gate, but if I may make a suggestion of where to go first, buy yourself a new comfortable set of clothing and pay someone to give that blanket of yours a wash."""
0,I thanked the kind knight as he walked back through the arch.
1,The road before me wound into the distance around small hills and groves of trees.
0,"The land was lush and green, even in the heat of the summer sun."
0,"The beginnings of a village stood afar off, the first destination for all who were fortunate to be let inside the wall."
0,"The road was littered with people walking to and from the exchange, either with a mark on their hand or wearing red robes and being escorted by guards."
0,"As the town grew closer, it also grew bigger."
0,"What had been covered by the low hills and trees was a bustling metropolis of white stone buildings, wide streets, and lush green."
0,"Its beauty could only be described by one word, paradise."
1,"I entered the city by the large road and was soon lost to the well-cared-for shops, small shaded parks, and the occasional performers competing for tips from passing visitors."
0,Only after traveling far into the city did I remember the knight's suggestion.
0,I stopped a tired looking man without a mark on his hand.
0,"""Do you know where I could find someone to wash my clothes and this blanket?"""
0,The hunched resident took a few steps before he realized I was talking to him.
0,"""What was that?"""
0,"he asked, looking down at me."
0,I pointed to my rolled up quilt.
0,"""Where can I get this washed?"""
0,"""Oh."""
0,The man pointed back down the road.
0,"""Head the way you came about four streets."
0,To your left you will see a stream.
0,"Follow it until it widens, and there should be someone washing clothes."
0,"A few coins will get them to wash your blanket."""
0,"""My clothes too?"""
0,"The man looked at the outfit Alfred and Hazel had given me, now ragged and a little torn."
0,"""You may be better off buying something new."
0,"With that blue mark on your hand, you should be able to find a shop that will give you a generous offer."""
0,"""Thank you for the help."""
0,"Before I walked away, the man held out his hand with a small cloth in it."
0,"Noticing my confusion, he clarified."
0,"""Information doesn't come free."""
0,"""Ah…"" "
0,I opened my sack of gold and placed two gold coins on the cloth which he wrapped and placed in his pocket.
0,"""My pleasure,"" he replied and walked away."
1,"Following the man's direction, I counted four streets, and sure enough, on my left was a road with a small stream not far distant."
0,The stream widened downstream as more and more small streams flowed into it.
0,"Once it was wide enough for stone bridges to be built over it, I saw people relaxing in its grassy banks."
0,"There were not, however, people washing clothes."
0,"Thinking I had misunderstood the man's directions, I was about to walk back when a young girl no taller than me carrying a wash bucket walked out from one of the nearby buildings and sat by the side of the stream."
0,I approached and stood beside her.
0,"""Can I pay you to wash something for me?"""
0,The girl looked at me and shot to her feet.
0,"""Of--of course,"" she stuttered."
0,"""You will have to talk to my mother."
0,She handles the business.
0,"I only wash what she tells me."""
0,"""Is she in the building you walked out of?"""
0,"""Ye--yes!"""
0,I handed the girl a gold coin.
0,"""Thank you."""
0,The girl accepted the coin but placed it quickly in her lap and rubbed her hands in the stream.
1,I walked across the road to the small stone building and entered.
0,A lady carrying a small stack of clothing walked through a door in the back.
0,I sat in a chair to await her return.
0,A few minutes later the door opened again.
0,The lady startled at seeing me in a chair.
0,"""I'm sorry,"" she said with her hand to her chest."
0,"""You should have called for me."
0,"I hope you didn't wait long."""
0,I shook my head.
0,"""What can I do for you?"""
0,"""Can you wash this blanket, and also my clothes?"""
0,The lady walked over and lifted up the quilt by its corners.
0,"""Thick blankets are always difficult."
0,"This will be,"" she looked at the mark on my hand, ""three gold pieces."
0,"Your clothes will be two for a total of five."""
0,I opened my bag and removed five coins.
0,"""Can you place them on the counter?"""
0,I nodded and did as instructed.
0,The lady walked to the door carrying my blanket and called for the girl.
0,"Turning to me, she asked if I had a change of clothing."
0,"I shook my head, so she returned to the back room after handing my quilt to the girl and came back holding a long tunic."
0,"""I can't have you in my shop naked, so wear this."""
0,"I stripped, causing the girl to turn to face the door, and donned the tunic."
0,"Though the sleeves were short, they still extended to my wrists, and the tail hung just above my ankles."
0,This was intended for an adult far larger than I.
0,"With my clothes in hand, the young girl walked back outside."
0,I returned to sitting in the chair.
0,"""How many days have you been here?"""
0,the lady asked to strike a conversation.
0,"""This is my first,"" I replied."
0,"""What do you think of our country?"""
0,The woman's tone was such that I couldn't tell whether she was uninterested in my reply or already knew what my reply would be.
0,"""It's beautiful."""
0,"""Hmm?"""
0,"Again, I couldn't understand whether she was expecting me to add to what I said or surprised."
0,"""I guess I don't have much of an opinion yet,"" I replied."
0,"Feeling cornered, I held my hands in my lap and lowered my head."
0,"""You are the first I have met not to run on about how our kingdom is the best in the world, or how they never want to leave."""
0,"""I'm not sure I know what you mean,"" I replied."
0,"""Normally those who visit came because they heard about how charitable our country is,"" the lady explained."
0,"""We give money to everyone who can get in, enough for them to live comfortably for their stay."
0,"They can do almost anything they want, or at least more than most ever could in their usual lifestyle."
0,"Is that not why you came?"""
0,I shook my head.
0,"""Then how did you end up here?"""
0,"""I don't have a home."
0,I was traveling cross country when I found the wall early this morning.
0,"A man on top said paradise was inside, so I thought I'd see for myself."""
0,"""And you just happen to be let in?"
0,"Fortune favors you, child."
0,"Most try for years before they get the chance, and it makes them all the more eager to get what they can out of their stay, for better or worse."""
0,"""I guess I can understand that,"" I replied."
0,"""You should also experience the city while you can,"" the lady suggested."
0,"""It won't be long before my daughter finishes your blanket and clothes, but they will still need to dry."
0,"In that time, you should check out the bath house further down the stream."
0,"There is little point in wearing clean clothes when you are also filthy."""
0,I nodded in understanding and stood up from my chair.
0,"""Before you leave,"" the lady continued, ""we can soak your clothes in flower or spice water before drying them."
0,I can also sew up the holes.
0,"Each will cost extra, of course."""
0,"Not wanting to walk around smelling like incense, I declined the first offer but accepted the second."
0,I placed another gold coin on the counter and headed to the door.
0,"""Thank you for your business, and make sure to return that tunic or you won't be getting your blanket back,"" the lady said in a half-mocking tone on my way out."
1,"By the stream, the girl had my clothes spread out on a rock and was working on my quilt."
0,"Being far larger than her, the girl struggled to keep the wet fabric still in the flowing water as she scrubbed it with a brush."
0,I contemplated giving a tip for her effort upon my return.
1,"Not long after the stream bent to the right and the washers were out of view, I came upon a large stone structure with arching entryways."
0,Two men were carrying a rather large barrel of water from the stream inside.
0,I ran over to ask about the building.
0,"“The baths,” the man asked as he struggled with the other to carry the heavy barrel."
0,"Almost losing his grip, some water washed over the edge drenching the other man as he tried to steady himself."
0,The man shook his head to rid what water he could but was not altogether displeased with getting wet in this hot weather.
0,"When walking through the entrance, the same man’s hand almost slipped again."
0,I ran over and helped support the barrel as they walked inside.
1,"With three people, the task was simple."
0,We walked it to the left and down a hallway to a room with a furnace.
0,Above it was a small reservoir of water steaming from the heat of the furnace below.
0,"With my help, the men walked the barrel up the steps and dumped it into the reservoir."
0,"“You were a great help, and quite strong for one your age,” the clumsy man said as we set down the barrel."
0,“Someone here did not want to make two trips to refill the water.” The accused shrugged with a grunt and went down to stoke the furnace.
1,"Walking me back to the entryway, the man noticed the blue mark on my hand."
0,He fell to his knees and begged forgiveness.
0,“I am terribly sorry for making you work.
0,Please do not think wrong of our bath house.” The man grabbed my hands.
0,"“To make amends, you may enter the baths free of charge; only please do not tell anyone we made you work.”"
0,His words and change in demeanor both startled and confused me.
0,I was unsure how to respond and looked around for any help I could find.
0,The man remained bowed down holding my hand as I stood in my stupor.
0,"Not wanting to see him remain suppliant towards me, I pulled him to his feet."
0,"“I don’t see anything wrong with me helping you,” I replied."
0,The man froze.
0,“Are… are you certain?”
0,I nodded.
0,"“Consider it payment for pointing out the bath house, and I have gold enough to spend."
0,I can pay full price.”
0,“Wha… you…” The man did not know how to respond.
0,"“You are not like those who usually visit here, especially with the blue mark.”"
0,"Not wanting to draw out this uncomfortable display, I walked back to the entrance where I assumed I had to pay to use the bath."
0,The man followed and stood behind the counter.
0,“How much do I pay?” I asked holding out my bag.
0,The man hesitated as his head turned from my bag to the wooden box behind the counter and back to my bag.
0,"“Five gold pieces,” He replied, setting the box on the counter."
0,I placed my payment inside.
0,"“A few words of caution,” he said before I could walk down the hall."
0,"“There are two baths, one for women and children on the left, and one for men on the right."
0,You are at the age where you may choose between either.
0,Remove clothing before you enter the water and wrap what gold you have on you in it.
0,Keep that near you at all times.
0,It is of upmost importance you do not drop your gold in the water.
0,"In the heated pools, stay away from where the water pours in from the furnace."
0,You will get burnt.
0,Also be sure to keep your marked hand out of the water to prevent the mark from washing out.
0,Enjoy your stay.” 
1,I walked down the hall on the right until it split.
0,"On the left was the women and children’s bath, and on the right was the men’s."
0,"It did not matter to me which I used, but the loud voices and laughter of the men’s bath was off-putting, so I turned to the left."
0,"Much to my relief, the bath was not crowded."
0,Three children played under the supervision of their mother in the large center pool built into the ground.
0,"Two adults sat in an elevated bath in the back, which I assumed held the heated water."
0,A fourth woman breast-fed her infant on the side of the room.
0,I sat down at the corner of the pool and placed my foot in the water.
0,"“It’s cold,” I thought out loud."
0,"“That’s because it comes from an underground spring,” the nursing mother explained, answering my curiosity before I had time to ask."
0,“The water runs clean from the spring and out to the stream.”
0,“So it stays clean?” I asked.
0,“The underground springs are one of the reasons this city stays so green even in the heat of summer.”
0,"The more I learned about this kingdom, the more it amazed me."
0,"Not only was it beautiful, but it also had a constant supply of clean spring water."
0,I set my tunic and bag of gold beside the pool and lowered myself in.
0,"The cold caused my body to contract, but in time I acclimated and was able to relax."
0,"Over time, one of the adults from the heated bath joined the larger cold pool."
0,She had a black mark on her hand.
0,"Her bad of gold was also smaller than mine, not only by the amount of gold in it, but the bag itself would have been unable to hold the same amount."
0,"After seeing this, I noticed the other women, those without markings on their hands, did not have a bag of gold."
0,A lady came in from time to time offering food or other commodities to those in the pool.
0,"Thinking back to the washing lady, I added exceptional service to the list of reasons this was an amazing city."
0,"With my head leaned back against the edge of the pool, I let the minutes pass away."
0,"It was not until the mother of the three children told me as she was leaving that staying the water too long was not wise that I decided to get out, let myself dry, and leave the bath."
0,I thanked the man out front as he was helping carry in another large barrel of water.
0,"He nodded back, but nearly dropped the barrel again."
1,“How was it?” the lady asked in the cleaning shop as she carried my clothing in from the back where it was drying in the sun.
0,"“Wonderful,” I replied."
0,"“The more I see of this city, the more I like it.”"
0,"“Good to hear, but don’t get too attached,” she warned."
0,“Your time here is limited.
0,"Now, your clothes are more or less dry, but your blanket will need more time."
0,You can either leave it here longer or carry it with you and let the sun work on it as you see the city.”
0,"“I’ll take it with,” I replied."
0,The lady handed me my clothes and I gave her back the tunic.
0,"After changing, I headed to the door."
0,"“Be sure to not let that gold of yours go unused,” The lady said before I left the shop."
0,“It’s as valuable for enjoying your stay as it is for our wellbeing.”
0,"I thanked the lady, grateful for reminding me."
1,I walked across the road to the stream where the girl was still washing clothes.
0,"“Thank you for your hard work,” I said as I placed a gold coin on the large rock next to her."
0,"The girl startled, but nodded her head."
0,"“Please come back if you need something washed,” she replied in a shy voice."
1,I decided to follow the stream further down to see where it led.
0,"Occasional shops dotted each side, and as the stream widened further, children began to play in it."
0,"As buildings dwindled near the edge of the city, the stream opened up into a large verdant garden."
0,Irrigation lanes split the stream up as it snaked through the grass.
0,"Small stone bridges connected the grass plots between the streams, and each plot had either a tree or a stone bench to relax on."
0,A couple musicians serenaded those enjoying the garden.
0,I too found myself drawn inside the garden to a tree where I sat down.
0,One of the bards noticed my arrival and approached.
0,"“Shall I sing a song or tell a tale?” he sang, brandishing his lute."
0,"“How much for you to play the lute for me?” I asked, feeling like I was now absorbing the spirit of this paradisiacal city."
0,"“One piece for a tune, two for a song, but for ten I am yours the day long."""
0,"""Just the lute is fine,"" I said placing a coin in his outstretched bag."
0,"With the quilt in my lap and money bag at my side, I rested against the trunk of the tree as the bard played a gentle tune."
0,"The atmosphere was enjoyable, peaceful, and I wanted to bask in it as long as possible."
0,"When the bard had finished his tune, I placed three more gold pieces into his bag and told him to continue."
0,I didn't make it through the third song before I fell asleep.
1,I awoke from a light nudge.
0,The sky was darkened with only a small glow of light blue above the high wall in the distance.
0,"In a panic, I looked to my side and saw my bag of gold untouched."
0,"""Tis sweet to sleep 'neath shaded tree, for there the soul is surely free,"" spoke a voice beside me."
0,The bard sat with lute in hand beside me against the trunk of the tree.
0,"He plucked a few notes and continued, ""But what of souls do trees demand?"
0,"That timeless sleep for man to see, To trees are men changed in the end."""
0,"""Have you been here the entire time?"""
0,"I asked, getting to my feet."
0,"""I would have returned long ago,"" the bard replied, his voice no longer melodic, ""but it is unwise for one such as you to be left alone with such a large bag of gold."""
0,"""Is theft a problem, even here?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""No,"" the bard replied."
0,"""Not for us, at least."""
0,The bard pointed to the other side of the garden.
0,There stood one of the town guards.
0,He then pointed in another direction where a guard also stood.
0,I cast my eyes up the stream and noticed that there was always one guard within eyeshot of another.
0,A few were even entering the shops and homes.
0,"""So many."""
0,I responded.
0,"""Then why did you wait here and wake me?"""
0,"""If I had not woken you, a guard surely would have, but your gold is the issue."
0,Money flows like water here with no true face value and yet is of grave importance all the same.
0,"A citizen to take from another means death, but a marked hand to take gold from a marked hand is naught but an exchange."""
0,"""So you were making sure no one took my gold?”"
0,The bard got to his feet and set the lute at his back.
0,"""It makes no difference to us who pays, only that someone does, but for a blue hand to go without is a crime in my eyes.”"
0,“Then I need to thank you.
0,You said it was ten for a day?” I opened my bag and counted out six more gold coins.
0,"Happy to receive it, the man held out his bag."
0,“Have you thought of a place to stay the night?” the bard asked as he tied his coin bag at his waist.
0,"“I usually sleep outside, but if that is dangerous, could you direct me to an inn?”"
0,“Most certainly.”
1,I followed the bard back up the stream and to the main road.
0,"With the sun now set, the city was lit with small pyres along the larger streets and lanterns in the alleys."
0,Lights from the homes and shops who had not yet finished their business reflected off the white stone building.
0,The city shone like a gem in candlelight.
0,The bard led me down a small alleyway and then another to as street not lit by pyres nor lanterns.
0,"One lone house kept a light in the window, and it was to that window the bard led me."
0,"With a quick rap on the door, a lady and her husband opened."
0,"“I found you a customer,” the bard announced."
0,The lady placed her hands around the bard’s neck and kissed him on each cheek.
0,"The man, crouching to my height, grabbed me by the hand."
0,"“Welcome to the best inn in the city,” he said as he led me inside."
0,The bard waved at the couple and bowed to me.
0,"“Hold on,” I called to him before he could walk away."
0,I removed four coins and held them out.
0,“Thank you for today.”
0,"“You have already paid me well enough, but I cannot turn down the offer.”"
0,The bard untied the bag at his waist and held it out for me to drop the gold inside.
0,"With another bow, he walked off down the alley."
1,Inside was not what I expected of an inn.
0,"It had the appearance of a small, well furnished home."
0,“Is this an inn?” I asked as I looked at the decorations in the main floor.
0,“Not what you expected?” the man asked with a laugh.
0,"""Most inns can accommodate a large number of people, but that does not allow you to give as much personal attention to your guests."
0,We proposed an idea to the King to let us try an inn that feels more like a home.
0,"We can provide home cooked meals and cozy rooms for three guests."""
0,The idea was sound enough.
0,Not everyone would want to room in a crowded inn.
0,I was one of those people.
0,This suited me much better.
0,"""How much for a night?"""
0,The couple looked at each other.
0,"Turning back to me, the wife spoke up."
0,"""Fifteen for the night if you are willing to pay it."
0,"The cost does include the two meals."""
0,"""What do other inns in the city cost?"""
0,I asked out of curiosity.
0,"""Anywhere from two to five, ten at the most expensive,"" the husband replied, ""but any service beyond a bed to sleep in tends to cost extra, including food."
0,"If you wanted to, you could find somewhere cheaper."""
0,"""Our price is high because we have little choice,"" the wife explained."
0,"""We are competing incomes with the other inns, and not being able to house as many makes that difficult."""
0,"""Competing incomes?"""
0,"""There are only five hundred visitors at a time, so the beds needed are limited,"" the husband explained."
0,"""Those inns that are frequented make more money."
0,"If you do not make any money, the king sees no need for your inn."
0,"We are only still in business because we convinced the King to give this idea a chance, but there was little choice in where to set up our inn."""
0,"""That is why we are secluded in such a lonely alley,"" the wife added."
0,"""The bard who brought you sends people our way when he can, but we are hoping to get known by word of mouth."
0,It doesn't help that each inn talks down all the others.
0,"We understand if you would like to go elsewhere."""
0,"""No,"" I replied."
0,"""I prefer it here, and I can pay full price."""
0,I set my bag of gold on a side table sending the jingle of the gold ringing through the room.
0,I counted out fifteen gold coins and held them out to the couple.
0,The wife ran to another room and retuned with a cloth for me to set the money on.
0,My bag was now close to empty.
0,"""Would you like anything to eat?"""
0,the husband asked as his wife carried off the gold.
0,"""I pride myself in my cooking."""
0,"""No thank you,"" I replied."
0,"""A bed is all I need."""
0,"""Are you certain?"""
0,I nodded.
0,"""If you ever get hungry, do not be afraid to call for us."
0,"Let me show you your room."""
1,The husband retrieved a lantern and led me up the steps and to my room.
0,"It was small, but the stone walls were covered with a light-colored wood paneling."
0,In the far corner by the window sat a full sized bed of detailed workmanship.
0,The bed mat was thick and bulged with soft padding.
0,Blankets were provided on top a chest meant for belongings at the foot of the bed.
0,The room was also furnished with a padded chair and a small table holding a vase of flowers.
0,"""Better than just a bed in a crowded inn?"""
0,the husband asked.
0,"""Much better."""
0,I placed my quilt on top the pile of blankets.
0,"When I sat down on the bed, I sunk in a little."
0,"It was soft, very soft, but past the thick padding it was also firm."
0,I laid back and sprawled out.
0,"Seeing me settle in, the husband hung the lantern by the door and excused himself."
0,I centered myself on the bed.
0,Nothing I had experienced compared to this.
0,It felt like I was sleeping on a cloud.
0,"To my memory, I had never once slept in a bed, only on the ground or floor with no more than my rags or a blanket for comfort."
0,"Did everyone who owned a bed sleep like this, or was this bed special to this inn?"
0,There was no way for me to know.
0,All I knew was that this experience was well worth the fifteen gold.
0,"Soft beds, another addition to reasons I liked this city."
0,"Even after sleeping in the garden by the stream, I slept sound in the soft comfort of my bed."
1,Sun had risen by the time I woke.
0,"Thanking the couple for my stay, I promised that should anyone ask, I would refer them to their inn."
0,My first task for the day was to return to get my next day's supply of gold and have my blue mark repainted.
0,"One day had only led to light fading, so it was not beyond reason to believe that one could go an extra day without."
0,"Back at the main road, I headed out of the city to the exchange."
0,"The walk felt longer than it had been on my way to the city because I had to keep convincing myself that I was coming back, that if I didn't leave the city I would not be able to enjoy it longer."
1,"As I neared the exchange, hostility broke out as one of the guests protested being forced to leave."
0,"Two knights tried to pull him to the cart for departing guests, but he fought the entire way."
0,The familiar knight with the blue cape was called in.
0,"In the struggle with the two knights, the knight in charge grabbed the man by the wrist and broke his arm removing his will to fight."
0,The man cried out as the two knights bound him and tossed him in the back of the cart.
0,The knight in charge noticed me watching and came to greet me.
0,"""Sorry you had to see that,"" he apologized."
0,"""I hope it doesn't change your opinion of our country."
0,"You see, we give these people money, let them live in luxury, and then when we say it is over, some have the audacity to tell us they deserve to stay longer and fight when we refuse."
0,"Do you understand?"""
0,I nodded.
1,"""How was your first day?"""
0,the knight asked as he walked me through the stone arch.
0,"The small garden market was not as crowded as it had been the day before, but being morning was the likely reason."
0,"""Hard to describe,"" I replied to the knight's question."
0,"""It must have been a little overwhelming, but fret not, you still have six days to get used to it."""
0,We walked to a table where a younger man in red robes asked for my money bag.
0,"""You spent a lot,"" the knight remarked."
0,"""Some due to carelessness,"" I replied, thinking back to sleeping in the garden."
0,"""What you lost due to carelessness is the price of the knowledge gained from it."
0,The gold did not go to waste.
0,"But do be more frugal,"" the knight advised."
0,"""From here on out you will receive half what you received the first day."
0,We give a greater sum at first because we understand people will not know how to manage it in an unknown market.
0,"Learn from your spending yesterday and be better about it today."""
0,"""Twenty and five gold pieces for today,"" the man in the robe said, handing me back the bag."
0,"""Hand."""
0,"I held out my hand, and the a robed man beside the money exchanger rubbed off my blue mark with abrasive leather and repainted it, but this time with two lines crossing the tail at the loop."
0,"""Is that how you record how long people have stayed, the extra lines?"""
0,I asked the night.
0,"""It is to mark how many times you have received your money,"" The knight replied."
0,"""But because you come to receive money once per day, you are not wrong in saying it marks the days."""
0,"""What would keep someone from erasing a line like he did before repainting it?"""
0,I inquired.
0,"""Did you see the mark disappear when the dye was rubbed off?"""
0,"Thinking back, there was still a shadow of the mark on my skin."
0,I shook my head.
0,"""No."""
0,"""The dye stains the skin for days after removal."
0,"Should someone try, we would notice and brand him a criminal."
0,"It has happened many times before."""
0,"""I see."""
0,The knight walked me back through the stone arch as the garden market began to bustle with the morning's arrivals.
0,"He waved me off, and I began the trek back up the road to the city."
1,"The majority of my first day was spent along the stream on the right side of the city, so I decided to see what was on the left."
0,"Aside from the dark alley with the inn, the left was all new."
0,I located the widest street turning left.
0,"Instead of indoor shops, the street was lined on each side by food vendors selling their produce to eager villagers and visitors alike."
0,"I continued down the road past vegetables, meat, and other forms of fresh and prepared edibles."
0,"Some stalls even cooked food fresh for the customers, and these were the most popular."
0,I paused a moment to watch one man wielding a large knife and a flat metal plate with a handle.
0,"Holding it above a blazing fire, he stabbed a green vegetable of some sort and proceeded to chop it on the plate he held over the fire."
0,"He continued with a variety of vegetables, tossing them occasionally as he cooked them over the flame."
0,"Once finished, he held up his masterpiece."
0,"The smell alone was enough to make me buy it, but that would serve no purpose other than letting the food go to waste."
0,"Even if I had been able to eat it, I would not have had a chance."
0,The crowd forced me back away from the stall as they held out their payment.
0,Only three were able to secure the dish as their morning meal.
0,"The others were left to wait for his next masterpiece, which he announced with its ingredients as soon as his plate was cleared."
1,"Not far down the road, another stall caught my eye."
0,Lined up on a red blanket atop a stall were large red apples.
0,"The stall was run by two women, one behind it and one with a small basket walking apples to the busy shoppers on the road."
0,I walked up to the woman with the basket.
0,"""How much for one?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""One coin for three,"" she replied."
0,I fished out a coin from my bag and placed it in her gloved hand.
0,"After placing the gold in her coin pouch, she supported the basket with her gloved hand and skillfully grabbed me three apples with her bare hand."
0,"At the same time, a passerby stopped next to her and grabbed an apple."
0,The mark on his hand was as red as the apple in it.
0,"He took a bite, but spat it out."
0,"""Disgusting,"" he said, tossing the apple at the basket."
0,"The basket, only sitting atop the woman's gloved hand, fell to the ground spilling its contents all over the street."
0,"All around, both shoppers and merchants took notice, but not one spoke against the man nor raised a finger to help."
0,"""Stop,"" I called at the man as he walked away."
0,The man looked over his shoulder at me and turned around.
0,"""What do you want, boy?"""
0,"Unsure why I called out, I kept silent."
0,I didn't know what to say.
0,The man approached me as I stood in silence and looked down at me waiting for an answer.
0,"""You shouldn't have done that,"" I managed to say."
0,The man leaned down into my face to which I looked away.
0,"""I was only saving others from buying her foul tasting apples."""
0,"With that remark, he turned and walked away."
0,I brought the apple in my hand to my nose and smelled it.
0,It didn't smell foul or rotten.
0,"It smelled as good, if not better than any other apple I had smelled in the past."
0,I gripped the apple and tossed it at the man.
0,The impact on the back of his head burst the apple in a spray of white.
0,The man fell to the street unconscious and me to my knees as I tried to suppress the aching throb in the back of my head.
0,I turned back to the lady still on the street looking at the basket in front of her.
0,"""How many apples were in the basket?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Seven or eight, I think,"" she replied."
0,"""I'll buy them all,"" I said, holding out my bag of gold."
0,"""Why?"
0,"Why would you do that?"""
0,the lady asked in disbelief.
0,"Without answering, I placed three coins in her basket, grabbed an apple from the road beside her, and walked away."
1,"Further down, the street opened into a clearing with grass and trees."
0,I sat under a tree and easily split the apple in two with my fingers.
0,"Holding it up to my nose, I took in the subtle but pleasant aroma."
0,"Placing the apple to my mouth, I tried opening my mouth to take a bite, but the more I tried, the more trepidation overcame me."
0,My hand shook till I could no longer hold the apple.
0,I gave up once it fell to my lap.
0,I could not eat it.
0,"Nothing changed, just like nothing ever had."
1,"Leaving the apple at the base of the tree, I walked across the grass field to a small fenced-in section surrounded by cheering spectators."
0,"Swimming through the crowd to the fence, I saw the source of the excitement."
0,Two men did battle.
0,"One was a knight of the city dressed in full armor not unlike the knight at the gate, only his cape was red and he wore a helmet."
0,His opponent was a black-marked visitor dressed in light training gear.
0,"They dueled with real weaponry despite the danger that it presented, although the man with the black mark did not seem unskilled with his sword."
0,The two appeared even as attack was met with parry.
0,A man collapsed over the fence across from the duel causing a commotion among the spectators.
0,"The knight ended the dual by deflecting the man's sword, kneeing him in the stomach, and forcing him to the ground, having only toyed with him during the course of the duel."
0,"With his hand in the air, he called for two guards."
0,"Pointing at the man hanging over the fence, the guards rushed over and pulled him off."
0,"The man's skin was pale, lifeless, and on his wrist was a red mark."
0,"With the lifeless body removed, the spectators near where the man had fallen were restless, but the knight paid it no mind as he called out to the crowd."
0,"""Do I have another challenger?"
0,"Ten gold for a fight, and should you perform well, you have a chance at joining our forces, becoming a resident of the kingdom."""
0,"Almost as if all had forgotten the man who fell dead on the fence, the crowd roared with excitement once more."
0,"Spectators waived their arms and bags of gold to draw the attention of the knight who walked along the fence, surveying the crowd."
0,He circled the entire fence and returned to the center.
0,"Turning to me, he called out, ""Boy with the blue mark, enter the ring."""
0,"I looked around, but no one entered the ring."
0,There was no other boy with a blue mark on his hand but me.
0,I hopped the fence and entered the arena.
0,"So long as there was no physical harm involved, I saw no reason not to try a duel."
0,My entrance was met with disproval by the majority of spectators.
0,"“Have you any skill with the sword, boy?” the knight asked."
0,I shook my head.
0,“One can learn.”
0,A man walked over with a wooden box for me to deposit my ten gold coins.
0,"At the knight’s prompt, I placed my blanket on the grass with my bag of gold underneath."
0,Another knight placed a leather training vest over me and tied it at the waist.
0,"It was a little too big, but not enough to restrict my movement."
0,“Can you hold a sword at the very least?” the knight joked as he handed me a sword by its blade.
0,I grabbed the handle and held it up.
0,"“You have a good grip,” the knight complimented."
0,“The sword looks weightless in your hands.
0,There may be hope for you yet.”
0,The knight took a few steps back from me and I did the same.
0,I was beginning to become self-conscious with all the spectators around me.
0,"I did not like being the center of attention, and here I was, the spectacle."
0,“This is just a duel?” I asked.
0,“No injury?”
0,"“I cannot say for certain there will be none,” The knight replied."
0,"“These are not training swords, but I will not fight to harm you."
0,I merely wish to test your potential.
0,It is rare to have a child enter our walls.
0,Children learn better than adults who have settled into their own habits whether helpful or detrimental.” The knight raised his sword.
0,“Let us begin.
0,You may strike first.”
0,"“I do not want to become a knight,” I informed him."
0,“We shall see.”
0,The knight's sword was held in front.
0,"I wanted to avoid hitting him if at all possible, so I ran at him and swung at the side of his sword, making sure not to hit too hard."
0,"“Good hit,” the knight complimented."
0,He returned his sword to the front to await another strike.
0,"I hit the sword again, but this time the knight swung back."
0,"My sword took the hit, but I fell to my back causing an explosion of laughter from the crowd."
0,"“Watch your posture,” the knight warned."
0,"“If this was a battle and you fell to the ground, you would be dead.”"
0,The knight stepped back to let me stand.
0,"I swung at the sword again, and as expected, the knight swung back."
0,"My sword took the blow, but I this time I held it steady, too steady by accident."
0,My sword did not move.
0,The knight relaxed his sword.
0,"“You may be better than you let on,” he said."
0,“Are you sure you have not experience?”
0,"“None,” I repeated truthfully."
0,"The knight now took the advance with the sword in one hand and swung at me, but it was slow enough for me to step out of the way."
0,"The next swing came in faster, but I avoided it as well."
0,It was only when he stepped in to a distance I had to block that I put my sword up.
0,The parry was awkward and almost caught me off balance again.
0,My struggle was met with more laughs from the crowd.
0,"""You are holding back,"" the knight accused."
0,"""What are you afraid of?"""
0,I kept silent and took yet another step back.
0,"""If you are afraid of hurting me,"" the knight swung up, ""you need not worry."
0,"I don’t think you could."""
0,I continued baking up until I reached the fence.
0,The crowd behind me fell back as the next swing from the knight hit the wooden post as I dodged.
0,I ran back to the center of the arena to keep from involving the crowd.
0,The knight followed at even pace and thrust his sword into an opening beneath my arm.
0,"""Were this a battle, you would be dead yet again."""
0,"Not giving me time to react, the knight whipped my side with the blunt end of the sword."
0,It stung.
0,I staggered back and held my blade up to prevent a repeat.
0,"""Were this a real battle and your life were in danger, or a future loved one, or anyone you wished to protect,"" the knight continued his onslaught as he spoke, with me dodging and avoiding him wherever possible, ""a half-assed attitude like yours will get everyone killed."
0,You cannot fear battle.
0,"I see you have strength yet you refuse to show it."""
0,The knight stepped in and kneed me in the chest the same as he had done the former challenger.
0,"I fell to my butt, and the knight pointed his sword at my neck."
0,"With this I thought the duel was over, but the knight continued speaking."
0,"""If a loved one was behind you, would you dodge my attack?"""
0,He lifted his sword and thrust it at me.
0,"I rolled to the side, but the jingle of change met my ears."
0,Hazel's quilt had been behind me.
0,The knight's sword stuck through it and into the bag of gold underneath.
0,My grip tightened on my sword and I swung with all my might.
0,The blade broke clean through the knight's sword and cut into the plate armor at his stomach.
0,A light crimson spray followed the arch of my sword from the blood on the tip.
0,"The knight stepped back, and the audience fell silent in shock."
0,"A cold pain ran along my stomach, and when I felt it, I realized I was also bleeding."
0,"I tore off the leather training armor, grabbed the quilt, and ran to the fence."
0,"As I forced my way through the crowd, they questioned among themselves whether the knight had in fact injured me."
1,"Not looking back and not knowing if anyone was pursuing me, I ran."
0,The pain in my stomach was unbearable.
0,"I tried to cover it, but the red stain continued to grow, drawing the looks of anyone I passed."
0,I soon found a side street with few people and ran down to a secluded alley.
0,"Once sitting down, I pulled up my blood soaked shirt to see the damage I inflicted upon the knight."
0,"Gritting my teeth, I opened the several-inch-long gash in my stomach to check its depth."
0,"To my relief, it was not too deep, and should the knight receive treatment, he would survive."
0,"With the wellbeing of the night off my mind, I sat against the white stone wall and tried to ignore the stinging pain."
0,"The bleeding was slowing now, but the damage had already run its course on my clothing."
0,My lower shirt and much of my pants were wet with blood.
0,"""You, boy!"""
0,A guard called from the street.
0,"I turned my back to him to try and hide my injury, but I was sure he noticed."
0,"""Why are you hiding?"
0,"Show me your hand,"" he ordered."
0,"I raised my left hand, stained with blood from my stomach, to show the guard."
0,"The blue mark was un-faded, still fresh from being repainted no more than an hour ago."
0,With this the guard seemed pleased.
0,"""Then there is no trouble,"" he responded."
0,"""If you are injured, you had best find a doctor."
0,"I do not want you dying on the streets and disrupting the other visitors or in a hole where no one will find you."""
0,"After voicing that base concern, the guard walked back down the main street."
0,I sat back against the white stone to rest.
0,"Any movement was met with searing pain, and if I wanted to go back out into the city, my body needed to heal enough for the pain to not be a problem."
0,"With my eyes closed, I rested in that alleyway for a few hours."
1,"Once the bleeding had stopped and the pain had become more of an annoyance than a hindrance, I stood up and walked back into the street."
0,Every head I passed followed me and yet no one dared ask what happened or if I was alright.
0,"The occasional guard stopped me, but only to tell me to find a doctor so I wouldn’t die on the streets."
0,Their reasons for concern ranged from troubling or distracting the visitors to even me dirtying their beautiful city.
0,Each time they made sure the mark on my hand was not faded.
0,"When I asked for the closest place to get my blanket sewn or my clothes washed, no one paid my question any thought without gold recompense, so I had little choice but to return across the city to the cleaners I had visited the day before."
1,I made my way to the main road and crossed it to find the stream.
0,Further down I found the young girl where she had been the day before washing another pile of clothes.
0,She covered her mouth to hold in a scream when she saw me and ran inside to grab her mother.
0,"They both ran back outside, but the lady stopped before reaching the stream."
0,“What happened?” she asked.
0,"“It was nothing,” I replied."
0,“I’ll be okay.
0,I was only wondering if you could sew my quilt.”
0,“What about your clothes?” she asked.
0,“Should you really be worrying about his clothes?” the girl asked.
0,“He’s hurt!”
0,"“If he says he will be okay, there is nothing we can do about it,” her mother advised."
0,Turning back to me she continued.
0,"“We can wash your clothes as well,” but then noticed I did not have my gold."
0,“Do you have payment?”
0,“That is why I only asked for my blanket.
0,"If possible, I want to work for this favor.”"
0,"“No, that will not do,” she replied."
0,“We cannot have you working for us.
0,"What would that do for our business if people realized they did not have to pay for our service, or if the King found out that we made a visitor work for us?”"
0,"“But mother,” the girl protested."
0,"“No, and get back to work."
0,People will be expecting their clothes washed when they return.”
0,The girl walked back to her rock and knelt down without another word.
0,"“Sorry child,” the lady said to me, “but we cannot afford to work unless we are paid."
0,Our livelihood is at stake.” She walked back to her shop but stopped at the door.
0,“What do you think of our country?” she asked before walking back inside.
1,"“Come over here,” the girls said looking back at me from the river."
0,I walked over and sat down next to her.
0,"“Please… Please forgive my mother,” she pleaded."
0,“She wants to help.
0,She really does… but she can’t.
0,We were almost shut down because we weren’t productive enough.
0,We weren’t earning more than other cleaners in the town.
0,"It took us a long time and a lot of work to become competitive, and… and my mother doesn’t want to risk losing that.”"
0,“I understand.
0,"Thank you.” I stood up and was about to walk off, but the girl tugged on my pant leg."
0,"“You… Well, you did pay me extra yesterday, so… if you want, I can at least show you the best way to wash the blood out.”"
0,"“Thank you, but I will have to take my clothes off,” I warned thinking back to when I stripped in the shop."
0,"“That… that’s fine,” the girl managed to say."
0,“I have seen it before…”
0,"After setting down my quilt, I moved a little downstream to where the next larger rock laid beside the streambed and pushed it into the stream to match how the girl’s was located."
0,She watched in amazement at how easily I moved the heavy stone.
0,I then removed my shirt and pants.
0,"The girl gasped at the sight of the cut on my stomach, but I reassured her that I would be fine."
0,"Her hands now shaking, she showed me how to rinse and scrub my shirt to wash the blood out, how beating the fabric with soft wood loosened the stains."
0,"Due to how long I rested in the alley, much of the blood had set in and could not be removed."
0,"Back at the shop, I noticed the girl’s mother watching, but she did not seem to have a problem with the girl teaching me so long as she continued washing her own laundry."
0,"Once I had done the best I could, I spread my pants and shirt on the grass to dry and proceeded to wipe what blood I could off of me."
0,"Once finished, I laid back beside my clothes."
0,"The girl continued washing, returned the finished load, and came back out with another."
0,Never once did she take a break.
0,"Her hands were red and raw, trembling each time she gripped the fabric."
0,“Do you ever rest?” I asked.
0,“No…” the girl replied.
0,“I can’t.”
0,I was beginning to pity the girl.
0,She sweated over other’s clothes as those who were given money for visiting were able to live in luxury.
0,"Had I gold, I would have given her more just from seeing how hard she worked, but I knew that if I did, it would only go to her mother."
0,"Once my clothes were dry enough, I dressed and thanked the girl for her help."
0,"“Please don’t think wrong of us,” she said, “And please come back if you need anything.”"
0,“And if I have money?” I added.
0,The girl’s hands fell to her lap and her head sunk down.
0,"“I don’t think wrong of you,” I clarified."
0,“But I do think I am starting to understand.”
1,I grabbed my blanket and walked back up the stream to the main road.
0,The radiant white of the city was beginning to dull.
0,"With much of the blood washed from my clothes, fewer people took notice of me, and now with no money to spend, I felt no different than when I visited any other city I stumbled upon on my journeys."
0,"Even though in truth I had not lost anything, it still left me saddened due to what I had been able to experience the day before."
0,"I felt like I was not living up to the potential possible in a kingdom deemed the most charitable of all, but I had my own carelessness to blame."
0,At least all I had to do was wait till the next day to get another twenty five gold.
1,I spent the remainder of the day further down the main road where a large square was located.
0,"Street performers competed for attention and tips as they juggled, blew fire, or displayed complicated acrobatics."
0,"Whether or not a spectator gave gold was up to their generosity, so someone like me without payment was still able to enjoy the spectacle."
0,"As evening came, the performers dwindled."
0,It was time for me to look for somewhere to sleep the night.
1,I continued left from the square to locate one of the cities many gardens.
0,"Finding one both small and secluded, I sat beneath a tree and closed my eyes."
0,Not two minutes had passed before a guard kicked my feet.
0,"""No sleeping in gardens is permitted."""
0,He then noticed I had no bag of gold.
0,"""Show your hand."""
0,I stood up and held my left hand out to the guard.
0,"The mark looked worn from washing my clothes in the stream, something I had failed to notice or prevent."
0,"""How long have has it been since you have been back to the exchange?"""
0,The guard asked.
0,"""This morning,"" I replied."
0,"""I had stained my clothes and tried washing them off in the stream."
0,"I forgot to protect it."""
0,"The guard inspected the mark, rubbing it with his finger."
0,"""It does look more washed out than worn."
0,"Make sure to return early tomorrow or another guard not as kind as I will detain you."""
0,I thanked the guard as he walked away.
0,"Now with no money for an inn or ability to rest in a garden, I had no idea where to go."
0,"The sun was setting just below the wall in the distance, and not long after night would be here."
0,My only choice was to stay awake all night and sleep in the morning when I had money.
1,"Leaving the garden, I headed up the road following another stream."
0,"In the distance, two men stood in front of a young adult girl."
0,"As I neared, I noticed the girl was not happy with their accompaniment."
0,"She tried to walk away, but one of them grabbed her wrist, trying to convince her not to leave."
0,"""It's a fair offer,"" I heard one of the men say as I approached."
0,"""It's well worth two day's pay."""
0,"""No,"" the girl refused."
0,"The scene was unsettling, but the guards in the area did not seem to care."
0,"""You are that butcher's daughter, correct?"""
0,the man asked.
0,"""What of it?"""
0,the girl replied.
0,"""I'm sure your father could use the gold to save him from being shut down and sent to the mines."""
0,"The girl's head sank, but she still shook her head."
0,"""How about this,"" the other man spoke up."
0,"""Spend the night with us and instead of paying twenty, we will each pay twenty."""
0,It was then that I noticed both their hands bore blue marks but different from mine.
0,There was no tail with lines counting the days crossing it.
0,"Instead, the tail curved back up to the hook."
0,At their waist were two coin bags as big as mine had been.
0,The man who proposed the offer held out his hand.
0,The girl hesitated but placed her hand in his.
0,I could not fight the uneasy feeling it caused me.
0,"Unsure what possessed me, I walked over to the group."
0,"""Let her go,"" I told them, though my voice was not aggressive."
0,"The two men looked at me, and the girl, realizing what she was about to agree to do, withdrew her hand."
0,This did not sit well with the two men.
0,"""Get lost,"" the first man ordered."
0,"""You have no place here."""
0,"""Not until you leave her alone,"" I said."
0,"""We are not forcing her to do anything,"" the second replied."
0,"""You must be new to the city or you'd understand."
0,These people need the gold we are given at the gate.
0,"I was only providing her an option to earn a lot of it all at once."""
0,"""No,"" the girl spoke up."
0,"""I won't do it!"""
0,"""Think of your family,"" the first said."
0,"""You are hurting and this gold will convince the king that your shop is productive."""
0,"""Away from her, pigs, before I gut you!"""
0,called a large man as he ran down the road with a large knife.
0,The two men cowered and fled.
0,A nearby guard who had done nothing but sit back to watch the event unfold laughed.
0,This town was beginning to disgust me.
0,"""What were you thinking!"""
0,her father yelled.
0,"""I wasn't going to go with them,"" the girl tried to assure him."
0,"""She almost did!"""
0,"the guard called back, ""For only forty!"""
0,The girl glared at the guard only causing him to laugh again.
0,"""Go home,"" he ordered."
0,"Noticing me and the blue mark on my hand, he pointed his knife at me."
0,"""You had better leave too, boy, before I sell fresh cuts of you tomorrow morning."""
0,"""No, papa,"" the girl jumped in."
0,"""He was trying to help me."""
0,"Hearing this from his daughter, the butcher lowered his knife."
0,He turned around to compose himself then faced me again.
0,"""Boy,"" he said in a harsh tone, ""I see you have no purse."
0,"Have you any gold?"""
0,"""No,"" I replied."
0,"""Then you may stay with us for the night as thanks for helping my daughter."""
1,The butcher and his daughter led me upstream until the stream disappeared underground.
0,Off a side street to the right was a small shop sandwiched between two houses.
0,A guard waited for us at the door.
0,"“You are supposed to be here when I arrive,” the guard said as the butcher approached."
0,"“I was held up,” the butcher replied, not happy to see the guard."
0,“Were you able to make any profit today?”
0,"Ignoring the guard, the butcher opened the door to his shop and let us in."
0,"The guard was about to enter as well, but the butcher pointed his knife at the guard’s chest."
0,“You wait outside.”
0,"“No need for hostility,” the guard protested although undaunted by the butcher’s aggression."
0,The butcher walked to the back of the shop and retrieved a wooden box I had seen in most of the other shops.
0,"He shoved it in the guard’s hands and was about to close the door, but the guard blocked it with his foot."
0,"“This looks no different than what you received this morning,” the guard said."
0,"“That’s because it is no different,” the butcher replied, stabbing his knife into the doorframe."
0,The guard tossed the box into the shop showering coins throughout the room.
0,"“Then keep it,” he said."
0,“I’ll just skip you on my morning rounds.
0,You have been on the watch list for some time now.
0,"If you don’t make any money, the king will replace you with someone who will.”"
0,With those parting words the guard left.
1,"I bent down to pick up the money, but the butcher stopped me."
0,“Don’t touch it with your bare hands.
0,"You’ll get sick,” he warned."
0,“Sick?” I repeated.
0,"It was then I realized that in every exchange or payment I made, no one touched a coin except the washing girl who cleaned her hands immediately afterwards."
0,"There was always a bag, box, rag, or glove."
0,The only people who touched the money were the visitors.
0,“Why would people use money that’s poisonous?”
0,The butcher sat down on a stool by the window.
0,“The gold here is the biggest farce ever developed by this country.
0,It has no worth.
0,Both visitors and citizens alike are given it every morning and whatever was earned throughout the day is collected so it can be redistributed again.”
0,"“Then what purpose does the money serve,” I asked?"
0,“Why does everyone say they need it?”
0,"“You need it if you want to keep living as you are,” The butcher’s daughter answered."
0,“The king uses it to see who is the most productive.
0,"If you don’t earn any money, or earn less than another with the same trade, the king assigns you somewhere else.”"
0,"“And if you fail in multiple professions,” the butcher continued, “you are seen as refuse and sent to labor in the mines near the eastern wall."
0,The guards are taskmasters and the citizens slaves to the king.
0,We are all pitted against each other in an economic arena for the king’s pleasure and pocket.”
0,“And it seems your shop has been failing.” 
0,I set my quilt down and began picking up the coins.
0,“Did you not listen?” the butcher reprimanded.
0,"“I won’t get sick,” I replied."
0,“I can’t.”
0,“May.” 
0,"At the butcher’s call, his daughter grabbed a rag and began picking up the coins with me."
0,The butcher rubbed his temples with his thumb and forefinger.
0,"“If I don’t think of some way to increase sales, we will be shut down.”"
0,"“What happens then?” I asked, placing the last few coins in the box."
0,"“My father has changed professions many times before he became a butcher,” May replied."
0,“This is the first one that has done well for us.”
0,“What happened?” 
0,"“It was not any single event,” the butcher replied."
0,"“We may have been new and not well known, but were making enough from visitors to stay in the market."
0,The problem was that we could not compete against the other butchers in town.
0,"Receiving less gold, we were not able to secure the best cuts of meat."
0,"Word got out that our quality was lower, and we have not been able to recover.”"
0,"“Summers make it even harder for butchers,” May added."
0,"“With it so hot, the meat spoils faster."
0,Most kills need to be sold that day.
0,"We have no salt in our kingdom to preserve it, and you can only dry so much meat."
0,"Eventually a lot goes unsold, or in our case, none of it."
0,"If we could survive the summer, we should be able to make money in winter when meat lasts longer.”"
0,"“Until next summer when we will be shut down for certain,” the butcher confessed."
0,"“If you had something to help meat last longer, you would do better?” I asked."
0,"“If we had a way to keep the meat from spoiling, the farmers would choose us over the other butchers because less of their livestock would be wasted.”"
0,"“I know of a way,” I said."
0,“But only if water freezes here in winter.”
0,"“It does,” the butcher replied, “but if you are talking about ice, it melts by summer even when indoors."
0,Other butchers have tried it.”
0,"“The water from the underground streams here is cold, even in summer, so the ground temperature should be low as well,” I explained."
0,"“I still don’t think the ice would last,” the butcher said, but May cut him off."
0,"“Stop being so pessimistic, and let him speak.” May reprimanded."
0,"With the butcher silenced, I continued."
0,“I’ve wanted to find someone to give this to.
0,An old man that let me stay at his home in the winter discovered a way to make ice last all year.
0,"He died two winters ago, and I don’t think he told anyone about it.”"
0,"“If you have such a method,” the butcher interrupted, “I could convince the king to let me stay until winter.” "
0,The butcher’s voice no longer reeked of pessimism.
0,I explained Alfred’s frozen hay blocks to the butcher.
0,The stream near their shop would supply the water.
0,Hay could be acquired from any field.
0,"The coin boxes they had were similar in size to the wooden molds Alfred had used, only they would have to secure one that had not come in contact with the tainted gold or build their own."
0,All that remained was the cellar.
0,The butcher explained that the king would order the construction if they pleaded the idea to him and the advantages it would bring.
0,"“We will request an audience with the king tomorrow,” the butcher said, now brimming with excitement."
0,"“If this goes well, we may finally have a competitive advantage against the other butchers.” He then walked over and placed his hands on my shoulders."
0,“You may have saved us.
0,How can I repay you?”
0,"“Save payment until after we find out if the king will let you,” I suggested."
0,“Then we shall.
0,I need to be at the castle first thing in the morning.
0,Will you accompany me?” the butcher asked.
0,“I will.” I replied.
1,At daybreak I left with the butcher to go to the castle.
0,"Around us, merchants were setting up shop, and very few visitors were on the streets."
0,I felt a lot more comfortable without the large crowds and commotion.
0,"In the tranquility, I had to remind myself that this city, even with its many flaws, had its own type of beauty."
0,"Up the main road, far past the square a large courtyard and gate led to the castle."
0,The white stone structure was more wide than tall.
0,The upper floors were only just above the height of the homes.
0,Stone arches and circled windows lined the walls with various plants and greenery not just on the premises but growing on the castle itself.
0,It was not like any castle I had ever seen.
0,At the gate a row of guards lined up to keep back a gathering of people who also requested entry into the castle.
0,We took our place in the crowd to await the time the gates would open.
0,It was not long before I understood why the butcher wanted to arrive early.
0,"Just like when I waited outside the wall, more people gathered at the gate over time."
0,"When the gates behind the row of guards opened, we were near the front of the group by comparison."
0,The guards were joined by a large force of a couple dozen knights.
0,"These knights surrounded the front group, the butcher and I included, and escorted us through the gate."
0,The gate closed behind us and the remaining people were forced to wait.
1,The knights led us through large doors into a rather expansive hall with polished silver mirrors lining breadth of each side.
0,"When looking at them, the hall seemed to expand indefinitely."
0,It was rather unsettling.
1,"Once through the hall, we were gathered in a large room to await our turn at audience with the king."
0,It seemed that the order we had arrived did not play into who got first audience.
0,A knight called out for those who had marks on their hands.
0,"I, as well as five others were pulled out from the crowd."
0,One man with a blue mark the same as the two who were accosting the butcher's daughter was selected to be first.
0,His audience was short lasted.
0,Not five minutes later he was pulled out by two guards as he screaming in protest.
0,"Being the only other with a blue marking, I was selected to go next, but only after scrutiny due to how warn my mark became and the confiscation of my quilt."
0,"I informed the guard that the butcher was with me, and he was permitted to join."
1,We walked through the doors to a white marble hall with a single elevated throne.
0,On it sat a king in a gold armor.
0,"I had expected an old king to be running this advanced of a kingdom, but by appearance, he was rather young."
0,We stopped at the steps to the throne and were instructed to bow.
0,"""Rise,"" the king ordered."
0,"""What proposition will you intrigue me with this morning?"""
0,"""Your majesty,"" the butcher began, ""I am one of the butchers of your generous kingdom."""
0,"The king held up his hand, and the butcher fell silent."
0,"After about a minute, a scribe appeared holding a piece of parchment."
0,"""Merek, son of Borin."
0,"Currently employed as one of six butchers of your highness's kingdom,"" the young scribe read in a nasally voice."
0,"""He is ranked lowest in yield of gold, pending termination."""
0,"""Here to plea your case as a failure?"""
0,the king asked.
0,"""Yes my lord, and propose for your blessing an idea to increase productivity."""
0,The strong butcher that once held a knife against a guard was now shaking as he spoke.
0,"""And did you bring this privileged guest along to gain first access to an audience with me?"""
0,I was unsure what the repercussions of such a play of the system would be.
0,The butcher looked at me and then at the king.
0,"""N--no, your highness,"" the butcher stuttered."
0,"""The proposition was brought to my attention by this boy, and we bring it to you now."""
0,The king tapped his fingers on the marble arm of his throne.
0,"""Were this idea yours, I would have commended your intelligence in using the boy in that manner, but seeing that you were planning on taking advantage of an idea brought to you by a child, I now understand why you have failed in your given profession."
0,"Remove this disgrace from my court."""
0,"At the king's command, two knights grabbed the butcher by the arms and drug him back out the hall."
0,"He pleaded mercy from the king, but it fell on deaf ears."
0,"I was going to follow them out, but the king ordered me to stay."
0,"""What knowledge do you possess, child, which would be of use an incompetent butcher."""
0,I spent a moment to gather my thoughts.
0,"The true nature of the king remained uncertain, and I did not want Alfred's genius to fall to one who would not appreciate it as the butcher would."
0,"""I will explain on one condition, my lord,"" I spoke up, though quiet."
0,"""You are bold, asking something of a king before the value of your knowledge can be assessed,"" the king said, ""but that itself deserves some admiration."
0,"What is your condition?"""
0,"""That the butcher you sent away be the first to implement it should my proposal please you,"" I replied."
0,"""Your manner of speech is far more educated than a child of your age should possess,"" the king complimented."
0,"""Great minds hold the only true value in this world."
0,I will consider your condition.
0,"What is your proposal?"""
0,I first explained to the king what the butcher had told me about the problems preparing meat in the summer.
0,"With that concern brought to the King's attention, I felt confident that he would understand the value of what Alfred had discovered."
0,"The king listened intently as I explained the step-by-step process of creating the bricks of frozen hay and the benefit of storing them underground, especially in this country where the underground springs keep the ground cool."
0,"After hearing the proposal, the king called his scribe."
0,"""I want preparations made for implementation in all butcheries within the kingdom by winter,"" the king commanded."
0,"""What of my condition?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Should the butcher manage to keep his business until winter, he too will be able to reap the benefit of this new technology, but you must understand."
0,"The value of a proposal like this is not something that should be confined to the least of our butchers."""
0,"It was hard to disagree with the king's logic, but in a sense, I felt like I had let the butcher and his daughter down."
0,"With this, their position would not change."
0,"""What is to happen to the butcher and his daughter if their business is unsuccessful?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Call my chief advisor,"" the king ordered, ignoring my question."
0,"Almost as if he had been waiting to be summoned, an elderly man walked in from a door on the side of the hall."
0,"""You are to listen to the people."
0,"I take my leave here."""
0,"At the king's command, the elderly man stood four steps below the throne and faced the door as the king stood up."
0,"""Come,"" the king ordered me."
1,I followed the king out the same door the advisor had entered as woman with a red marking on her hand walked in through the large doors.
0,The scribe and one of the king's personal guards followed us out the hall and up a few flights of stairs.
0,"Through a decorated passageway, the king led me to a balcony that overlooked the kingdom."
0,The balcony stood just above the building surrounding the large courtyard allowing us to see most of the city.
0,The wall towered in the distance glowing orange in the morning sun.
0,It was not until I could see the kingdom in its entirety that I realized.
0,The wall was not constructed as a means of keeping people out of the city.
0,"It was a cage, to keep the citizens in."
0,"""What do you think of my kingdom?"""
0,the king asked.
0,"""The citizens live at the mercy of selfish visitors as they compete for toxic gold in order to preserve of their way of life,"" I replied."
0,"The scribe's quill quivered as he wrote my statement, and the king's guard was about to draw his sword, but the king raised his hand to put the knight at ease."
0,"""I could not have described it better,"" the king replied, ""And it is an example of true genius."""
0,The king beckoned I stand beside him by the banister.
0,"Below, the crowd in front of the gate had grown an hundred fold."
0,"People crowded in to get audience with the king, but he was here on the balcony neglecting his people."
0,“One hundred years ago this kingdom was a cesspool of greed.
0,People stole and killed each other for land and money.
0,The most fertile springs were coveted by lords who would sell water at prices too high for the poor to pay.
0,"Those destitute would cry out to the king, my great grandfather, for peace and reason."
0,He gathered his wisest men to find an answer.
0,"After years of deliberation, one cause stood above the rest.”"
0,The king held up a small gold coin and placed it in my hand.
0,“Money?” I asked.
0,"“The problem was not money in itself,” the king replied, “but our desire for something of value."
0,"At the king’s command, all gold and other forms of precious metals were seized until the citizens had none."
0,The king forced the people to live five years without.
0,"Chaos ensued as the people tried to find other means of transaction, but the king expected this."
0,"At the end of that five year probation, a fourth of the population had either died or left, but no man was wealthier than the next."
0,They had learned how to trade services in exchange for others.
0,The country learned to live without currency.
0,"“Seeing this, my great grandfather introduced money back into society, but different than it had been before."
0,He gave all equally to every man.
0,"The people were to use the gold to allow exchange of services to those they could not provide a needed service in return, but on the condition that the money would be collected at the end of the day and redistributed the following morning."
0,"Those who were most productive and earned more gold were able to pay for more services and live better for a moment of time, but at the end of the day, all were equal once again.”"
0,"“I think I can understand the reasoning, but that is still far different than what I saw on the streets,” I replied."
0,"“What you saw was due to my father’s genius, and in turn, mine."
0,"By my father’s reign, word had gotten out into the world that a kingdom existed that gave gold freely."
0,"People gathered in alarming numbers, and as the population grew, the gold diminished."
0,"People would immigrate to the kingdom, receive gold, and leave."
0,The world’s greed was undermining my great grandfather’s charity.
0,This is when my father built the wall.
0,"As you may have noticed, it was meant to keep people in."
0,Those who had received of the king’s kindness were no longer able to leave with it.
0,"Even so, people still wanted in."
0,"My father closed the gates, and to prevent people from infiltrating, he built the wall even higher."
0,"“Once my father died, I became king."
0,"Where he saw the world as a threat, I saw it as an opportunity."
0,"The world may have greed, but it also has wealth and innovation."
0,"I opened the gate to visitors, but limited them in order to keep track of them better.”"
0,"“Is that where the marks come in?” I asked, holding up my hand."
0,“Those marks were the first success of allowing visitors through the walls.
0,I’m sure you have met the commander who brought you in at the gate.”
0,I nodded.
0,“He was one of the first.
0,"At that time, all visitors received a chance to meet the king of this great country."
0,"When all were gathered here again before leaving the country, some could not be found."
0,They had blended into the populous.
0,This is when he spoke up.
0,He suggested the idea of marking the visitors to distinguish them from a resident.
0,I immediately gave him charge of this task and allowed him to live within the walls.”
0,“But what do the marks mean?” I asked.
0,“What is the difference between them?”
0,"“Privilege,” The king replied."
0,“A black mark sets you no different than a common working civilian in my kingdom and the gold they receive each day is the same.
0,"Red is equivalent to merchants, shop owners who are the more productive of the population."
0,Merchants receive more gold due to the inputs required for their product.”
0,“Then what is the blue?”
0,"“You heard the answer in the throne room,"" the king replied."
0,"""You are a privileged visitor."
0,The men at the exchange assess the visitor's ability to benefit our country and mark them accordingly.
0,Those like you who are educated receive blue markings and are given twice the merchant class allowance with the hope of you seeing more of the city and finding areas of improvement.
0,The red markings go to those who brought some of their own currency to add to my kingdom's treasury.
0,"Black marks are assigned to everyone else."""
0,"""But I think the commander gaveme a blue mark out of pity, not by my education."""
0,"""All the same, it was wise for him to do so."
0,"If not, you may never have come to me with that proposal."""
0,"I stood silent thinking about all the king had said, but there was something he left out of the explanation."
0,"""Why is the gold poisonous?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""There is an odd silver metal near the eastern wall of my country."
0,Prolonged contact to it was known to cause sickness and even death.
0,"From my great grandfather's time, no one ever knew what purpose it could have."
0,It was I who found that purpose.
0,"Using criminals and those unable to be productive elsewhere, I ordered the mining of the metal and had it minted into the coins."""
0,"Now I understood why everyone, especially the butcher, was trying to better others in similar professions."
0,To mine a poisonous metal was a death sentence.
0,"""But why would you poison the gold?"""
0,I asked again.
0,"""If everyone knew the reason, the reason for doing so would be undone."
0,"If you are as intelligent as I believe you are, the answer will become clear should you look for it."
0,But I will say that it is one of the reasons we only keep visitors here for a week.
0,The amount of the metal in the coins is only fatal over time.
0,"By handling the coins, symptoms start to show at two weeks."""
0,“Isn’t that dangerous?”
0,“That is the point.
0,"I admit that many died at first, especially children and the elderly, but the populous adapted, and now poison cases among the citizens are unheard of.”"
0,I could not believe what I was hearing.
0,Was the king mad?
0,The king held up his hand and a man in a red robe with a single dye pouch on his waist approached.
0,"""Hold out your hand,"" the king ordered."
0,"I held out my hand, and the man began rubbing off the blue mark."
0,"""All I have told you about my kingdom is in gratitude for the innovation you bring with you and out of necessity of the position you now hold."""
0,"The robed man painted on a new blue mark, but this time with the tail looping up to the hook as I had seen in the two men from last night and the man who went before me to see the king."
0,"""You are now one of the king's privileged,"" the king informed me."
0,"""As such, you no longer have a time limit for your stay."
0,You may receive money upon request at the exchange in order to see all that this city has to offer.
0,In turn you are tasked with continuing to find means of improvement.
0,You are also able to leave and enter the wall at your leisure if you register your name at the exchange.
0,"However, should you do so, you are required to bring with you new innovation from the outside world to retain your privileged status upon your next arrival."""
0,The king walked with me back inside.
0,"""You may take your leave,"" the king told me."
0,"Pointing to a knight guarding the balcony, he ordered him to escort me outside."
1,"The king walked down to the stairs we had come up, but I was led in the opposite direction."
0,"Once at the door at the end of the mirrored hall, I stopped the guard."
0,"""I had a blanket confiscated from me before I saw the king."
0,"I cannot leave until I get it back."""
0,"The knight walked me back to the room where people awaited their audience with the king, or now possibly the king's advisor if the king had not returned to his throne room."
0,"A different group of people were gathered in waiting, but the guards were the same."
0,I approached the guard who had confiscated my blanket and requested it back.
0,"""All gifts to the king are final,"" the knight replied."
0,"""Gift?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""I thought you confiscated it due to foreign objects being prohibited."""
0,"""Then you should have informed us it was a child's blanket, not a gift,"" the guard laughed."
0,My hands balled into fists.
0,I took a step at the guard but had to stop myself.
0,I did not want another incident like the one at the sparing field.
0,And idea came to me.
0,I held up my mark to the guard.
0,"""I am privileged of the king."
0,"I demand my blanket back."""
0,This only served to make the guard laugh harder.
0,"""Then you are all the more indebted to the king for the favor he has shown you."
0,"Take the child away,"" he ordered the knight."
0,"The knight placed his cold mail hand on my shoulder, but I shook it off and walked towards the mirrored hall."
0,I left the hall under escort by the knight.
1,"With the castle at my back, I never wanted to see it again."
0,I had grown tired of this gilded city.
0,"“You are back much later today,” the knight with the blue cape said from the stone arch of the exchange."
0,"“I was held up,” I replied."
0,“I assume you do not need me to show you where to get your daily allowance or mark renewed.”
0,"“I won’t be needing it renewed,” I replied as I lifted up my hand."
0,The knight grabbed my wrist and admired the mark.
0,“I knew I saw something special in you.
0,Congratulations are in order.”
0,The knight placed his hand on my back and walked me into the exchange.
0,This time we entered the building instead of walking up to one of the busy market stalls.
0,Inside he brought me to the same bearded man who had given me my first mark.
0,"“Look at what our boy has done,” the knight said cheerfully."
0,"The old man leaned over the table as he stroked his beard, but once he saw my mark, his hand stopped."
0,"“Well, I never would have guessed,” he replied rather elated."
0,"He waved his hand, and a red robed man handed him a scroll."
0,"“This is the king’s register,” he explained."
0,“Your name will be recorded here.”
0,"“No,” I replied."
0,“That will not be necessary.”
0,“I don’t see why not?” the knight said.
0,"“I have no name, and I don’t plan on returning once I leave.”"
0,My reply was met with confusion.
0,"I contemplated requesting to leave now, but there was something I wanted to do before."
0,“The king said I am able to receive gold upon request.
0,Is that true?” I asked.
0,"“It is,” the bearded man replied."
0,“How much am I allowed to have on me at once?”
0,The knight and the bearded man stared at each other.
0,"“As much as you could carry, I guess,” the knight replied, sounding rather confused."
0,"“But because you can return for more, there is not really a need to carry a substantial amount.”"
0,I thought about how much I should ask for.
0,"Although I could carry as much as I wanted, I did not want to create a scene."
0,"Thinking of the weight of the sixty gold coins I was given when I arrived, I found the amount."
0,“Give me one thousand.”
0,“One thousand?” the bearded man asked in disbelief.
0,“What would you need that much at once for?” the knight asked.
0,“Investing.”
0,The knight left the room and came back with two robed men carrying a total of five large bags of gold.
0,“Are you sure you will be able to carry all this?” he asked as the bags were set on the table.
0,“I shouldn’t have a problem.” 
0,"I picked up the bags, three in my right and two in my left, and headed for the door."
0,Everyone in the garden market looked my way as I walked through.
0,No small amount of commotion was raised as visitors asked why I was able to receive such a large amount of gold.
0,Knights were brought in to keep orders and secure me a path out the stone archway.
1,I walked up the road and entered the city.
0,My first stop was the stream to the right where the young girl tirelessly worked for her mother.
0,"As expected, there she sat with raw hands scrubbing other people’s clothing in the cold river."
0,"Without a word, I set one of the five bags next to her."
0,"“Wha-what is this for?” She asked, flabbergasted."
0,Her mother came running out after seeing me with my mountain of gold.
0,"“To thank you for teaching me how to wash the blood out of my clothes,” I told the girl."
0,I then turned to her mother.
0,“I give this gold to her.
0,"You may make use of it on two conditions, you let her rest when she is tired and you don’t turn down someone in need like you turned me down.”"
0,The girl’s mother looked at me without speaking a word.
0,"“Save it for when the guards come on days when you have little business,” I instructed her before walking back up the river."
1,I made my way back to the main street and followed the roads the bard had taken back to the small inn.
0,"I knocked on the door, and the wife opened."
0,Her hand rose to her mouth in surprise.
0,She called her husband.
0,"When they were both at the door, I handed one of the bags to the couple."
0,“Use this to help get the word out about your inn.
0,"It is a brilliant idea, and I would like to see it succeed.”"
0,"Without waiting for a response, I walked back down the alley to the main street."
1,"Once at the center square, I headed left until I found the garden I had tried to sleep in and retraced my steps to the butcher’s shop."
0,Inside I found May selling a customer some animal fat.
0,"Once the business was finished and the customer had left the shop, May ran to me."
0,“How did it go?
0,Where did all this money come from?” She asked.
0,I set the gold bags on the floor and showed May my hand.
0,“Then it was successful?” She asked.
0,“Where’s your father?” I asked I return.
0,“He’s in the back.
0,"We just had our first customer in days, so he had to find the best meat we had, but he was just here for fat."
0,I’m sure he heard us.
0,He’ll be out once he’s cleaned up.”
0,"As May had stated, the butcher appeared from the back a few minutes later."
0,He ran to me and repeated May’s former questions.
0,"“It did not go as well as planned,” I explained."
0,"“The king did like the idea, but even though I tried to convince him to let you be the first to implement the summer storage, he ordered that all butcheries be ready for it by winter, so you are no better off than you were before."
0,Sorry.”
0,The butcher sat on a stool and sighed in relief.
0,“Then we are still better off.
0,"If we make it to winter, how fast meat sells will not matter."
0,I will be able to supply meat as good as any other butchers.
0,You have still helped us in the end.”
0,"“If we make it to winter,” May repeated."
0,"“That’s what this is for,” I said picking up the bags of gold and setting them in front of the butcher."
0,"“I don’t know how good you are as a butcher, but after all the trades you have done, if this is what you are best at, this is what you should be doing.”"
0,The butcher eyed the money in disbelief.
0,"After trying to speak but failing, the butcher grabbed May by the hand and stood her before me."
0,“There is no way I can repay this debt.
0,"In exchange, I offer you my daughter’s hand.”"
,“Father!” May called out.
0,“He’s at least four years younger than me.”
0,Warm pressure built in my face as I tried to find something to say.
0,“Well within reasonable range.
0,You have yet to find a suitor and you will soon be past your prime.”
0,"“Only because you chase away any suitors,” May protested."
0,"“All the more reason,” the butcher asserted."
0,“I approve of this one.”
0,"Taking a deep breath to calm my head, I spoke up before the butcher tried to solidify any deals."
0,"“Thank you, but I respectfully refuse,” I told him."
0,“It would not be in her best interest.”
0,"“Nonsense,” the butcher replied."
0,"“If you have no home, you can live here and I can take you on as an apprentice.”"
0,"“Again, I must decline,” I tried to tell him."
0,“I don’t plan on staying here.”
0,“Then marry her and take her with you out of the city.
0,"That mark gives you that option, and it’s the only way May will be free of this place.”"
0,"“Listen to the boy, papa.” "
0,"Seeing that he could not get his way, the butcher sat back on his stool."
0,"“If not my daughter, how can I replay you?” the butcher asked."
0,"“Consider it a long term investment,” I said."
0,The butcher nodded in understanding.
0,“You are not coming back.”
0,I shook my head.
0,“No.”
0,"“If you ever do, you are always welcome here,” the butcher said."
0,"I walked to the door, but before I could leave, the butcher held out his hand."
0,"“We are forever in your debt.” We shook, and I left for the exchange."
1,“Spent it all already?” the knight with the blue cape asked from the stone arch.
0,"“I had to repay some debts, and I have no use for money,” I replied."
0,“Then all is well in the end.
0,You couldn’t have taken the money out with you anyway.
0,Everything given must be returned when you leave.”
0,“When and where do you let people out of the wall?” I asked.
0,“You have not changed your mind about leaving?”
0,I shook my head.
0,"“Most people want to stay longer,” the knight said."
0,"“I don’t think I have known anyone who did not want to stay their full week, but I have no right to stop you."
0,You can wait with the carts until it is time to depart.”
0,"""You don't let people out the same gate they came in?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""No, there is one a couple hour's travel from here."
0,"I escort the caravan, so I will be joining you."
0,"It won't be for a few hours, but you are free to wait."""
1,I thanked the knight and walked over to the carts and sat on the tailboard to wait.
0,"As people filed into the carts, more carts arrived to fill the need."
0,It seemed today was another day when many would have to depart.
0,"None of the people looked pleased to go, and some of them looked pale."
0,"As I had seen before, there was one man who protested being made to leave, but this time the knights were able to apprehend him and tie him up."
0,I could not see why anyone wanted to stay.
0,Did they not see in their seven days what I had in two?
0,"To my count, sixty-four were loaded in the carts when the commander returned riding a horse."
0,"Including me, there were seven in mine."
0,I remained on the tailboard when the commander signaled the departure.
1,"As the caravan departed, more knights on horseback straddled the carts."
0,"I had expected the commander to lead the caravan, but he stayed at the rear following right behind the last cart, mine."
0,The caravan followed left down a road along the wall.
0,"Those behind me in the cart conversed about their time in the city, their impressions, what they were able to do, and even their exploits."
0,One young man even bragged that he was able to make most of the shops he visited beg for their payment before he would give it to them.
0,"His felicity mad me sick, and it was not welcomed by the majority of my cart."
0,"I was about to request a change in carts, but the commander rode up beside the man and hit him in the back of the head with the pommel of his sword."
0,The man fell unconscious to the floor of the cart.
0,I thanked him for settling the annoyance.
1,It was late afternoon when the caravan stopped next to a large fortified building that stood beside the wall.
0,"Due being disconnected, I doubted this was the exit gate."
0,The commander rode ahead and talked with the other knights.
0,He then stood in view of all the carts.
0,"""There are twelve dead among you,"" he called out."
0,I stood up in my cart and looked over at the other carts.
0,Knights were removing limp bodies and setting them off the road.
0,Two knights came to our cart and checked the unconscious man on the floor.
0,"Seeing that he was yet alive, they instead turned to a woman I thought had been sleeping in the corner."
0,"When they pulled her off the side, I noticed her face was pale."
0,This created no small stir among the other visitors.
0,"""Those of you who are also feeling ill, I ask that you cooperate with us if you do not want to end up like these twelve."
0,"If you want to survive, we will need to question you inside."
0,"If you refuse, you may not make it to the gate alive."
0,"Those who comply, should you survive your illness until morning, will be released and brought to the gate tomorrow."""
0,"At the commander's word, no less than twenty exited the carts and were brought inside by the knights garrisoned at the building."
0,Two of the men riding in my cart were included.
0,One in particular who had remained silent for the duration of the ride was rather pale.
1,"Once all who left the carts were brought within the confines of the building, the commander signaled for the caravan to continue down the road and took his place behind me."
0,"""Does this have something to do with the money?"""
0,I asked him.
0,"""I guess being privileged of the king you were told about the gold."
0,"Yes,"" he replied."
0,"""What's wrong with the gold?"""
0,the last remaining woman on my cart asked.
0,"""It's toxic,"" I replied."
0,I looked back at the commander.
0,"""I assume it is fine for them to know at this point now that they are leaving the city?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""I see no harm,"" he replied."
0,"""Those wretched thieves who died thought they could hide the gold where we couldn't find it."
0,"It only served to kill them faster."""
0,I thought about what the commander said.
0,"""They swallowed it."""
0,"""Either swallowing it or inserting it wherever it will fit."
0,"Either way, the same happens."
0,The poison kills them.
0,"The more they ingest, the faster they die."
0,"We detain the sick ones to make sure they aren't just weaker people who got sick from prolonged contact with the gold, but if they swallowed even one coin, they will be dead by morning."""
0,"Hearing this, the woman reached in her cleavage and pulled out three gold coins and tossed them on the floor of the carriage."
0,"I picked them up, and the commander rode close to retrieve them."
0,"""Is that all you had on you?"""
0,he asked the woman.
0,"""Yes,"" she said, panicked."
0,"""Good."
0,I will forgive your theft this time.
0,"Should you have waited until we found out at the gate, you would have been executed."""
0,"Hearing the commander's words, the woman fainted, falling across the bench on her side of the cart."
0,The man across from her began to quiver.
0,"In an instant, he jumped over me onto the road and ran back towards the city."
0,"""Why do they run?"""
0,the commander moaned.
0,He gave the man a small start before charging after on his horse.
0,"The man, seeing the knight charging, picked up a large rock and threw it."
0,The rock made contact with the side of the commander's head.
0,"This served to slow the commander down, but only so that he could draw his sword."
0,"Once the commander charged again, the man was finished."
0,The sword pierced the man's back and felled him to the dusty earth.
0,The commander returned to the caravan and ordered one the many knights flanking it to tend to the body.
0,He then returned to following behind my cart.
0,Just above his ear was a small red mark.
0,"I pointed to the same location on my head, and the commander touched it with his gauntlet."
0,"Seeing the blood, he sighed."
0,"""Nothing to worry about,"" he said."
0,"""Did you have to kill him?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""People try to run rather often, but I can usually persuade them to return."
0,"If they become hostile, it's because they were trying to smuggle something out of the kingdom."""
0,"""Gold again?"""
0,"""Or other valuables."
0,"I told you before, but everything must be returned before you leave."
0,"Aside from you, that is."""
0,"""What do you mean?"""
0,"""Seeing that no one is able to listen, I can tell you."""
0,I looked at the seats behind me.
0,Only the woman lying across her bench and the man on the floor were left in my cart.
0,"""Those privileged of the king are searched like everyone else,"" the commander continued, ""but they are given a small traveler's purse."
0,"In a sense, it is like payment for what they have contributed to the kingdom."""
0,"“You were the first, right, to become privileged of the king?” I asked."
0,"""You heard this in the castle?"""
0,The knight unlatched and removed his right gauntlet.
0,On the back of his hand was the same blue mark permanently inked into the skin.
0,"""Almost twenty-five years ago,"" he said."
0,"""Before that, I was a farm hand."
0,"The idea for the marks came from my experience branding livestock."""
0,"""After being here for over twenty years, what is you honest opinion of this kingdom?"""
0,I asked.
0,The commander replaced his gauntlet and thought for a moment.
0,"""I love it,"" he replied."
0,"""Even with the terrible things that happen here?"""
0,"""Terrible?"""
0,the commander repeated.
0,"""No country is perfect."
0,"Some of what we do might seem questionable to an outsider, but for me, I found my place here."
0,"With that mark, you could have stayed here indefinitely, but if this city it not for you, that's all there is."
0,"You'll find your place somewhere."""
0,"Not having a home, I had to think again about whether or not I could live here."
0,"Like the commander, could I have gotten accustomed enough to see beyond the evils of this kingdom?"
0,"Try as I might, I could not overlook a king who cares more that his gold stays within the kingdom than the health of his own people."
0,"Coming to this conviction, I remained silent for the remainder of the trip."
1,The road twisted behind a hill set against the wall.
0,Gates of a smaller wall opened into a large dirt enclosure where the caravan stopped and the carts lined up.
0,Behind us the gate closed.
0,"Lining the width of the enclosure was customs, large wooden booths where those leaving were searched."
0,"After everyone left their carts and gathered, the commander rode to the front to once again address the crowd."
0,"""I would like to thank you for visiting our fine country,"" he announced."
0,"""You will each be brought through customs."
0,Everything that was given for the joy of your stay must now be returned.
0,"This includes money that you had not given back at the exchange, accessories, and clothing."
0,"Withholding or hiding any of these items will be considered theft and shall be punished accordingly."""
0,Whispers erupted from the crowd.
0,Most of the people were either carrying items bought in the city or at least wearing the high-class clothing sold to visitors.
0,"""While all items bought must be returned, we do understand that many of you have prepared for your travels."
0,"As such, you may keep any food you have."
0,It is not our desire for you to starve.
0,"Now, a knight will escort you one by one through customs."
0,Any aggression or resistance will be answered tenfold.
0,"For your safety, I ask for your cooperation."""
0,The knight began taking people one by one into the booths.
0,It soon became apparent that many were not willing to give up what they had acquired in the city.
0,The first man yelled at the guard who demanded to see what he had in his bag.
0,"The bag was torn from his hands, and he was forced to his knees."
0,The contents were dumped on the dusty ground.
0,Amidst the food were jewelry and a small bag of gold.
0,The man was executed right then for all to witness.
0,"Having seen an example of what resisting accomplished, the next to be brought through customs were more willing to cooperate."
0,"It was required that all were to strip in order to be searched, but large brown blankets were held up to keep them covered from the crowd."
0,Those who had bought clothing in the city and no longer carried their own were given the blanket as their sole covering.
0,"The precession continued as many passed through customs, but many others were caught trying to smuggle something out and executed."
0,"The bodies were carried away, whether clothed or not, and tossed onto a cart to the side."
0,"When it became time for the lady before me, she refused to remove her clothing in front of the knights and asked that a woman examine her."
0,"Before the situation escalated, the commander took control and explained that there were no women among their numbers."
0,"In exchange, he would see her through customs personally, and swore on his honor than should she be compliant with the law, nothing would happen to her."
0,Both the knight working the customs and his assistant were made to hold up the large blanket and face the crowd.
0,"In a shorter time than most others had taken to pass through customs, the commander grabbed the corners of the large blanket and wrapped it around the woman."
0,He then led her through.
1,My turn had come.
0,The commander remained in the booth to oversee my passage through customs.
0,"""Aren't you going back out to oversee the others going through?"""
0,I asked him.
0,"""I would have been called here anyway."
0,"I work with the king's privileged personally,"" he replied."
0,"""How did you get that woman to cooperate?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Not everyone who protests is doing something illegal."
0,"When this happens especially with women, I step in, keep them calm by talking about my own wife and daughter, and move them through as fast as possible."""
0,I smiled.
0,"""You are a good person."""
0,The commander laughed.
0,"""I'm glad you think so."""
0,"""But may I make a suggestion?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Of course."""
0,"""Train a woman to work the customs to prevent future trouble."""
0,"""Is this your last bit of insight before you leave?"""
0,the knight asked.
0,"""Bring it to the king."
0,You can take credit if you like.
0,"It makes no difference to me."""
0,"""Thank you, but I must say that idea is not new."
0,"I have yet to find a woman able to keep up with the knight's regiment or stomach customs inspections especially when killing is a daily occurrence."""
0,"""I might know one."
0,"May, the daughter of Merek the butcher."""
0,The commander laughed again.
0,"""You know, a butcher's daughter might just work."
0,I'll have to ask.
0,"Now, we must not keep the people waiting."""
0,"At his command, I removed my clothing."
0,The commander's demeanor changed.
0,He walked over and knelt in front of me.
0,"""What happened?"""
0,he asked.
0,"""I thought that might have been blood on your clothing."
0,"You didn't have this when you arrived, did you?"""
0,I had forgotten about the cut on my stomach.
0,"It had mostly healed by now, but the dead skin on the edges was dry and cracking in the heat."
0,"""It wasn't serious,"" I replied."
0,"""When did it happen?"""
0,I thought back to my duel with the knight.
0,"""I did it to myself."
0,"I will be alright,"""
0,"""You should rest until you are well."
0,"Is that injury why you are so adamant about leaving the city?"""
0,"""I will not stay any longer."
0,"I'm sorry."""
0,The commander did not argue further.
0,He searched my clothing and handed it back.
0,"Untying a small bag from his waist, he handed it to me."
0,"""This is your purse,"" he said."
0,"I opened it up, and inside were non-minted pieces of silver."
0,"""Silver?"""
0,"""Our gold is poisoned, right?"""
0,the commander jested.
1,"With my search completed, the knight walked me through to the other side of the enclosure."
0,There the gate opened into a similar hallway like I had seen at the tower on my way in through the wall.
0,"In the center, a group of four people waited."
0,I tied my silver on the inside of my trousers to keep the others from noticing.
0,"When I joined the group, the knights on the other side opened the gate."
0,"""The hallway opens up into the forest,"" the knight informed us."
0,"""If you head straight you will find a road."
0,"For your safety, we suggest staying together until you meet the road."""
0,"After the small instruction, we were led to the end of the hall to a larger gate that opened as we approached."
0,"Once outside the wall, the gate closed."
1,There was no road leading out from this gate.
0,"Instead, dirt paths led in all directions."
0,"The knight had said that the road was out straight from the wall, so I walked in that direction."
0,"""If we follow the wall, we can get back to the gate,"" one man in the group said."
0,"""Maybe we'll be able to get back in!"""
0,"The other two men liked the idea and agreed, but the woman who had gone before me did not like the idea of traveling with the three men."
0,"As they ran off along the wall, the woman stood wondering whether or not to follow."
0,"In the end, she decided to walk with me."
0,"Once we were far from the wall, a male scream echoed in the distance."
0,Something must have been awaiting the men along the wall.
0,"When the forest broke, a road was visible across a small field."
0,"There, the woman parted in one direction and I the other."
1,A short distance further I ran into an impoverished couple and their weak young child.
0,"""We heard there was a charitable king in this land,"" the husband said."
0,"""If you know of him, could you tell us where it is?"""
0,I looked at the destitute family.
0,"Removing my small bag of silver, I handed it to them."
0,They opened it and began to cry.
0,"""This is so much,"" the wife said."
0,"""Can we really accept this?"""
0,"""You will find no charity here; only thieves in kings' robes."""
0,I walked past them down the road as they stood in awed silence.
