“Self-Loathing” 
Eydis"
1,Dim yellow light pierced the darkness revealing a blend of subdued browns and shadows.
0,"The sole distinguishable feature of the scenery was the light’s source, a small, glowing yellow orb affixed to the ceiling."
0,"The only sounds in the haze of dull colors were an incessant mechanical hum and the first groan of the room’s waking occupant, Eydis FeAmel."
0,“Aahh…” Eydis’s memories were just as clouded as her eyes.
0,She did not know this place.
0,Training.
0,Who’s training?
0,Symra’s?
0,Evhial’s?
0,"Yes, Evhial’s."
0,Life magic.
0,"Eydis tried using life magic to clear the haze in her eyes, but she struggled to think of the right magic to use, and her ven was unresponsive."
0,"Symra’s training, then, she thought, but Eydis could not move her arms."
0,She could not feel them.
0,"She only felt cold, sick."
0,“Where… Hel…”
0,The haze found motion in the rampant patter of feet down what sounded like creaking wood steps.
0,"A shadow loomed over Eydis in the shape of a person, blocking the light."
0,Two red dots glowed at the eyes.
0,Eydis felt herself wrenched from the ground.
0,A burning pain in her shoulder that made her cry out increased the cold sickness she felt.
0,"The haze darkened, and the last Eydis saw in the blackness was two small red dots."
1,"Dim yellow light broke the darkness, and the blend of dull colors found shape."
0,Eydis instinctively silenced the groan that nearly passed her lips.
0,"Something, she felt, should not be alerted."
0,The two red dots should not know she woke.
0,"Instead, Eydis blinked more clarity into her eyes."
0,"A crude wooden stairway rose to the left, and shelves lined the far wall, but the scene would not focus enough to show what sat on them."
0,In the back right corner stood a tower of brown boxes; maybe cardboard.
0,"Eydis did not recognize this place, but the incandescent light bulb glowing on the ceiling showed she was still somewhere on Earth, possibly--hopefully--still in Gullivan."
0,"After a deep breath, Eydis tried to sit up, but her wrists would not part."
0,Something cold and rigid bound them behind her back.
0,"She tried to move her legs, but the same cold rigidity bound them as well."
0,"Every ounce of her will was required to pull her knees up to her chest, and she could not find the energy to roll onto them to sit up."
0,"The ground was paved, and she felt the grating texture against the skin of her legs."
0,"She noticed the same grating chill on her hip, shoulder, and arm."
0,Only now did she realize that she was not just bound but also naked.
0,Eydis looked down at the binds of her ankles and saw two shining silver shackles chained together.
0,"They glimmered with a dull, light-blue hue; fahil, a rare metal that, though brittle on its own, when made into an alloy it could become stronger than steel."
0,"Pure fahil was silver, almost white in color, giving it the name of fa-hil or white-iron."
0,Common alloys of the metal tinted it blue.
0,The chains were an alloy to increase their strength and decrease the brittleness of the pure metal.
0,Her captor did not want her to escape.
0,"No barrier Eydis created could break such binds, and wind could hardly cut them."
0,Life magic was useless against metal.
0,"She could teleport, but if these binds were fahil, there was a greater risk."
0,"Resfahil, an even rarer form of the metal, was impervious to, and even dispelled most magic."
0,"It could not be manufactured but was said to have appeared from the cataclysm that destroyed the first civilization on Whinhlem, a remnant of divine anger for breaking universal taboo."
0,"The nature of the taboo had been forgotten to all but the ageless, but given the metal’s distaste for magic, it was commonly believed that some forbidden magic was the cause of the first civilization’s downfall."
0,Resfahil made portals highly unstable due to its magic resistance.
0,"If resfahil needed to be transported by teleportation, it was sent on its own."
0,"Eydis could open a portal with her hands bound and try to crawl through, but if this was resfahil, she could expect to be highly wounded if not dead when she exited the other side."
0,"Wearing resfahil, including simple accessories, was banned for the royal family so that the spatial magic guard, the Namie, could evacuate the royal family quickly in emergencies."
0,Emer demonstrated the reason for the ban in one of his earlier spatial magic lessons using a small resfahil ring and a live fowl.
0,The mangled and bloody bird was all she needed to see to be fearful of wearing any.
0,A door opened out of sight atop the stairs.
0,Eydis acted as if she was asleep to not alert whoever approached.
0,The boards of the stairs creaked less under the lighter steps of the new arrival.
0,The unknown individual walked around out of sight behind Eydis.
0,Eydis felt so vulnerable in her nakedness.
0,"She did not know who this individual was, but all of Eydis was bare for them to see."
0,"Metal creaked behind her, followed by the sound of scraping."
0,"Crackling accompanied faint warmth, and Eydis realized that the new arrival lit a fire."
0,"“Sorry,” the arrival, a girl, said in a quiet voice before returning up the stairs."
0,Eydis chanced a quick glance at her and saw a young Forrest Elf girl in a yellow floral dress.
0,"From the angle, Eydis saw her, the girl looked familiar, but Eydis could not be sure."
0,"This room was clearly on Earth, not Whinhlem, so why was there a Forrest Elf here?"
0,"Once the girl was gone and the door atop the steps closed, Eydis turned her head to see the source of the subtle warmth."
0,"A small black furnace crackled with flame, and the metal pan beside it was filled with ash."
0,The girl’s apology was possibly from letting the fire die.
0,"There was only a small wood billet in the furnace and no other around it, so perhaps the apology was due to the lack of fuel."
0,The fire produced from the single billet was small.
0,Eydis grew confused.
0,"The red eyes and pain in her shoulder still haunted her like a horrible nightmare, as if her naked imprisonment wasn’t nightmare enough, but now a Forrest Elf girl was taking care of her and even apologized."
0,"Over the following hour of solitude as the fire removed the edge of the chilling sickness Eydis felt, she tried to remember what happened and how she got here."
0,The last clear memory Eydis had was arriving with Justin in the health and fitness building to prepare for her self-defense class.
0,"She went to change in the changing room attached to a restroom next to the small classrooms where she had formerly taught her friends magic, but as soon as she entered the changing stall she was teleported into a snowy field."
0,A fight ensued.
0,She was overwhelmed.
0,Someone saved her.
0,"There was a Lurr, a Lurr that looked just like her."
0,Her doppelganger.
0,And that doppelganger attacked her.
0,The glowing red eyes and pain she felt in that nightmare of a memory made sense now.
0,The severity of her situation finally hit her.
0,"This building, wherever it was, was the Lurr’s den, and Eydis was imprisoned as the Lurr’s source of food."
0,She had to escape.
0,"She had to return to Justin and Sammy and warn them, not only about Tolmyur finally coming to Earth but also that Lurr had arrived with them."
0,An idea came.
0,"Even if a portal might be lethal when entered, it might still be of use."
0,"If she created one and let part of the chain through, when it collapsed from the metal’s disruption, the chain might sever."
0,"Eydis created the formula for a small portal near her hands, but when she tried to tear it open, she found her ven unresponsive, and the attempt only increased cold shivers that the fire could not ebb."
0,She was far past the critical point.
0,Her ven levels were too low.
0,"The doppelganger was preying on her, and so long as she did, Eydis would be unable to use magic."
0,The fahil shackles were only an extra precaution.
0,Eydis had trained in using ven below dangerous levels under Symra.
0,She was able to give all her ven to Justin when she expelled his toxic ven in an emergency.
0,She could do it again.
0,"Using the teleportation formula she created, she forced out the ven her body withheld."
0,"Her finger entered a crack in space, and she peeled it open."
0,"The portal was incredibly unstable due to her low ven, and Emer would berate her to no end for trying to create a portal with her ven so low, but she did not need to enter."
0,She wanted the portal to collapse.
0,"She slipped the chain into the small crack in space, and immediately sparks flew from the portal collapsing."
0,The metal was a rasfahil alloy.
0,The edges of the portal closed around the section of chain but could not sever it.
0,The chain sparked and heated as it barely held the portal open until the portal spat it back out intact.
0,"The yellow-hot chain slapped her forearm, burning her."
0,Eydis hissed through her teeth and tried to hold her arms as far away as she could to keep the heated chain taut and away from her skin.
0,She could not hold the position for long but endured the debilitating shivers of ven exhaustion until the chain cooled.
0,She then collapsed to the ground.
0,Eydis could not find the energy to try again.
0,"She lay on the cold cement floor as the fire slowly died, removing her sole feeling of warmth, to await the return of the monster."
0,“Justin… Sammy…”
0,Tears welled in Eydis’s eyes.
0,She whimpered the only names in which she could find comfort despite knowing that they had no way to find her.
0,"For the first time since arriving on this world, she was alone."
1,Eydis’s tears ran dry in the silently passing hours.
0,"She fought mentally to ignore the cold, but that only served to tire her more."
0,"She tried to change position to keep as much of her naked body off the cold floor as she could, but the chains were staked to the ground and too short to give much range of motion."
0,"After several attempts, she worked herself into a squat, but it did little to stop the shivering."
0,A door from the stairway.
0,The wooden steps creaked.
0,“You are looking much better today.”
0,"Someone with Eydis’s voice, face, and tattered clothes walked in carrying a bundle of wood under her arm."
0,The young Forrest Elf girl followed.
0,"Eydis knew her, Rynn."
0,"Her face was emotionless, and she held a bowl in both hands as she followed behind the doppelganger."
0,“You are probably hungry.”
0,"The doppelganger nodded to Rynn, and she set her bowl on the ground in front of Eydis."
0,It contained a thin vegetable soup.
0,"“Food here is a bit heavy, so this is probably more than enough."
0,Drink up.”
0,Eydis looked at the bowl.
0,"Her hands were shackled behind her back, giving her no way to lift it."
0,Eydis’s eyes met the doppelganger’s.
0,A sly grin that said “drink” grew on the doppelganger’s face.
0,The shackle chains extended just long enough for Eydis to bend down if she shifted her ankles as close to the stake as possible.
0,She placed her face in the bowl and sucked up the soup.
0,The doppelganger stoked the furnace with a content smile.
0,Eydis could not bend far enough down to drink the entire bowl.
0,"When she tried scooting the bowl closer with her chin, the bowl tipped, spilling what remained."
0,"Even though Earth food was dense and filling, that thin soup hardly sated her hunger."
0,"She hung her head low, weak and humiliated."
0,“That’s a waste.
0,I assume you are done?” 
0,The doppelganger handed the bowl to Rynn and ordered her to return upstairs.
0,“Why?” Eydis mumbled.
0,“Hmm?”
0,"Eydis shook her head, new tears running down her tear-stained cheeks."
0,"“Why are you doing this?” Eydis’s voice fell quiet, almost to a whisper."
0,“Why?
0,"The humans were increasing their search for you, sending more and more people to this world."
0,It was only a matter of time before they found you.”
0,That was not what Eydis wanted to know.
0,"In her confrontation with her doppelganger, she vaguely remembered her saying that she wanted to help her fight Jethro, and yet her doppelganger attacked her first."
0,“I had to keep them off your trail so that they would not learn you were walking out in the open like you were a human.
0,"Had they known you were living such a care-free life in this world, they would have found you much faster."
0,Those fools believed you sought asylum and kept looking for military or government facilities.”
0,"“I thought you wanted to help me fight Jethro,” Eydis said meekly, hoping to somehow turn the situation around."
0,"If cooperation was at all possible, she needed to grasp it before her situation grew more dire."
0,"However, her words had the opposite effect."
0,The doppelganger’s eyes flared red.
0,“Now you care about defeating Jethro?
0,"Now that I have you trapped, you want to save your people?!”"
0,She grabbed Eydis by her neck and lifted her until the chains binding her grew taut.
0,“You already made your choice to abandon the Amelian Empire.
0,"While you were living a peaceful life, my country fell to ruin!"
0,The capital city fell to the humans!
0,People live in fear and poverty.
0,"Meanwhile, you were laughing and chasing after a human male like some bitch in heat!” "
0,Eydis’s mind could not comprehend the doppelganger’s accusations.
0,The Amelian Empire was powerful.
0,"Tolmyur could never overpower them in such a short amount of time, even without her father."
0,She expected that the royal council would be more than sufficient to run the country in the absence of an Emperor or Empress.
0,What her doppelganger said had to be a lie.
0,"There was no way Amel would fall, but to Eydis’s horror, the doppelganger’s next words hammered in the truth of what was happening back on Whinhlem."
0,“The Amelian Empire is no more.
0,The races that once found protection under its banner now sell their liberties to the humans in fear.
0,"The pride of the fairies was crushed when they alone stood up to Tolmyur’s tyranny, spurring the largest genocide in history."
0,I would not be surprised if there were no fairies left by now… 
0,Even that half-breed mage who saved you is sharing everything he knows with the humans and making them even more powerful.” 
0,The doppelganger’s grip tightened.
0,Eydis could no longer breathe.
0,"Left to the mercy of her captor, tears flowed from her eyes."
0,Her consciousness was fading fast.
0,Her vision grew dark.
0,"When Eydis was about to lose herself, the doppelganger released her grip, dropping Eydis to her knees and to her side."
0,"Eydis gasped for breath, but a foot landed in her stomach, forcing her to her back and expelling the air she so desperately needed."
0,That same foot pressed down on Eydis’s chest.
0,The doppelganger looked down at her distressed face with disgust.
0,“Do you really think you deserve to return to your world?
0,"Do you really think that I would let you become a martyr after you abandoned your own people, after you abandoned girls like Rynn?"
0,Jethro will not have you.
0,You will not die for your people.
0,You will live in your shame until I am complete.
0,Then I will kill you myself.
0,It is only fair.
0,You created me to die in your place.
0,Now you will die so that I can live in this world in your place.
0,There is no empire for us to return to anyway.”
0,"The doppelganger lifted her foot, allowing Eydis to breathe a little easier."
0,“I had to wait a few days to make sure Tolmyur was off my trail.
0,They were observing me in secret somehow while I searched for you.
0,"I did not find anyone, so I think we are safe for now, but I am curious."
0,What is it about those humans you lived with that made you abandon your people?
0,What was his name?
0,Justin?
0,I feel it is time to pay your man a visit.
0,He is probably very worried about you.
0,I wonder… What should I do to him?”
0,"Eydis tried to call out, to plead for mercy, but only a desperate gasp for air escaped."
0,She could not let a Lurr near Justin.
0,He had provided for her.
0,He offered everything he had freely so that she could live as peacefully and happily as possible after losing her entire family and after having been sent to a strange and unfamiliar world.
0,Creak.
0,The doppelganger began climbing the steps.
0,Justin laughed with Eydis when she was happy.
0,He comforted her when she was sad or insecure.
0,"He shared with her his favorite foods, his favorite places, his favorite hobbies."
0,Creak.
0,He gave his home.
0,He gave his room.
0,He gave his money.
0,He gave his time.
0,He was always with her.
0,Creak.
0,He did all this without fear of those who were after her.
0,Creak.
0,Eydis remembered his warm hand clasped tightly in hers.
0,"When she was near him, when she held his hand, all worries felt so small."
0,"When she thought Justin wanted to send her away when a room opened in the girl’s dormitory, a deluge of anxiety swept her away like the sole anchor holding her steady in the storm had been cut loose."
0,The doppelganger was wrong.
0,"The state of her home, the Amelian Empire, was always on her mind."
0,She worried about it every day.
0,She had nightmares about it in her sleep.
0,"She could see the dead faces of her father, her brothers, her mother, and Ceil."
0,She could see the bodies of her people piling up in the streets.
0,The worry would have crushed her long ago if not for him.
0,Creak.
0,He was her support.
0,His reassuring smile brought peace.
0,"Justin was the only man who ever cared about her for who she was, who she truly was, not for what position she held."
0,The realization of her own feelings struck Eydis’s heart like lightning.
0,I love him…
0,Eydis forced out the dregs of her ven and pushed herself deeper into the critical levels.
0,She channeled everything into her feet.
0,"With as much strength her worn body could give, she kicked her legs at the doppelganger."
0,A blade of wind flew from her feet and cut through the wooden beams lining the stairs.
0,Rynn saw the blade and dove down the steps into the doppelganger.
0,The edge of the blade cut across the girl’s face as she and the doppelganger tumbled downward.
0,The blade imbedded into the wall and dispersed.
0,The light in the cellar went out.
0,Only the faint amber glow of the furnace lit the room.
0,The doppelganger scrambled in panic for Rynn who lay limp beside her.
0,Blood gushed from a line across Rynn’s cheek and past the bridge of her nose.
0,"The blade had carved deep, digging into bone."
0,She channeled life ven into her hand and immediately worked to stop the bleeding.
0,Rynn lost a lot of blood by the time the bleeding stemmed.
0,The doppelganger glared at Eydis with red eyes like burning coals in the dark.
0,She rushed to Eydis and grabbed the hair on the side of Eydis’s head.
0,Eydis swung her knees at the monster.
0,"She lacked the motion and ven to fully utilize Symra’s training, but the alignment of two key wellpoints in Eydis’s legs caused the monster’s knee to buckle when struck."
0,"This hardly perturbed the Lurr, and she slammed Eydis’s head into the cement floor."
0,Eydis’s head erupted in pain.
0,"Her head was slammed once more, blurring the crimson puddle that steadily grew in the corner of her vision."
0,"Eydis laid there, unwilling to surrender but unable to retaliate."
0,"Perhaps, she thought, this was proper punishment for failing to kill the doppelganger and instead harming Rynn who had always taken care of her and even now apologized for the cold, and who very well could have been captured by the monster."
0,The doppelganger pulled Eydis’s face close.
0,“Do you have any idea what that girl has been through?
0,She gave herself to Jethro’s men to protect her family and people.
0,"Do you have any idea the evils she’s witnessed, the horrors she’s experienced?"
0,"If you feel any remorse at all, you will wait here patiently for your death.”"
0,The doppelganger licked her lips.
0,"“But no, you would not care."
0,You only thought of protecting your human.
0,I need to ensure you can do nothing more to her.
0,I drained far too much the first few times I fed and nearly killed you.
0,I went easier after that but feared you were still too weak.
0,Now I know that I cannot hold back.”
0,The doppelganger pulled a small knife from her pocket and slit the side of Eydis’s neck.
0,She placed her mouth over the gushing wound and began sucking.
0,Eydis’s head grew light.
0,The cold hand of death caressed her body.
0,Her vision darkened.
0,Her body grew numb.
0,Only faint sounds reached her ears.
0,“You are lucky I cannot kill you yet.”
0,"The sound died, leaving only two red eyes in the darkness and a desperate cry for help in Eydis’s heart."
0,"Chapter 2
“Home Life”
Eydis"
1,Eydis successfully captured the princess and evaded Jethro’s men.
0,"Hidden in a house that no one visits on the edge of a residential district where the poor kept to themselves, Eydis felt safe."
0,"However, in her hubris after her hard-fought victory, she neglected to notice the danger she had brought inside that very house."
0,"A major oversight allowed the captive princess to severely injure Rynn, the adolescent Forrest Elf she saved from the lustful hands of the humans."
0,In her own underestimation of her original-- someone whose capabilities she should have known better than anyone--she let harm come to the girl for whom she obtained this home to shelter her from further harm.
0,Guilt ate at Eydis.
0,It twisted in her stomach.
0,Tears burned her eyes as they fell on the bloody face of the girl she swore to protect.
0,Eydis apologized again and again while carrying the light frame up the steps of the cellar and to the bedroom.
0,"She had originally planned to contact the princess’s human associates, but that plan had to wait."
0,Eydis focused all her efforts towards treating Rynn.
0,"Her education in the Amelian palace included practice in life magic, which she excelled at, but she was ill-prepared for something this severe."
0,Treating flesh wounds was simple.
0,"Accelerated healing through life magic fixed most damage, but it often left terrible scars that needed further treatment to erase."
0,Bone was far more difficult.
0,"Depending on the damage, accelerated healing could fuse the bone wrong, and if the bone was badly damaged, full repair was not possible."
0,"The cut Rynn received from the princess nicked her jawbone, shattered two upper molars, cut deep into her cheekbone, and extended through the bridge of her nose."
0,The gash barely missed both eyes.
0,"If Rynn had not been at the top of the stairs, if she had not seen the attack, Eydis would have lost her head."
0,That much was certain.
0,Rynn saved Eydis’s life.
0,Eydis worked to the best of her ability to regrow the bone carved out by the blade of wind.
0,"Once bone grew, it hardened and would not grow any further, so Eydis had to shave off some of the new bone to allow more to grow."
0,"The process was long and infuriating, and when her frustration peaked, she took it out on the unconscious elf in the cellar."
0,"The end result was poor, but she filled the carved line through Rynn’s cheekbone and jaw."
0,New flesh covered the damaged bone and hid Eydis’s unskilled work.
0,"Eydis lay on the floor tired and sweating, but Rynn rested soundly in her bed."
0,She barely had enough ven to finish the surgery and could feel the shivers of ven exhaustion.
0,"The remaining tissue damage could be dealt with after Eydis next fed on the princess, and if she was careful, no scar would remain."
0,“I guess I will wait another day…”
0,Eydis fell asleep on the floor.
1,"Eydis shifted and turned over in her sleep-drunkenness, pulling the blanket up close around her face."
0,"It faintly smelled of Rynn, slowly overpowering the former owner of the bed."
0,Something felt off.
0,Eydis woke with a start in the bed in which she thought she had placed Rynn.
0,She turned her head looking for the girl but did not find her in the sheets.
0,Rynn stood at the door holding a plate of flatbread.
0,"The girl had found flour, herbs, and greens, learned to use the peculiar range of this world, and prepared a simple meal."
0,“Food.”
0,“Did you lift me into bed?” 
0,Rynn nodded.
0,“Come here.”
0,The girl approached the bedside.
0,Eydis set the plate aside and pulled Rynn into an embrace.
0,"“I am sorry, and thank you."
0,Thank you for saving me.”
0,"Rynn shook her head, rejecting the earnest word of gratitude."
0,“Repayment.”
0,"When shown kindness, repay twofold; the first half of an ancient elven adage."
0,"Eydis saved Rynn, so Rynn felt it only natural to save Eydis."
0,"Eydis held the girl tighter, Rynn’s starched dress scraping against Eydis’s chest."
0,It was then that Eydis noticed that she was naked.
0,The shivers from ven exhaustion were also gone.
0,Rynn must have held her while she slept to help her recover.
0,The care Rynn took brought tears to Eydis’s eyes.
0,She pulled the girl off to look at her.
0,"The cut across Rynn’s face had begun scabbing over, although most of it was still raw."
0,"Even the light movement of the air would cause it to burn, yet the girl showed no sign of pain."
0,The poor girl was already accustomed to pain.
0,"“Eat,” Rynn said, looking down at the plate Eydis set aside."
0,The building tears fell loose from Eydis’s eyes when she nodded in agreement.
0,"Rynn sat on the bed beside Eydis, and they shared the heavy flatbread."
0,The quality of Rynn’s cooking surprised Eydis.
0,The ingredients of this world should have been foreign and yet she skillfully used them to make a meal that tasted similar in quality to what Eydis expected a baker to sell.
0,"It lacked the same quality as the bread Eydis ate in the palace, but it was not so far off."
0,"Due to the heavy nature of this world’s food, half the bread remained."
0,Rynn set it on the bedside table and extracted the moisture using simple water magic to dry it for later consumption.
0,"Eydis headed for the hallway to go to the kitchen, but Rynn rushed in front of her and blocked her path."
0,“I am only getting some water.”
0,Rynn shook her head.
0,“Rest.”
0,“You are the one who needs to rest.
0,"Despite the blood you lost, you still exerted yourself."
0,"You cannot see your own face, but I can."
0,You are pale.”
1,Eydis moved past Rynn into the kitchen and burst out laughing.
0,"She half expected a mess from how Rynn reacted, but what greeted her was flat bread in different degrees of being burnt piled all over the counters."
0,Various vials of spices scattered between the stacks of bread wherever they would fit.
0,"She walked over to a stack on one end and broke off a piece that was not burnt, ignoring the panicked waving of Rynn’s hands."
0,It tasted not too different from the bread she just ate.
0,"Thinking that it may have been one of the later incarnations, she went over to a stack on the opposite end of the counter but was surprised when that bread tasted exactly like the bread Rynn gave her."
0,She laughed again.
0,“What are you worried about?
0,All the bread is fine.”
0,Rynn shook her head.
0,"In all the time since Eydis took custody of Rynn, she never had the chance to see how Rynn acted in a home setting."
0,Rynn might have been a perfectionist.
0,Her skill in cooking was obvious; able to understand the nature of the ingredients she found in the kitchen and combined them into a passable meal.
0,"All the burning must have been from learning how to use this world’s odd range, or perhaps the ingredients cooked far faster than those on Whinhlem."
0,The strange atmosphere might have affected the heat of the flame.
0,There were many possibilities.
0,"Eydis had never cooked, so she wouldn’t know."
0,"She was confident that if Rynn had a range or stove or oven from her world, she would have been able to create perfect bread on the first attempt."
0,"If the burnt sections were ignored, the bread could be preserved and used to feed them for some time."
0,“Are you not satisfied with the bread?”
0,Rynn shook her head once more.
0,“It tastes bad.”
0,“Of course.
0,"Why did I not realize it before,” Eydis spoke under her breath."
0,Forrest Elves were originally scavengers that relied on their senses to determine the safety and quality of food.
0,They had an extraordinary sense of taste.
0,Eydis recalled hearing that the head chef and chef staff of the palace were all Forest Elves.
0,Rynn prepared and brought all the meals when she was Austin’s slave.
0,"If the bread contained any burnt or overcooked parts, the flavor would bitter."
0,"If the combinations of spices were modified even slightly, the resulting flavor would drastically change for a Forrest Elf’s tongue."
0,The bread she made was not poor.
0,It just didn’t stand up to Forrest Elf scrutiny.
0,“Can you dry the rest of this bread?
0,We can live off of it for a time.
0,I will eat the more burnt sections.
0,It is better we not let food go to waste.
0,Restocking provisions might be difficult.” 
0,"Rynn might have been used to the infinitely abundant provisions of the palace and so did not think anything wrong with making so much bread that she did not intend to eat, but here on Earth nothing should be wasted."
0,Rynn nodded and began drawing the moisture from the bread.
1,Eydis walked back into the hall and to the closet.
0,She opened the door to the cellar and took a deep breath.
0,Only a single night passed since she last fed on the princess.
0,"After all that abuse, she doubted the princess would be a threat, but after what happened to Rynn, she could not take any chances."
0,She erected a wind magic barrier around her body and walked down the steps into the darkness.
0,The princess’s attack had broken the light orb in the ceiling by hitting the wall near the switch that lit it.
0,The only light came from the faint orange glow of the furnace that Rynn had likely kept stoked.
0,The princess lay in her chains on a blanket that was not there before.
0,The blood on the floor from Eydis’ abuse of the princess had been cleaned.
0,A towel only large enough to cover her midsection lay atop her.
0,She could smell the fain fragrance of the human soap.
0,Rynn had also bathed the princess right here in the cellar.
0,"There was the possibility that the princess had soiled herself, and that was the reason Rynn washed her, but another thought crept into Eydis’s mind."
0,Rynn was a citizen of the Amelian Empire who worked in the palace.
0,She knew who Eydis kept captive.
0,"She was not willing to go against Eydis’s wishes, but at the same time, she still respected the rightful heir of the Amelian Empire."
0,"While avoiding crossing any line that would anger Eydis, she did her best to care for the princess."
0,"Rynn was far too kind, and her kindness caused a small portion of guilt to twist in Eydis’s chest."
0,"But still, Eydis could not risk becoming lax on her treatment of her prisoner, not after what the princess did to Rynn."
0,She needed to make sure the princess’s ven stayed well below usable levels.
0,Eydis lifted the princess to bring her forehead close to measure her ven and blood levels.
0,"She could have touched any location on the princess’s body to read her vitals, but the forehead was special."
0,It was one of a number of ven wellpoints on the body and was specifically attributed to the soul.
0,"Socially, touching foreheads was a sign of intimacy and care."
0,"Medicinally, contact between the wellpoints in the forehead made the reading of vitality easier and far more accurate."
0,"If Eydis wanted to weaken the princess enough to prevent magic but not weak enough to endanger her life, she needed to know precisely how much ven she could safely drain."
0,A dull gaze stared at Eydis through the thin slits of the princess’s nearly closed eyelids.
0,"Eydis dropped the princess in surprise, but there was no reaction when the princess’s shoulder and head hit the hard floor."
0,"The princess was not asleep as Eydis had thought, but at the same time she was languid, seemingly lifeless."
0,Either her mind was absent or she had given up.
0,"Eydis was still wary of the princess, but the princess could do nothing in her current state."
0,Their foreheads pressed together again.
0,"Blood levels were rather low due to the events of the previous day, but they were not low enough to be life-threatening."
0,A little feeding would not endanger the princess.
0,Ven levels were only slightly above the critical point.
0,"Eydis had nearly drained the princess dry in her anger, so this much was expected."
0,"The amount that could be drawn this time was small, but Eydis would have to make do."
0,Rynn’s recovery might end up taking longer than expected.
0,"Eydis bit into the princess’s shoulder, tearing an opening in the skin."
0,She placed her mouth on the wound and began sucking the slowly seeping blood.
0,"A euphoric high radiated from her stomach, and Eydis could feel the small effects the blood had on her body."
0,"With how much she was feeding now, the estimated one year or so for completion would only take a minute fraction of a year."
0,This realization pleased Eydis.
0,She wanted to be rid of the princess as soon as possible.
0,"When Eydis about finished feeding, the pleasant feeling in her stomach changed."
0,It developed into nausea and then acute pain.
0,Her chest tightened and her heartbeat grew erratic.
0,Eydis pushed the princess away and stumbled back.
0,In the slits of the princess’s eyes animosity stared back.
0,Eydis began sweating profusely.
0,"She grabbed her chest and writhed on the ground, crying out in pain."
0,Life magic surged through her body to try and find what the princess had done.
0,"Her heart felt close to bursting, and in each prolonged absence of a beat Eydis felt herself slip closer into darkness."
0,"Each painful beat could be her last, and if she did nothing, death alone awaited her."
0,"The patter of small, panicked feet flew down the steps."
0,“Stay back!”
0,"Eydis could not risk Rynn getting hurt again, and in her writhing and convulsions, she feared that she might injure the frail girl if Rynn tried to help."
0,"Her leg spasmed, kicking the lower shelf along the wall."
0,"The wood shattered in a spray of splinters, sending a cascade of glass jars to the ground, but the shelf was low enough that only a few shattered upon impact with the cement floor."
0,The powerful and erratic palpitations continued.
0,Eydis vomited the blood she had not finished absorbing.
0,She struggled against the life magic of one who was far superior even in a weakened state.
0,Eydis’s body grew cold.
0,Breathing became difficult.
0,Her body ran out of energy to writhe.
0,"She lay motionless on the floor, fighting for her life with only her own life magic to save her."
0,Rynn stood back and watched in fright.
0,"Unable to bare the silence, she ran over to the princess and wrapped her arms around her."
0,“Please!
0,Stop this!
0,Don’t hurt her!”
0,"She begged and pleaded, but the princess did not respond."
0,Rynn dragged Eydis’s limp body to the princess.
0,"She pushed the two bodies together and embraced them, holding them as tight as she could."
0,"“I beg you, Eydis FeAmel… Please…She is not evil… She saved me… I can’t lose her… Please, don’t take her from me…”"
0,"Rynn’s pleading became incoherent cries, and her tears fell on the princess’s cheek."
0,The princess looked up at the young girl’s injured face and then closed her eyes.
0,"An arm raised and hit the side of the princess’s head, knocking the princess limp."
0,Eydis pushed away.
0,"Lying on her back, Eydis’s breathing slowly regulated."
0,"She was still sweating profusely, and her body grew feverish from ven exhaustion, but the palpitations ceased, and the pain subsided."
0,She stared at the ceiling and focused on her recovery.
0,The danger had passed.
0,Did I beat it?
0,Or…
0,"Eydis rolled her neck to look at the unconscious princess, but Rynn dove down and wrapped her arms around Eydis’s neck, crying in relief."
0,"Eydis let Rynn hold her, lacking the energy to stand and leave the cellar."
0,She had depleted the ven she drew from the princess in her struggle.
0,The blood she ingested had been vomited back up and was now useless.
0,"The princess won, again."
0,"Just as Eydis was careless the day before, she had been careless now."
0,"She set up defenses against wind magic but completely neglected the most deadly of magic available to the princess, life magic."
0,The princess was still fighting with all her strength.
0,"“Knock her out first, I guess…” Eydis moaned."
0,Rynn stripped and clung tight to Eydis to help her recover ven as fast as possible through contact.
1,"After an unknown amount of time, Eydis could move again."
0,"Using Rynn as a crutch, they walked back up the steps and to the tub to wash off the sweat, dust, food from the jars, and bloody vomit."
0,"“Sorry, Rynn."
0,Your recovery will have to wait another day.”
0,"Rynn shook her head as she scrubbed Eydis’s back, now covered in light scrapes from writhing on the rough cellar floor covered in shattered glass."
0,“Let it heal.”
0,“But the scar!” 
0,"Slender arms wrapped around Eydis, and Rynn’s cheek rested on Eydis’s shoulder."
0,“I’m fine.
0,It’s my trophy… for saving you…”
0,Eydis felt the cheek resting on her shoulder flex.
0,Was that a smile?
0,It couldn’t be.
0,She had never once seen Rynn smile.
0,"But, Forest Elves treated scars as badges of honor, and if the scar brought Rynn even the smallest feeling of joy that Eydis had yet been unable, she could not turn down the girl’s wishes."
0,"“We will let it heal, then.”"
0,"Chapter 3
“Kind Humans do exist.”
Eydis"
1,Eydis delayed her departure another three days to make certain she could safely regulate the princess’s ven recovery.
0,"To prevent further danger, Eydis used gloves she found to choke the princess unconscious before feeding."
0,She feared that continual blows to the head would cause complications that could not be fixed with life magic and might lead to death.
0,"Asphyxiation had its own dangers, but they were not as severe."
0,At least she assumed they weren’t.
0,Only time would tell.
0,"After donning the princess’s unwashed and damaged shirt and pants from her fight with Jethro’s men, Eydis made sure all the windows were closed, curtains were shut, and doors were locked."
0,"“I will be spending much of my time with the Humans of this world for now, but I will be back once or twice a day to check up on you.”"
0,"Rynn nodded, but her countenance fell."
0,She did not want Eydis to go.
0,Eydis embraced the small girl and ran her fingers through her wheat-colored hair that glistened with strands of silver.
0,“Do not worry.
0,I will never abandon you.
0,"We will be living in this human world from now on, and the humans I am meeting are accepting of our kind."
0,"Once I feel it safe, I will let you join me."
0,"If it does not work out, I will leave them, and we will find somewhere else in this world to live."
0,"Besides, the humans of this world must have investigated the fight."
0,"They might know the movements of Jethro’s men better than I, and that is information we must learn.”"
1,"After one last caress of Rynn’s cheek, Eydis tore open a portal in the air like a fissure through space that brought her to the river on the opposite side of the apartment where the princess’s man, Justin, lived."
0,She hid in the shrubbery to keep out of sight.
0,Eydis refrained from bathing and added self-inflicted cuts and bruises at different levels of healing to allude to the battle and a struggle during her escape or abuse during captivity.
0,"Now in a location with dirt, she rubbed some on her body and in her hair."
0,"Much of the snow had melted, but the weather remained rather wet, so to complete her mask, Eydis drenched parts of her clothes with river water."
0,She scanned the river path to watch for any travelers.
0,"A middle-aged jogger ran down the path exhaling large clouds of white breath every couple of steps, but it was otherwise deserted as it had been most days when Eydis observed the princess’s daily routine."
0,"After the Jogger continued far enough down the pathway, Eydis opened a portal and stepped into it, bringing her to the other side of the river."
0,"Justin would not return for another hour if he still adhered to his normal schedule, so Eydis sat beside a bush next to the gate to his apartment."
0,"Time passed, and the time Justin should have appeared passed with it."
0,"Eydis expected the sudden disappearance of the princess to cause changes in Justin’s hard-set routine, but she hoped he would arrive soon."
0,"The clothing Eydis wore was light and nowhere near sufficient to ward against the near freezing wind-chill, especially when wet."
0,She shivered and rubbed her arms and legs to work circulation back into them.
0,"If Justin took much longer, she would have to use life magic to warm her body."
0,She had been avoiding doing so because her cold and frail appearance would elicit a better reaction and hopefully mask any minute differences that Justin might notice between her and the princess.
0,The sun set over the city skyline.
0,Soon the grey clouds grew light purple ripples and then faded dark blue.
0,"The cold became unbearable, and Eydis began to wonder if Justin had even left his apartment at all."
0,The loss of the princess might have caused him greater shock than she thought.
0,"Justin had multiple women, so the loss of one should not have been so great a cause for concern."
0,"Then again, Austin was obsessed enough with Rynn to force the girl into slavery, and when Eydis freed her, he became far more violent with Wian, his other Forrest Elf slave."
0,"If Austin’s demeanor changed from the loss of one slave, then Justin might have also changed with the loss of the princess."
0,"She was confident that any human of this world would think the princess an exotic prize, and no doubt the princess was the favorite among Justin’s women with how often Eydis saw them together."
0,Disgust wormed in Eydis’s stomach.
0,Was she really to place herself in a similar situation to Austin’s slaves?
0,Even Justin’s name was too similar.
0,"At least the women seem happy with Justin, so it might not be so bad?"
0,"She did not know, and that minor assurance did not ease her disgust."
0,"She only knew how they acted in public, not in the privacy of their home."
0,Eydis searched her heart with earnest consideration to the thought that she did not actually have to meet up with the princess’s humans.
0,Their information not only on the aftermath of the battle with Jethro’s men but also on this world in general was invaluable--true.
0,And they were accepting of elves--also true.
0,"She would have to interact with the humans of this world now that she decided to live here, and this was the most beneficial time to do so."
0,"She wanted to leave and have nothing to do with them, but something inside of her was telling her to stay."
0,Intuition?
0,Doppelganger Instinct?
0,She didn’t know.
0,"Eydis’s unease increased as night set in, and she felt that she would have to catch Justin another time."
0,"The next day, Justin would leave later in the morning for work."
0,"With or without the princess, he should still attend to his employment, she hoped."
0,She could catch him then.
0,Or maybe not catch him at all.
0,"This could be fate telling her to abandon the idea, or at least to spend another night thinking it over and discussing options with Rynn."
0,Eydis stepped out onto the path.
0,She looked both ways to check for anyone who might see her teleport and noticed someone walking down the path with two white sacks in each hand.
0,The man with blond hair stood shorter than most.
0,She had seen his threadbare and tattered grey coat many times before.
0,Finally.
0,Eydis held her arm and walked slowly towards the figure.
0,His pace slowed and then stopped.
0,"Even from his distance, Eydis could see the man’s mouth agape and quivering."
0,"He dropped his bags and ran forward, nearly tripping once on the path."
0,"She prepared for a collision, but Justin slowed and embraced her lightly."
0,“Eydis.” Justin rested his face above Eydis’s left breast but quickly pulled himself off.
0,Eydis was grateful the embrace was short.
0,"In her disgust at a human male holding her so endearingly, she almost threw him off herself."
0,It took immense control not to.
0,He held her at arm’s length and scanned her with his eyes.
0,“Are you okay?
0,Are you injured?
0,What happened?
0,Were you involved in that mess outside town a week ago?”
0,"Sure enough, Justin made the connection with the disappearance of the princess and the fight with Jethro’s men."
0,She might be able to get some useful information from him after all.
0,That would be repayment enough to tolerate the embrace.
0,"Without waiting for a response from Eydis, Justin grabbed her hand and pulled her towards the gate."
0,"She immediately felt a powerful syphon of ven, far stronger than her High Elf slave back in the palace."
0,"Justin’s ven regeneration must have been astoundingly fast, odd for a human."
0,"Before Justin could pull Eydis too far, she stopped him and pointed down the path."
0,“Your bags.”
0,"Flustered, Justin ran down the path to retrieve them."
1,"Both white bags in one arm, he grasped Eydis’s hand and led her to the apartment."
0,Another man whom Eydis did not know lived in the apartment.
0,"He was similar in height to her, though a little shorter, with a rather austere aura about him, but that aura melted when he saw Eydis."
0,"“Eydis, are you alright?"
0,Where have you been all this time?”
0,Genuine concern leaked through his stern expression.
0,The princess lived in a small abode with two men.
0,"Justin was obviously her man, but then who was this?"
0,"Just as a man could have multiple women, a woman could have multiple men if she chose, but it was far more uncommon, at least on Whinhlem."
0,She could not make any guesses about this world.
0,"His reaction was not as endearing as Justin’s, so she doubted he was a second lover."
0,"Justin was clearly poor, comparing his abode to the other homes and buildings of the city, so this might simply be another resident who shared the home."
0,"Eydis did not know how much this man knew about the princess’s situation, so she did not know how to respond."
0,She did not even know his name.
0,"“I am fine now, but…” She left her statement hanging to allow the man to reason about whatever he imagined could fill the blank."
0,“We can talk after.
0,She’s turning purple.”
1,Justin pulled Eydis away and to a washroom similar to the one at the house she and Rynn used.
0,“Take a bath and warm up.
0,"We can talk after.” He paused for a moment, trying to work his panicked thoughts into words."
0,“I’m… I’m so glad you are back.
0,I was so scared that you might have been captured or killed.
0,I…”
0,Eydis placed her hand on Justin’s shoulder.
0,His concern was heartfelt.
0,He shook from the fear and relief that battled inside him.
0,There was no doubt that this man cared deeply for the princess.
0,A smile grew on Eydis’s face.
0,"The full nature of the relationship between the princess and Justin was still unknown, so Eydis wanted to test it."
0,"Using the meekest voice she could, she spoke to the trembling man."
0,“I am almost too weak to stand.
0,Can you help wash me?”
0,Justin’s reaction was unexpected.
0,He looked as Eydis’s slightly embarrassed yet pleading face with dumbstruck silence.
0,"He then glanced into the living room where the other man sat out of sight and then back at Eydis, almost worrying that the other man might have heard her request."
0,"Justin looked into Eydis’s eyes, and with a deep, silent breath, he nodded."
0,"“Yah, if you need me to.”"
0,"Justin’s reaction was innocent, but it was not the innocence of a virgin youth."
0,It was of a man uncomfortable with the request but willing to help.
0,"He was either unaccustomed to such intimacy and the request took him by surprise, or the request was not something the other man who lived here was supposed to hear."
0,She could think of two possibilities.
0,"Either the relationship between Justin and the princess was not sexual, or it was and needed to be kept secret from the other man for whatever reason."
0,Eydis hoped with all her soul it was the former.
0,"“No, sorry."
0,I think I will be fine.
0,Can you bring me new clothes?”
0,Justin hurried down the hall and turned to the first door on the left.
0,Eydis now knew the location of her room.
0,"Justin returned with a shirt, soft and fuzzy pants, and what looked like a set of pastel green undergarments not unlike the damaged ones the princes had worn but were now unusable after the fight."
0,"After thanking him, she entered the bathroom and closed the door."
1,“Haaaaaa…”
0,"Eydis leaned on the counter and breathed a tense sigh, confident that the loud ventilation fan would mask any noise she made."
0,The heart in Eydis’s chest pounded with adrenaline.
0,"So far, her infiltration worked."
0,"She knew little about the princess’s private life, practically nothing, but if she hung on her absence and her capture as an excuse, she should avoid any major pitfalls."
0,She undressed and found how to get the faucet of the tub to work.
0,"It was different than the one at Rynn’s home, but the mechanisms were similar enough."
0,"Taking one bottle and soap at a time, she smelled them to match the fragrances to the two men who lived in this apartment."
0,Those on the left side of the tub matched Justin while those on the right matched the unnamed man.
0,"There was no other set for the princess, so either the princess used one of the men’s or none at all."
0,Eydis recalled the princess’s scent during her first feeding after the battle with Jethro’s men.
0,"The original smell of soap on the princess had faded from that day, erased by the scent of the soap Rynn used to wash her, but she felt there was a match, unmistakably Justin’s."
0,Eydis kept the water in the tub shallow with the faucet continually running.
0,She rinsed off the dirt and scrubbed the sweat and oils from her body.
0,She then turned off the faucet and let the water drain before standing to air dry.
0,The undergarments the princess used were peculiar.
0,"The bottom was thin, covered little, and insufficient to hide her tail."
0,The breast supports were the most peculiar part.
0,"Eydis’s chest, and thus the princess’s chest, was not large enough to need supportive undergarments, but if this was common for the humans of this world, and if the princess wore such things regularly, then she would have to wear it."
0,She slipped her arms through the straps and found that the cups fit perfectly.
0,"The back had to have some method to fasten, but Eydis could not find it."
0,She removed the supports and inspected them.
0,There were three tiny metal hooks that matched tiny flat loops on the other end.
0,She placed the supports back on and struggled to get the hooks into the loops.
0,"She quickly grew frustrated with her inability to fasten it correctly, so she removed the supports and decided to go without."
0,She could use the excuse that they were agitating her injuries.
0,The pants sent shivers up her back from the fabric’s soft and strangely pleasant texture against her skin as she slid them up her legs.
1,"Once dressed, she left the bathroom and returned to the living room."
0,Justin met her with a small amount of food prepared.
0,“I thought you might be hungry.
0,I didn’t know if you had anything to eat.”
0,Eydis was grateful for Justin’s thoughtfulness.
0,"Aside from feeding on the princess, she refrained from eating for two days as part of her preparation."
0,"Indeed, she was rather hungry."
0,"The portion Justin provided was small and did not appear enough to satisfy her, but she knew the food of this world was heavy and filling, and Justin would also be aware of how much the princess regularly ate."
0,"She grabbed the knife and fork and cut into what looked like a fried egg folded over an orange cheese, placing a piece of it into her mouth with the tip of the knife."
0,"It did not taste anywhere near as good as Rynn’s flatbread, but her stomach rejoiced."
0,"“So, what happened to you?"
0,You suddenly disappeared before the self-defense class.
0,Did the assassin find you?”
0,The other man looked surprised and then irritated.
0,Eydis finished eating.
0,She did not know the meaning of the word assassin but reasoned that Justin was talking about Jethro.
0,"“The assassin, his name is Jethro."
0,Yes… his men found me.”
0,The other man stood from the couch and paced in irritation.
0,“How long have you known that an assassin was after Eydis?”
0,Justin looked sheepishly back at the man.
0,"“Sorry, Sean."
0,I didn’t want to worry you.”
0,“Worry?” The man named Sean rummaged one hand through his hair.
0,“This goes beyond worrying.
0,"What happened outside the city the day you disappeared, was that part of this?”"
0,Eydis nodded.
0,“They teleported me there.
0,They were using that house as a base.
0,I had no choice but to fight back.
0,"I killed most of them, but I was captured…”"
0,“Then you were the one who killed all those people?” 
0,Eydis buried her face in her hands.
0,“Yes.
0,I had no choice.
0,I had to fight.”
0,“Then…” Justin paused for a moment before coming to a shocking realization that drained the blood from his face.
0,"“The people who are after you, the one who tried to assassinate you, they are humans from your world?”"
0,"“We are at war in my world, my Empire and the humans of Tolmyur.” "
0,"“Your caution and fear when you arrived, all your anxiety, everything.” "
0,Justin pulled Eydis into an embrace.
0,“I’m so sorry I never realized.
0,"All this time, you were not only in a strange world, but you were surrounded by people who are the same as your enemies."
0,I’m so sorry.”
0,Eydis wanted to push Justin away but stopped herself and let him try to comfort her.
0,She reluctantly wrapped her arms around him and rested her chin on his shoulder.
0,“It is fine.
0,Humans of this world are different.
0,We are not enemies.”
0,Sean sat back down on the couch.
0,“Are those assassins still after you?”
0,Eydis separated from Justin and nodded.
0,“Yes.
0,There are more in the city.
0,"They had a portal at the house I burnt down, but they can easily move it.”"
0,“What are the chances that they will come here and attack us or anyone else?” Sean asked.
0,"“I am sure they have already killed many people in the city, but I do not think they know I live here."
0,They only knew of the school.”
0,Sean shook his head in frustration.
0,“What a mess you have gotten us into…”
0,Justin balled his fists and glared back at Sean.
0,“Can you not accuse her the moment she gets back from nearly being killed!?”
0,“I was not talking about Eydis.
0,I was talking about you!”
0,Both Justin and Sean stood.
0,“That doesn’t matter!
0,Eydis will still feel like it’s her fault if you say it like that!
0,You should know that!
0,Can you at least show some concern?”
0,“I am only saying this because I am concerned!
0,"If there are dangerous people coming into the city that are not afraid to take lives, we need to go to the police and explain everything!”"
0,“Then what will happen to Eydis?!
0,She’s already refused to contact the police many times!
0,What happens if they take her away and start running experiments on her or something?
0,"She’s not human, you know!”"
0,"Eydis sat back, mildly entertained by the ensuing spectacle."
0,“What kind of sci-fi fantasy are you living in?
0,I doubt experimenting on her will even be considered.
0,We can keep Eydis’s identity secret and still tell the authorities that there are more dangerous people out there.
0,And what about us?
0,"Now that they know Eydis works at the university, I’m sure it will not take them long to find out she is connected to us, or Sammy, or anyone else."
0,"If anything, we need to talk with everyone who knows the truth about Eydis and decide what to do from here."
0,"However, with or without your and Eydis’s permission, I will be contacting the police,” Sean asserted."
0,"“Fine, but wait until after we talk with everyone before deciding what to tell them.” Justin knelt next to Eydis and grabbed her hand."
0,“We don’t blame you for any of this.
0,I knew what I was getting into when I decided to take you in.
0,"You’ve already been through a lot, so please rest for now."
0,I’ll call everyone to let them know you are back.”
0,"“Yes, I am tired."
0,Thank you.” Eydis walked into the hall.
0,"“I am going to heal myself, so do not come in.”"
0,The two men nodded.
1,"The princess’s scent enveloped the bedroom, and entering brought with it an incredible urge to feed."
0,"Much to Eydis’s surprise, the room itself was rather plain."
0,There were no decorations or embellishments.
0,None of the Amelian regal flair could be found.
0,"The bed was smaller than the ones in both Jethro’s base on the outskirts of the city and the house she and Rynn were using, but at least it was long enough to lie comfortably across."
0,"A desk sat in the corner, and a single dresser stood next to the closet."
0,"The top drawer contained the princess’s undergarments, but the remaining drawers held Justin’s clothes."
0,The closet was divided between Justin and Eydis’s clothes as well.
0,The two shared the room.
0,Was their relationship sexual?
0,That could not be right.
0,"Although Justin’s scent was present, it was faint."
0,He spent little time in the room.
0,"The smell could just be from the clothing or lounging in the room, but she had to make sure."
0,Eydis smelled the bed.
0,"It was masked by the princess’s stronger scent, making her salivate, but Justin’s scent was far more present there than elsewhere in the room."
0,"If Justin only spent brief moments in the room and his scent fell strongest on the bed, then Eydis reasoned that there could be only one possibility."
0,Their relationship was sexual.
0,This brought about a terrifying realization.
0,"“I have never been with a man,” Eydis spoke in frantic whispers."
0,“He would know immediately that I was not the princess if we… 
0,"Then to keep him from finding out, I would first have to…” "
0,Eydis held her stomach and covered her mouth to fight back the nausea from the prospect of not only lying with a human male but also needing to break her own hymen beforehand.
1,"Unable to bear the thought, she opened a portal and stepped through to a more familiar bedroom using her memorized formula."
0,Rynn sat lonely on the bed.
0,Seeing her cleansed Eydis’s troubled mind.
0,"Rynn’s eyes lit up with excitement, showing even more emotion."
0,Eydis could not have been happier.
0,She smiled at the girl and spread her arms.
0,“See?
0,I told you I would be back.
0,"Although, I was not planning on returning so soon, but I could not stop myself.”"
0,Rynn hopped off the bed and hugged Eydis.
0,Her hands felt the soft pants and immediately grew fascinated with them.
0,"“They are quite nice,” Eydis boasted."
0,“I cannot believe the princess has been lounging in these all this time.
0,Anyone in our world would pay a fortune.
0,They certainly outclass those silk skirts.”
0,“Then…” 
0,"“Yes, I made it in, but the real test will start soon."
0,"The other resident of the home is not happy that dangerous people are after me, and he is going to involve everyone who knows about the princess’s true identity.” "
0,"Eydis removed her clothes and sat on the bed to finally heal her self-inflicted injuries, ending their incessant itch from the scabbing."
0,“Will you be caught?” Rynn sat beside and placed her hands on Eydis’s shoulders to help her recover ven.
0,“I do not think so.
0,"If the man closest to the princess did not notice, then no one else should."
0,"But, I must be careful."
0,I cannot assume I or they know anything.
0,Playing a fresh slate is the best choice.”
0,“That is dangerous.” 
0,"“It is, but if I can build new connections and information, then I can rely on that and ignore anything the princess did or knew in the past."
0,"Everything else, I will avoid.”"
0,"Eydis finished healing and lay back across the bed, pulling Rynn on top of her."
0,She held the girl close and ran her fingers through her hair.
0,“I will not be able to sleep with you tonight.
0,Will you be fine on your own?”
0,Rynn gave a slow nod and buried her face in Eydis’s chest.
0,"“I will hold you for a bit longer, but I will need to go back soon.”"
0,Eydis continued holding Rynn until Rynn became drowsy.
0,"She then laid Rynn on the bed, pulled the blankets over her, and touched foreheads."
0,"Despite Rynn’s short stature and childlike demeanor, she was a young woman and capable on her own, but when she was with Eydis, her childish side came out and stirred the mothering instincts in Eydis."
0,"Rynn wanted to be spoiled, and Eydis would happily give the world to her if possible."
0,"After one last glance at the girl, she grabbed her clothes and opened the rift back to her room in Justin’s apartment."
1,"“Sammy, let her rest.”"
0,“Shut it.
0,You can’t expect me not to see her now that she’s back.
0,The light is still on.
0,She hasn’t gone to sleep yet.”
0,The handle turned.
0,Eydis dropped her clothes and quickly erased the portal behind her.
0,"When the door opened, the shortest of Justin’s women poked her head inside."
0,"At one glance, she turned back to the man behind her and pushed him away."
0,“She’s not decent.
0,Go.” She then slipped inside and quickly closed the door behind her.
0,“S…Sammy?” Eydis tried to hold in her panic.
0,"If she had been a moment too late or decided to stay with Rynn longer, they would have found out that she had been elsewhere."
0,"Tears welled in Sammy’s eyes, and she rushed over to embrace Eydis."
0,"Her arms wrapped snugly around Eydis’s back and pulled her in, almost bending Eydis over her."
0,"The woman was only half a head taller than Rynn, rather short for a human, but her bone structure was not thick enough to be a Dwarf."
0,"After crying for a moment, Sammy pulled herself off and wiped her cheeks and the tears she left running down Eydis’s stomach."
0,“Sorry for barging in.
0,I’ll let you get dressed.”
0,"Eydis grabbed the soft pants and stepped into them, feeling that alone sufficient."
0,"Sammy only shook her head, wiping more tears."
0,“I’ll let it pass this time.”
0,Was simple attire improper even in one’s own home?
0,"Eydis look down at her chest and arms, wondering if there was something wrong with exposing her upper body, but then shook her head feeling that was foolish."
0,"“I know, I know."
0,"Men have breasts too, so it’s no big deal."
0,"This is what, the fifth time we’ve had this discussion?” Sammy chuckled, but it was a bit forced."
0,"“I’m not going to ask you to explain what happened, because I’m sure that you will have to tell everyone all over again when we meet with Dr. Shuman tomorrow."
0,I… I just couldn’t wait to see you.
0,You suddenly disappeared.
0,And then that bloody fight outside town?
0,I’ve been a nervous wreck all week.
0,"I kept fearing the worst, that you would never come back."
0,I kept telling myself you were still alive.
0,I just…”
0,"Tears fell again, and Sammy tried futilely to wipe them away."
0,Eydis knelt and pulled Sammy into another embrace.
0,"She found herself running her fingers through Sammy’s shoulder length, wavy brown hair out of habit."
0,She could not find it in herself to hate this girl.
0,"It may have just been their size, but something about Sammy reminded her of Rynn."
0,“I am fine.
0,Everything is okay.”
0,Sammy fought to regain composure and soon stopped crying.
0,“Sorry.
0,I’m sure you had a hard enough time without coming back to me sobbing all over you.” 
0,"After a deep breath, she separated and flashed a radiant smile on her tear-drenched face."
0,“I’m glad that you are back.”
0,A small tinge of guilt pricked at Eydis’s heart.
0,"This girl was such a loving friend to the princess, and Eydis expected to encounter such reactions and had steeled herself against it, but Sammy’s free-flowing emotions breached the wall, even if only a little."
0,"“I completely understand if you would prefer to just rest on your own, so you can turn me down if you want, but if it’s alright, can I stay here tonight with you?"
0,"Justin won’t complain since you are still up, so…”"
0,A small chuckle escaped Eydis’s lips.
0,Sammy was just like Rynn.
0,This human was alright.
0,"“Yes, you can stay tonight.”"
0,Sammy bounded into Eydis and gave her a tight hug.
0,“Thank you!
0,"Oh, Sorry!"
0,"Justin said you were hurt, and I just…”"
0,Eydis laughed lightly as Sammy jumped away and waved her hands apologetically.
0,"Chapter 4
“Those who Know”
Eydis"
1,The sweet metallic taste swirled in Eydis’s mouth and trickled down the back of her throat.
0,"She did not want to swallow, choosing to let it pool in her mouth to savor the flavor."
0,The amount of blood she could safely draw from the princess slowly decreased as the princess’s body was unable to replenish it at the rate Eydis fed.
0,This caused a problem because ven was not directly associated with blood levels even if much of it resided in blood.
0,"In order to keep the princess’s ven low enough that she was not a threat, Eydis had to drink a certain amount of blood."
0,"This time was an experiment to see if Eydis could separate the draw of ven from the draw of blood as she fed, but she was unsuccessful."
0,"By keeping the princess’s blood levels low enough, she could leave the princess too anemic to use magic even if the princess had the ven to do so, but that created far greater health risks than critically low ven alone."
0,"Forcing herself to hold back and heal the wound, Eydis swallowed the accumulated blood in her mouth and licked her lips."
0,"Her body begged for more, but that was just not possible."
0,She laid the princess back down on the blanket and walked up the stairs to say goodbye to Rynn.
0,"Rynn wanted her to stay longer, but her time was limited."
0,She could not leave the humans waiting.
1,She rested her forehead against Rynn’s for a short farewell and opened the portal back to the bathroom of Justin’s apartment.
0,"She then flushed the toilet, washed her hands and mouth, and opened the door."
0,"In the living room, Justin, Sammy, and Sean waited by the front door."
0,“Thank you for waiting.”
0,"The previous evening, Justin contacted everyone who knew about the princess’s true identity using this world’s peculiar communication device and arranged a meeting at an office belonging to someone named Dr. Shuman."
0,"Instead of using the river path and catching the bus like Eydis had seen Justin and the princess do almost every day, they turned right and walked to the front of the complex to a paved lot full of metal carriages."
0,"They all entered the one belonging to Sean with him driving, Justin in the front passenger seat, and Sammy next to Eydis in the back seat at Sammy’s request."
0,Eydis fought to hold in her amazement as the vehicle roared to life and moved on its own as if powered by some strange magic.
0,It rolled out of the lot onto the road and picked up speed.
0,"The homes of the residential district flew by the windows, as did other vehicles and people."
0,"Once they reached the main street and crossed the river, Sean took a different route from the bus that the princess usually rode."
0,"Using back roads, he avoided heavier traffic and drove them to the east side of the campus to more large, paved lots."
0,"The group walked across campus to a structure Eydis knew well, having stood on its roof to monitor the princess because it was the tallest building on campus."
0,They entered the building and then an extremely small room behind a metal door.
0,"Again, Eydis forced herself to hold in her surprise at the sudden increase in gravity and the short arrival at the top of the building."
0,"The princess was used to these strange technologies and sensations, so Eydis had to feign familiarity."
1,"Justin knocked on one of the doors down the long hallway, and it immediately flung open."
0,"Two women stood in the doorframe, Chloe and Miriam, although Eydis was not sure who was who."
0,They both pushed Justin and Sammy away and embraced Eydis.
0,“I was so worried about you.”
0,“I’m so glad you are safe.” 
0,“Let’s continue this inside.
0,"We have a lot to talk about.” Sean tried to coax Miriam and Chloe inside, but Sammy pushed him through the door."
0,"“Give them a moment, would you?”"
0,Eydis wrapped her arms around the two girls and walked them to the room.
0,"“I am happy to see you again, but Sean is right.”"
0,"The girl with long, orange hair let go but the girl with short brown hair clung to Eydis’s arm as they walked inside."
1,Justin closed the door behind them and turned the latch on the handle.
0,The aged professor sat near his desk in a black leather chair.
0,"He appeared relieved to see her, but that relief masked a lot of worry."
0,Everyone told Eydis to take the only remaining chair in the room.
0,She sat down and took a deep breath.
0,This room was filled with everyone most familiar with the princess.
0,They knew her true origins.
0,"If there ever was a time she would make a mistake, it would be now."
0,She had a transmission formula ready in the event that she made a mistake and needed to make a quick escape.
0,Do not assume anything.
0,Let them control the conversation.
0,Only talk about events after the disappearance of the princess.
0,Eydis reminded herself of her plan and looked forward at the chinstrap-bearded man who would conduct the meeting.
0,"Like Sean, he had the austere air of a rigorous scholar about him, but his first words surprised Eydis."
0,"“I am happy you are back safe, Eydis."
0,I’ve been worried.” A simple smile spread on Dr. Shuman’s face.
0,"“Sorry to worry you,” were the only words Eydis could think to say."
0,She bowed her head lightly at the man who could be seen as the senior of all those present and crossed her ankles out of respect.
0,"“No, no."
0,You had no control over what happened.
0,Justin told me over the phone that you were captured and managed to escape.
0,"You said there was little chance that the assassin could come to our world, but it seems we were all gravely mistaken."
0,"Now, people in the city have died, and I am part to blame for not warning the authorities ahead of time.” Dr. Shuman grimaced apologetically at Sean, who nodded sternly back."
0,"“But you did contact the police immediately when Eydis went missing,” Sammy cut in."
0,"“Only to give a missing person’s report,” Sean chided."
0,“The most you all did when questioned was explain where you last saw her.
0,Not one of you mentioned the people who were after her.”
0,"“Neither did you,” Sammy retorted."
0,“I did not know anyone was after her until yesterday.”
0,“You never told him?” Sammy looked at Justin dumbfounded.
0,“I would have thought after Sean learned who Eydis was that the assassin would be the first thing you told him.”
0,"“Sean would have called the police right then and there,” Justin said in his defense."
0,"“We are in this position because no one called the police in the first place,” Sean rebuked."
0,"The two other girls stood silent as finger pointing bounced back and forth between Justin, Sean, and Sammy."
0,Dr. Shuman waved his hand to break up the argument.
0,“There is nothing we can do about what has passed.
0,We are here to discuss how to move forward.
0,"Eydis, can you tell us what happened.”"
0,Eydis took another deep breath.
0,Justin placed his hand on her shoulder and gave a reassuring smile.
0,"“While Justin was setting up the class, I went to change."
0,I noticed the use of spatial magic but was too slow to defend myself.
0,They teleported me outside the city to the field behind the house you probably know about…”
0,"Eydis recounted the events of the battle with her in the position of the princess and included her own fights with the Dwarf commander, Mordok, and the human fire mage."
0,"She also explained that Jethro’s men brought a monster with them, and because she could not let such a dangerous monster remain in the city, she could not run and leave the monster behind."
0,"Each time she called the Lurr a monster, a faint pain pricked her heart, but she continued claiming as such because those were the princess’s own words."
0,Any clues about what a Lurr was might lead them to noticing something about her.
0,She continued the story with the death of the monster.
0,"In the process of using a terrible magic to kill it, she used too much ven and collapsed from ven exhaustion."
0,"When she came to, she was captured and bound with chains resistant to magic."
0,She stayed in captivity waiting for Jethro to open another portal because they could not open one from this world.
0,"When the portal opened, her guard’s watch became lax."
0,"She decapitated him with wind magic, took the key, freed herself, and teleported away."
0,“…and then I ran into Justin on the river after teleporting back.
0,I do not know how many came through the portal after or how many more are in the city.”
0,"“The police tried to censor much of the footage of the scene, but it is going viral.” Sammy removed the small, rectangular communication device from her pocket."
0,She showed Eydis an aerial picture of the field the morning after the battle.
0,"The large patch of ice from Mordok’s war hammer was visible, as was the crater from the fire mage’s suicidal explosion."
0,Smaller craters from the Lurr Giant peppered the field.
0,The most prominent part of the scene was the long scar along the ground and the blood and gore of the Lurr that dyed the field behind it.
0,"Eydis could never hope to achieve such magic in her current state, but as she fed on the princess, she also felt her ven capacity increasing to match."
0,Her strength in magic should also follow.
0,"“Where did they hold you,” Sean asked."
0,“We might be able to send the police there.”
0,Eydis shook her head.
0,“I do not know.
0,I was kept inside a building.”
0,“What about their descriptions?” 
0,"Again, Eydis shook her head."
0,“The one who watched me was the one I killed.
0,I did not see the others.”
0,"“Then all we know is that there are more people out there,” Sean grumbled to himself and leaned against the wall behind him."
0,“The biggest issue is what to tell the police about where they came from or how they are getting here.”
0,"“Well, Eydis is a refugee, and there are a lot of wars going on all over Asia, the Middle East."
0,"You know, terrorists and the like,” the brown-haired girl replied."
0,“That is where most of the refugees are coming from.
0,We could just tell the police that they are terrorists who slipped in with the refugees.”
0,“That’s a terrible idea!” The orange haired girl’s shout surprised everyone.
0,"“With how much abuse and bad press the refugees are already receiving right now, suggesting that terrorists have actually made it in with them would only add fuel to the fire, especially because this is a sanctuary city."
0,They are just trying to escape and live a better life here.”
0,“It’s not like I am saying we make it public or anything.
0,We’ll only tell the police.
0,We can add your concern so they know not to make it a public issue.”
0,“I still don’t like it.
0,It’s a lie that could hurt innocent people.”
0,"The brown-haired girl sighed, and the other did not argue further."
0,"“We can go with that for now, but what about Eydis’s connection to the terrorists,” Dr. Shuman asked."
0,“What reason would they have for targeting her?
0,"It can’t be information on them, because they would then want to know what that information is."
0,It’ll only add fabrication to fabrication.”
0,“Why not be more truthful here?” Justin piped in.
0,Everyone looked at him with a mix of confusion and doubt.
0,“I’m not saying that we tell them Eydis is an elf from another world.
0,"What we can say is that she is a daughter of someone that was in open opposition to them, possibly part of a family that fought against the terrorist’s rise to power or the former rulers that were overthrown by the terrorists."
0,"They executed her family, but she was able to escape and join refugees fleeing the country, so a small faction is chasing her."
0,This would be more believable because the terrorists have been publicly executing foreigners.
0,We can tell them that the terrorists are not radicals who attack indiscriminately but instead are actively searching for Eydis.”
0,“Wow. That is actually a surprisingly good idea.” 
0,"Once Sammy gave her approval, everyone else followed."
0,"“That takes care of the police side of things, but what about us,” Sean asked."
0,“Eydis said that they know she is associated with the university.
0,We should tell the police that as well.
0,"In any case, there is a chance that the assassins will come after us.”"
0,The room grew silent until the orange haired girl spoke.
0,“What about the students of Eydis’s self-defense class?
0,They are not involved with any of this.”
0,“I will stop teaching.” 
0,"Eydis never received martial training, so she would not be able to continue."
0,"“That’s probably the best choice,” the brown-haired girl agreed."
0,An idea jumped into Eydis’s head.
0,"While she had accepted Sammy to some degree, she still disliked the number of women around Justin."
0,"It made her feel less important, despite her own general disdain for him."
0,"If she could remove the other two here, her risk of becoming discovered as a fake would also decrease."
0,"Killing them was out of the question, for now, but making them leave of their own will could be possible."
0,"“I am glad you worry about my students, but what about you?"
0,Sean is right.
0,Jethro’s men know I am here now.
0,They know I come to this school.
0,You saw the field.
0,That is what a fight in my world is like.
0,You all live in this peaceful city.
0,"I taught you how to fight, but none of you truly know how to fight."
0,"If they find you, you will be lucky to be killed."
0,They might choose to capture you.”
0,Images of Rynn severely beaten flashed in Eydis’s mind.
0,“They are filthy people!
0,You will beg for death before they are done!”
0,Eydis’s outburst stunned all in the room.
0,"She was confident that Sammy would not shy away at this warning, but the orange haired girl looked meek."
0,The brown-haired girl was another matter.
0,She appeared the unshaken type.
0,"Still, Eydis directed her ending statement to her."
0,“You should forget about me.
0,You are safer that way.”
0,Tears formed in the corners of the orange haired girl’s eyes.
0,Perfect.
0,She will run.
0,"The brown-haired girl laughed, stunning Eydis in return."
0,“You haven’t learned.
0,First was your announcement in your class to try to get your students to stop your meditation.
0,Then in the magic lessons you tried to scare us away from continuing magic.
0,"Now that real danger arrives, you try to scare us away with death and rape warnings?”"
0,"The girl placed her hand on the corner of the back of Eydis’s chair, turned the chair to face her, and leaned her face in close."
0,“My grandmother prophesied that I would meet you and Justin.
0,She cried death and destruction.
0,I told you that already.
0,"All her other predictions came true, so this one was bound to as well no matter how absurd it sounded."
0,"If I was not prepared to encounter the danger in her prophecy, I never would have moved here and enrolled in this school."
0,Stop trying to scare us away.
0,"I know you are concerned, but we are just as concerned about you."
0,"Right, Chloe?”"
0,Chloe wiped her eyes and nodded.
0,“We are your friends.
0,"If you are worried about us, that we cannot fight, then teach us how to fight!” Chloe clenched her hands into tight fists and took a practiced stance as if ready to fight the moment Eydis gave the word."
0,“That’s what I am talking about!
0,"Because of where I live and campus rules, I couldn’t bring any of my guns with me, so if I could learn to fight with magic, that would help us defend ourselves.”"
0,“You own guns?” Chloe asked in amazement.
0,“A few.” Miriam smirked.
0,"The identities of the two girls were now revealed, but Eydis was too shocked to feel any relief."
0,Her plan failed spectacularly.
0,"She stared blankly at Miriam who had her arm around Chloe’s shoulders, smiling."
0,"They were now even more eager to remain associated, not less."
0,"“We should include Sean, too,” Sammy said."
0,"“Sean, hold out your hand with your palm up.” Sean obeyed, and Sammy held her hand above his."
0,“Feel anything?”
0,“No. What am I supposed to feel?”
0,Eydis recovered from her shock and watched in confusion.
0,“Chloe next.”
0,Chloe then held her hand over Sean’s just as Sammy had.
0,"“Nothing,” Sean repeated."
0,"Miriam went next, and again Sean denied any feeling."
0,"“You’re next, Eydis.”"
0,Affinity assessment!
0,Eydis was relieved she caught on before problems could arise from her lack of understanding.
0,She held out her hand and tried wind ven.
0,“Nothing.”
0,"“Then not wind,” Eydis said."
0,“What is this about?” Sean looked puzzled.
0,“We are trying to find out what element you have an affinity for.
0,"I am water, Chloe is fire, Miriam is earth, and Justin is time, but we cannot use him to check if you have an affinity because he cannot even feel his own ven let alone control it.”"
0,Eydis’s breath froze in her throat.
0,That human had a time affinity.
0,How was that possible?
0,"An incredible ven regeneration rate was rare enough, but he was also a time mage?"
0,Was that why the princess was so attached to him?
0,Was that how he attracted so many women?
0,"A person with an affinity that was rare for magically adept species let alone those who were not, like humans, would naturally attract mates that desired their offspring to have that rare blood."
0,The number of women surrounding Justin began to make sense.
0,They sought after his bloodline.
0,"“Eydis, what about life and spatial?”"
0,Eydis extended her hand.
0,No response.
0,"“Unless you have time or gravity, that means you have no affinities,” Sammy explained."
0,“That’s fine with me.
0,I didn’t plan on learning magic.”
0,"“What about Dr. Shuman,” Chloe asked."
0,“No need to include me in this.
0,I’m far too old for this kind of thing.”
0,Sammy poked Sean in the chest.
0,"“Even if you do not have an affinity, you should join us for our magic lessons instead of staying cooped up in your apartment reading."
0,"If you do encounter one of the assassins, knowing what they can do might save your life.”"
0,"“I’ve been thinking,” Justin cut in, “Why don’t we just leave the city?"
0,"The world is huge, and if Eydis is not here, they would have no choice but to give up the search."
0,Staying here is the only reason there is any danger at all.
0,"If we leave, then there will be no reason to fight.”"
0,Rynn flashed in Eydis’s mind.
0,Taking her with would not be possible unless she found some way to introduce her to Justin and his women.
0,Then there was the princess.
0,"She could not take her without first finding a new location to hide her, and there was no telling how difficult that could be."
0,"“I… I do not feel that is smart…” Eydis said, not knowing how she would convince Justin."
0,"“I agree,” Miriam added, much to Eydis’s relief and surprise."
0,"“I cannot explain it well, but something is telling me that we shouldn’t leave the city.”"
0,"Eydis almost thought she saw a wisp of something floating around Miriam’s head, but it vanished when she looked at it."
0,"Justin’s eyes also narrowed, and he glanced around the room, searching."
0,Did he see it as well?
0,"“Yah, and you graduate in a little over a month,” Sammy yelled, pulling Justin back into the conversation."
0,"“What are you thinking, trying to quit school so close to finishing?"
0,We still don’t even know if anything will happen.”
0,"Sammy added her disproval by rebuking Justin, but Justin did not look convinced."
0,"Eydis stumbled upon the key she thought might tip the discussion to her favor, Jethro’s genocide of the fairies in his search for the missing wife of the emperor."
0,"“Justin, staying here is the safest option for the people of this world."
0,"If Jethro learns that I left to another city, he would destroy city after city looking for me or to draw me out of hiding."
0,That is the kind of man he is.
0,"With me here, he has chosen to stay hidden and not disturb the people of this world as much as possible.”"
0,“You seem familiar with those searching for you.” 
0,Dr. Shuman’s question froze Eydis in her chair.
0,"In Eydis’s haste to convince Justin, she had made a mistake."
0,The princess only met Jethro when he tried to assassinate her.
0,She would not know anything about him.
0,"If she already told them she knew nothing, her comment would raise suspicion."
0,Her mind raced to come up with an explanation.
0,“Jethro… He is well known in my world.
0,He leads the humans that are at war with the Amelian Empire.”
0,"“If you know a lot about him, then we might better understand the tactics he could use."
0,This information will be helpful.”
0,Eydis held in her sigh of relief but could not stop the thundering of her panicked heart.
0,She reminded herself once again not to assume the princess or the humans knew anything and to only focus on knowledge gained after her capture.
0,"She was walking along the edge of a knife, and the slightest misstep could rend her in two."
0,"“If that is the case, then Eydis should stay,” Dr. Shuman said, ending the topic of running away."
0,"“However, we will need to exercise extreme caution."
0,"Eydis will know best what the enemy is capable of, so make sure to listen to her."
0,"I have a class that I need to attend to, so we should end our discussion soon."
0,Do we all agree on what to tell the police?”
0,"Everyone nodded, but Chloe still expressed her disapproval of blaming refugees."
0,“You will not be joining us?” Sean asked.
0,"“I apologize, but I cannot cancel this class.”"
0,“Then I will take charge of the discussions with the police.
0,I have connections there.
0,Is everyone fine with this?”
0,"“I hope you know we are all going with,” Sammy said."
0,“I expected as much.”
0,“Then I’m fine with it.” 
0,"Once everyone agreed, they filed out of the room."
0,Eydis was the last to leave.
0,Justin stood beside her and grabbed her hand.
0,“Don’t worry.
0,Everything will work out.”
0,His grip tightened and a confident smile grew on his face.
0,Justin’s calm demeanor had the opposite effect that he intended.
0,It only increased her worries.
0,She inhaled deep and breathed out slowly.
0,Can I even do this?
1,"* * *
The group left the university by bus."
0,"Even though Sean’s car had sufficient room for six, he vehemently refused letting four sit in the back seat when there were only three seatbelts."
0,They traveled to the inner city and exited the bus next to a large three-story stone building with shallow concrete steps in the front leading to pillars that lined the front entrance.
0,"A few casually dressed civilians stood near the windows or front counter inside, but the black-uniformed men and women stole Eydis’s attention."
0,"They appeared completely different than what she would expect on Whinhlem, especially due to the lack of armor, but the badges were definitive markers."
0,These were city guards.
0,The association called the police guarded the city.
0,What struck Eydis as odd was the lack of visible weaponry.
0,"If the humans of this world could not use magic, what means would the guards have to fight Jethro’s men?"
0,"Even if the police excelled in unarmed combat, they would be at a disadvantage against the combined weapons and magic Jethro’s men employed."
0,The ability of the police to repel the assassins grew more and more infeasible in Eydis’s mind.
0,“Will the police even be able to do anything?” Eydis asked Justin in a whisper.
0,He continued holding her hand and squeezed it lightly.
0,"She tolerated this level of contact because she had seen him hold the princess’s hand often, and she was recovering ven as well, a surprising amount for the light contact."
0,"“They would be able to fight them better than us, at least.”"
0,His weak response did not calm Eydis’s worries.
0,Sean approached one of the receptionists and explained that they had information on the bloody events outside of town a week ago.
0,He added that Eydis’s missing person’s case filed by Ryan Shuman was involved and that she was here with them.
0,"The receptionist asked if Sean would like to fill out what he knew in writing, but he demanded that he speak with the highest-ranking officer available because lives were at stake."
0,"Sean’s words reeked with urgency, so the receptionist left the counter and spoke briefly with a female guard in the back."
0,“Someone will be here for you soon.”
0,"After a ten-minute wait, one of the police approached."
0,"“Sean, I heard you have some urgent information for us.”"
0,Sean shook the man’s hand.
0,"“Major Wickenny, I would like to request a private room to discuss this."
0,Is that possible?”
0,“Of course.
0,Your friends included?”
0,"“I would prefer them included, because this involves all of us to varying extents."
0,Can we use one of the conference rooms?”
0,Major Wickenny scanned his eyes over the group.
0,"“I hope you understand that due to the nature of what your information might entail and what you just told me, we would prefer to discuss with each of you individually in private.”"
0,"“I understand that, and I am sure everyone here would be willing, but there are parts of this that we would prefer to explain together."
0,Before I speak any further in the open can we move to somewhere more private?
0,You can decide if you need to hear from us individually there.”
0,Major Wickenny paused for a moment of contemplation and then nodded.
0,“Follow me.”
1,Major Wickenny led the group through a locked door and up two flights of stairs.
0,He engaged in idle chat with Sean as they led the group.
0,Eydis had to wonder about the nature of their connection.
0,"If Sean was associated with the city guards, was he planning on becoming a guard, a police, as well?"
0,Nothing about Sean’s stature suggested that he was fit for combat.
0,"Many of the officers were not as fit as guards and soldiers from her world, but she could tell that they exercised."
0,Sean looked like he had never worked a sweat in his life.
0,"“Sean is doing graduate studies in crime analysis,” Justin replied, having noticed Eydis’s confused gaze directed as Sean and Major Wickenny."
0,“He did an academic internship of sorts here earlier last year.”
0,Justin’s explanation only furthered Eydis’s confusion.
0,All she gleaned from Justin’s complicated terminology was that Sean probably worked here for a brief amount of time.
0,"Given Justin’s explanation, it seemed this was information that the princess was never told."
1,Major Wickenny led them to a room with a large rectangular table in the center.
0,The room sat at the corner of the building with windows along the entirety of two walls.
0,Blue vertical blinds hung open allowing them to see the city.
0,"Much of it was obscured from view due to the room being on the second floor, but many of the taller buildings were visible above the shorter roofs of the nearby structures."
0,Everyone sat on the length side of the table with Eydis in the center and Justin and Sean beside her.
0,"The girls took the remaining seats, filling every seat on their side save one chair."
0,Major Wickenny sat across from them and removed a small device from his pocket.
0,“Do you mind if I record our discussion?” he asked.
0,"“Of course not,” Sean replied."
0,"Another two police, one man and one woman, entered the room and sat beside Major Wickenny."
0,"“You mentioned you have information on what happened outside of town, and all present are connected in some way?”"
0,"“Yes, but I would like to begin with a missing person’s report filed five days ago by Dr. Ryan Shuman, a professor at the university."
0,"It was for Eydis FeAmel, a refugee who was working at the university as a fitness instructor."
0,She disappeared the night of the events outside town and only recently showed up last night.
0,She is seated here next to me.”
0,Eydis closed her eyes and bowed slightly after Sean’s introduction.
0,“You are saying that the two are connected?”
0,“They are.
0,The increase in missing persons cases in Gullivan; I believe Eydis’s case may be connected to the others.”
0,The male police on Major Wickenny’s left leaned in and whispered something into his ear.
0,None heard it on Eydis’s side of the table except her.
0,"“The evidence found at the house suggests a connection, does it not,” she repeated verbatim aside from the affirmation at the end."
0,"She felt that this was information her side of the table needed to know, that these police were involved in the investigation of the property and Jethro’s assassins."
0,"More importantly, if they were going to gain the aid of the city guard, these police needed to understand that their citizens had also fallen victim to Jethro’s men."
0,The police officer’s eyes widened.
0,He sat straight in his chair and removed a small memo pad and writing utensil for future silent communication.
0,"Perhaps there was more to be said, but Eydis spoke too early."
0,She silently chastised her impatience.
0,"“I’ve been following the cases out of curiosity, and the original owner of that house was never added to the list of missing persons, to my knowledge."
0,"Anyone who might have discovered the owner missing ended up missing themselves, at least if they visited that location,” Sean mused."
0,"“If those who occupied that house had means of disguising or altering the location the person went missing, they could continue occupation of that house without suspect.”"
0,Major Wickenny cut him off.
0,"“Sean, because this is a multiple homicide with an ongoing investigation, I have to stop you there.”"
0,Eydis felt she finally understood Sean’s relation to the city guard.
0,He was very intelligent and made connection to Jethro’s men hiding the bodies and abandoning the automated carriages in far-away locations.
0,Perhaps he was an inquisitor for the city guard.
0,"“As I suspected,” Major Wickenny continued, “we will need to speak with you all individually."
0,You understand why.”
0,"“I do, but none here were personally involved in what happened outside the city except Eydis,” Sean replied."
0,"“More precisely, those terrorists who occupied that house were searching for Eydis specifically."
0,They abducted her from the university.
0,Eydis fought them but was captured in the end.
0,"When the few survivors attempted to remove her from the city, she managed to escape."
0,"If you are looking for the culprit of the deaths in that field, it was Eydis, but it was all in self-defense.”"
0,Major Wickenny’s eyebrows furrowed either from Sean’s insistence on continuing or because he did not believe Sean’s story.
0,He looked at the two officers at his side and then voiced his disbelief.
0,"“Disregarding the improbable timing of Ms. FeAmel’s disappearance and the massacre at that house she was supposedly involved in, are you saying that all that damage out there was caused by a fight between Ms. FeAmel and a handful of who you claim are terrorists?"
0,"Sean, you have done wonderful work for us in the past, so I value the information you give, but--”"
0,"“I can prove it,” Eydis interrupted."
0,Major Wickenny fell silent.
0,"If the police were going to cooperate and help confront Jethro’s men entering the city, they needed to believe Sean’s story."
0,Only she could prove it without a doubt.
0,“I can describe the bodies you likely found.
0,There were ten men in total.
0,Two were dead in the house and were cut down.
0,Their bodies were likely burnt from the fire.
0,A short yet muscular one was lying in the field with no physical damage.
0,He died from his heart failing.
0,Three other men in the field died from being stabbed or cut.
0,One man blew himself up.
0,The largest crater was from him.
0,"There was one larger man, and his body is in pieces all over the field."
0,And what might be the strangest for you are the last two men.
0,"They look as men but were much, much smaller, like young children.”"
0,The officer on Major Wickenny’s left wrote something on the memo pad and handed it to him.
0,Eydis did not need to hear or see the message to know the contents.
0,The descriptions matched up.
0,"“There is still something I cannot follow,” the female guard on the right said."
0,“I find it hard to believe that you alone were able to defeat that many people given how much damage was done to the property.”
0,"Sammy, who sat next to Justin, raised her hand."
0,“Eydis has been teaching self-defense classes at the university.
0,"If you ask Dr. Calliby or any of her students, the girls here included, we could tell you that she is very skilled at fighting."
0,She’s been practicing for 19 years.”
0,"“That’s not it,” the other guard cut in."
0,"The two extra police seemed to have dropped the idea of questioning everyone individually, much to Eydis’s relief and Major Wickenny’s annoyance."
0,"“The explosions, the craters, the large trench dug across the ground, the damage to the house."
0,"In all of that, there was not a single trace of any explosive or shell or bullet."
0,The only weapons we found were swords and knives.
0,You cannot tell us that all that damage was done with those.”
0,Sean rubbed his temples with his thumb and forefingers.
0,"Almost as if on cue, everyone else on their side of the table looked to Justin."
0,He exhaled loudly.
0,“It’s always up to me to decide what can and cannot be said…” he moaned.
0,"“If you have something to say, I suggest you say it,” Major Wickenny warned."
0,Justin placed a hand on Eydis’s shoulder.
0,“The reason we came to the police about all this was because there are more of those terrorists out there in the city.
0,"If you encounter them, you will find out anyway, and not knowing might cause otherwise preventable casualties."
0,"This goes against what we were planning on telling you because Eydis wishes it to remain secret, but for your safety as you track these people down, you need to know.”"
0,"Major Wickenny leaned forward in his seat, resting his elbows on the table."
0,"“Eydis, can you create a light breeze in the room?"
0,Just a little wind is fine.”
0,"The three police glanced at each other, perplexed by Justin’s peculiar request."
0,Eydis hesitated.
0,Did the princess not try her hardest to prevent her magic from being widely known?
0,"The princess trusted Justin, but Eydis was not so foolish to rely on another’s trust in an individual."
0,"However, Eydis’s origins and abilities remained secret from the masses under Justin’s supervision."
0,"To everyone else that Eydis saw during her observations, the princess was just another human, so perhaps showing her magic to the guard would be safe if Justin felt it safe."
0,Eydis readied her transmission formula in case her trust in the princess’s man was ill-placed.
0,"She breathed in, and air swirled above her outstretched hand."
0,It built until the air in the room circulated in a light breeze which ebbed after Eydis withdrew her hand.
0,The faces of the police were a mixture of confusion and surprise.
0,"“This is the reason the terrorists are after her,” Justin continued."
0,"“She can use magic, as could her family."
0,They opposed the terrorists and were assassinated.
0,"She alone was able to escape and found her way here as a refugee, but they followed because they do not want anyone to live who can use magic to oppose them."
0,None of us were expecting that.”
0,"“Sorry, but this is just hard to believe…” the female guard said, trading glances with Major Wickenny and the other guard."
0,“It’s not that hard to believe!” Miriam pounded the table to draw the attention of the officers.
0,"She held out her hand, and above her palm tan granules appeared from nowhere and condensed into a monochromatic tan-colored stone that she slid across the table to the police."
0,Major Wickenny grabbed the stone and inspected it with wide eyes.
0,“We are risking our own safety to tell you this so don’t go disregarding our warnings.”
0,Sammy followed Miriam’s example and created a cloud of mist above her hand but did not condense it into water.
0,Chloe lit a small flame on her forefinger and sent it dancing across the tips of her fingers.
0,"“What we are saying,” Justin cut in, “is that the terrorists are capable of using magic as well, just like Eydis."
0,"What Eydis taught us is very simple and harmless, but the terrorists are far more powerful."
0,The man who blew up did not use a bomb.
0,He detonated himself with fire magic.
0,All the damage you saw at the scene was not from a weapon.
0,They do not need bombs or firearms.
0,Each terrorist is a human weapon.”
0,Major Wickenny’s eyes widened larger than Eydis felt was natural.
0,"“The one we recovered, what is his condition?”"
0,The male guard contracted Major Wickenny’s panic.
0,“We received word that he stabilized early yesterday and was expected to wake at any time from then on.”
0,Major Wickenny glared at Eydis.
0,“I want you to make yourself absolutely clear.
0,Is everything you said real?
0,Are these men dangerous without any weapons?”
0,Eydis looked back into Major Wickenny’s eyes with all seriousness.
0,“I impaled the stomach of the fire mage and he was still able to create that explosion before he died.
0,He nearly killed me.
0,"Weapon or not, injured or not, they are very dangerous.”"
0,Major Wickenny removed a rectangular black object from his waist and held it up to his mouth.
0,“Emergency.
0,We need backup at the hospital on West 6th.
0,Evacuate the entire north wing and lock it down.
0,Small Man is considered armed and dangerous.
0,"I repeat, Small Man is considered armed and dangerous."
0,Exercise extreme caution.”
0,"“One of them survived, and you kept him alive?!” "
0,Eydis could not believe what she heard.
0,One of the minums lived and was being kept at some place called a hospital.
0,"Of all the people they could have saved, the minums were the most dangerous unarmed due to their aptitude for magic."
0,Major Wickenny frowned.
0,"“I don’t know what country you escaped from, but here, we don’t simply kill unarmed and injured people.”"
0,The response that came back over the communication device stated that the third floor of the north wing of the hospital was already ablaze as of no more than five minutes ago.
0,Major Wickenny stared in shock at Eydis’s reproachful glare.
0,"Chapter 5
“Secrecy is no longer an option.”
Fect"
1,"“Kimmel, Fect, Penk, you three are the brightest fire mages under my command, so there is advanced magic that I want to teach you.” "
0,"… “Fect, did you hear?"
0,Kimmel was sent to another world!”
0,… “Kimmel is missing in action.
0,"Fect, be on standby for deployment.”"
0,"… “Fect, because there are no Minums in that world, stay hidden and observe."
0,There will likely be places you can go that the others cannot.
0,Use your high sensitivity to ven to try and detect when the princess might use spatial magic.
0,"You have no time limit, and I will not contact you directly.”"
0,… “Mordok is ordering us to be present during her capture.
0,Be careful.
0,He brought his Lurr with him.”
0,"… “Hello, princess.” "
0,… The Lurr’s fist hammered the ground with tremendous force.
0,Rock and frozen earth shot from the crater and approached at incredible speed.
1,Fect woke in a panic.
0,He writhed and screamed and patted his body.
0,Each impact of his small hands was felt on his child-sized torso.
0,"He did not know what death felt like or if there was any feeling at all, but the coarse feeling of his hands on the charred remains of the swiftly burning garment was real."
0,A spark from the contraption beside him drew his attention to the blazing inferno inside the small room.
0,"He was alive, and in his fright, he had expelled flames that now covered the bed, walls, and ceiling."
0,"A high-pitched sound rang incessantly, and he could not concentrate enough through the deafening noise to reason about where he was."
0,His mind was clouded as if having awoken from a deep slumber.
0,“Where am I?”
0,"The door to the room flung open, and a man in black clothing stood in the doorframe."
0,He shielded his face from the intense heat and marveled at the small man who stared back at him unaffected by the flames that would surely burn him alive.
0,"The man noticed something on the ground out of sight from Fect’s position atop the bed and drew a small object from the sheath on his belt, aiming it at Fect."
0,Fect sensed aggression in the posture.
0,Fect gathered concentrated fire ven into his eyes and expelled it as a thin beam focused on the center of the man’s torso.
0,"The man erupted in flames, but what Fect did not expect was the thunderous noise that followed."
0,He felt a sharp pain in his left arm as if he had been stabbed.
0,He touched the wound and felt the flakey powder of his blood flash-drying and burning in the intense heat as it left his body.
0,"The handheld item was a weapon, and the projectile it fired was too small and too fast to see."
0,Its offensive capabilities nearly rivaled his.
0,"If it had hit him somewhere vital, he knew he would be dead, but to his relief, the tiny object passed through his arm."
0,"It hurt, but he was alive and could manage the pain."
0,He needed to escape before more armed people appeared.
0,Fect weakened the heat resistance of the wound to let the heat of the room cauterize it.
0,"He jumped off the thin, metal-framed bed onto the floor."
0,There he saw what caused the man’s hostility.
0,"A woman had the misfortune of being in the room when Fect awoke in an enflamed panic, and she now lay blackened and burning."
0,He kicked her legs aside and ran out the open door.
1,"White light blinded his eyes, and the incessant ringing blared full force."
0,"A man in a white robe approached, and in Fect’s irritation and confusion, he focused on the floor at the man’s feet."
0,"It heated rapidly, and the formulated fire ven in the beam from his eyes erupted in a flaming pillar."
0,It engulfed and charred him black instantly before the he could cause Fect any harm as the black-clothed man had.
0,The flaming pillar clung to the nearby wall and spread to the ceiling as screams echoed louder in the hallways.
0,A misty rain fell from the ceiling as if attempting to quell the inferno.
0,Everyone who saw stopped helping others evacuate and either ran for their own lives or collapsed on the ground in fear.
0,No one assaulted him or even dared to approach.
0,Fect had time to assess his situation.
0,“Where am I?”
0,His words from back in the small room repeated themselves with redoubled confusion.
0,He scanned the parallel hallways connected by a small room or lobby no wider than the distance between the two hallways.
0,The floor was smooth and polished and reflected the unnatural white light from the ceiling and the orange glow of his flames.
0,The ceiling was tiled with a strange material that was quick to catch a flame.
0,"In his time investigating the city for Jethro, he had infiltrated many buildings, but he had never seen the likes of this."
0,"The orange glow of the quickly spreading flames made the blinding white floor, walls, ceiling, and lights more tolerable."
0,"The cowering few appeared unarmed, but the man who entered the room was armed and hostile."
0,“Is this a government facility?
0,Military?” Perhaps this was a government facility he missed or was in some confined or hidden location inside one he thought he searched thoroughly.
0,"Fect looked back into his room at the machines and menacing metal arms that bent over his metal bed, entangled in melting cables and wires."
0,Burning straps hung from the sides of the bed to the ground.
0,They bound him in a small room with someone overseeing him and a hostile guard waiting just outside the door.
0,"This was a prison, and they were waiting for him to wake in order to interrogate and possibly torture him."
0,Color drained from Fect’s face.
0,This world had technology that could never be imitated in Whinhlem.
0,He could not imagine what methods of torture were available to a city with such incredible and terrifying ingenuity.
0,He needed to escape this place.
0,He could not risk being recaptured.
0,Fect rushed over to one of the cowering women and grabbed her by her hair.
0,"She screamed and flailed her arms, trying desperately to push him away, but Fect held fire in his hand close to her face."
0,Her struggling immediately ceased.
0,“Where go?!
0,Where out?!” 
0,"Fect spoke what broken English he knew, but the woman was unresponsive."
0,She stared at the flame as its heat drew out beads of sweat that ran down her face.
0,"The orange glow of the fire reflected in her terrified, watery eyes."
0,He would gain no information from her.
0,"He doubted he would be able to understand what she said even if she was willing to tell him the location of the exit, and he wished that his deployment had been delayed so that he could learn this city’s language from an educated instructor like many of his comrades."
0,"Everything he knew was self-taught, and that amounted to little."
0,"Giving up on asking for the location of the exit, he pressed the fire into the woman’s face and increased its intensity until she died in the blaze amid her wailing screams."
0,He then turned to the final person cowering behind the desk in the center of the room.
0,The man’s face bled horror from watching such a gruesome execution.
0,Tears streamed from his wide eyes as he shook his head pleading.
0,Fect lit a pillar of fire beneath him.
0,The room was now fully ablaze with fires too strong for the mist to extinguish.
0,"Fect could handle the heat, and the rapidly growing smoke was no cause for concern either."
0,"Using wind magic, he held his hand near his mouth to purify the air he breathed."
0,His affinities were perfectly suited for fighting in fires within closed spaces.
0,"Large metal doors located at the end of the hallways not only prevented the fire from spreading, but they also kept in the smoke."
0,The doors to each of the rooms along the walls appeared to provide the same function.
0,Even the first pillar of fire Fect created had not burned through the door right next to it.
0,"Whatever the purpose of this facility, it was designed to suppress and even extinguish fires."
0,"If he wanted to escape, he needed to pass through one of the doors."
0,The question became which one would lead to an exit.
0,"Not knowing where to go, Fect ran down the hallway to his left."
0,He thought he recalled more people fleeing down that direction.
0,He threw a volatile fireball at the door.
1,The metal buckled and blew outward in the explosion.
0,"Just as Fect had guessed, the smoke had not passed the door."
0,The wide intersecting hallway spread in both directions.
0,People dressed in white and light shades of blue and green rushed others out of rooms on metal-framed beds similar to the one Fect was strapped to not moments before.
0,Their quick evacuation hastened with fear after seeing the explosion of the door.
0,The scrambling people avoided Fect.
0,"None showed any hostility towards him, so he reasoned that they were noncombatants."
0,"Only the man in the black uniform was armed, but he could not make any assumptions."
0,"If the color of their clothing carried some significance, there may be others who wore a color other than black that were also armed."
0,Fect quickly scanned the hallway for a direction to flee.
0,Far down the hall to the right was a large window that stretched the entire length of the wall.
0,He could see the white overcast sky and the tips of the trees.
0,He ran with haste and jumped onto the padded blue benches that lined the underside of the window.
0,He saw a large building complex.
0,"Two other buildings were visible from his, and from the level of those buildings, he was on the third floor."
0,Only part of the cityscape was visible.
0,He could not recognize his location.
0,A small fear bubbled up from the depths of his mind that he had been taken to a different city.
0,"If that was true, how then would he find his way back?"
0,Location was the least of Fect’s unanswered concerns.
0,Metal carriages with red and blue flares affixed on top of them poured into the paved lot below.
0,Men in black uniforms exited the carriages and weaved past the evacuating people to enter the building.
0,Reinforcements arrived.
0,The city was not unguarded as previously believed.
0,The speed of the carriages enabled the guards to quickly respond to threats and removed the need for large numbers or regular patrols.
0,A missing piece of the puzzle that was this bewildering city had been found but in the worst manner possible.
0,Escape was now far more difficult.
1,Fect ran to the left along the windowed hallway in the direction he had seen others flee.
0,It opened into a grand stairway that led down to a two-story balconied lobby.
0,The second level balcony at the bottom of the steps was lined with a fogged glass railing.
0,Warm climate plants with broad leaves grew from large brass vases.
0,"This was grandeur unfitting for a prison, but if not a prison, what was this large building where in they kept a spy bound and under guard?"
0,"“Hey, boy, follow me."
0,We need to…”
0,Someone’s hand grabbed Fect’s arm from behind.
0,"In a panic, he set him ablaze in another pillar of fire."
0,Screams broke out on the first and second floors from those still evacuating the building.
0,Fect ran across the balcony to the stairs.
0,There he encountered two black-uniformed guards with the same small projectile weapons in hand.
0,“Get on the ground!
0,Get on the ground!”
0,They did not immediately attack but instead shouted commands.
0,"If Fect retaliated, they could attack even if he killed them just as the first guard had."
0,He shrouded himself in fire ven and meticulously formulated the heat to refract the light around him.
0,His body blurred in the waves of heat until he disappeared.
0,The two guards watched in disbelief.
0,"One began to lower his weapon, and the other motioned him to stay alert."
0,Fect was annoyed by that guard’s wisdom.
0,"Although he was concealed, the covering was not perfect."
0,"Jethro explained that if perfected, this magic would conceal while in motion, but Fect was yet unskilled."
0,"If he moved, the covering would weaken, and his blurred outline would become visible."
0,"The concealment magic also drained his ven at a staggering pace, and he could not keep it active for long."
0,The guards asserted their aim while their eyes scanned their surroundings.
0,"Fect tried to slowly inch to the side so that his camouflage would not waver, but the experienced guard had keen eyesight."
0,“He’s still there!
0,The air is distorted!”
0,“Suspect is armed and dangerous.
0,Exercise extreme caution if contacted.” 
0,A muffled voice spoke from the direction of the two men.
0,"One of the guards reached for an item on his waist tethered by a thin, coiling cord."
0,"“Target encountered, lobby, second floor."
0,He… he has some sort of cloaking tech.
0,He turned invisible right in front of--”
0,Fect dove to the side while simultaneously throwing a fireball.
0,"The two weapons fired with the same thunderous noise, but the projectiles missed."
0,"The fireball exploded, covering the stairs where the two men stood and part of the balcony where Fect dove."
0,"He hid in the flames and ran down the stairs past the two wailing, burning bodies to the first floor of the lobby."
1,"Outside the large windows, the number of carriages with blue and red flares had increased drastically."
0,"Numerous guards gathered, heading in Fect’s direction."
0,"For the first time, Fect saw the black-uniformed men carrying something that was clearly a weapon."
0,"He could tell it was similar in design to the small handheld weaponry the earlier guards used, but these were the length of a grown man’s arm."
0,"If the small ones had the power to send a projectile through his arm, the larger ones would be far greater."
0,"Common sense dictated that the larger the weapon, the greater the power, even if the nature of the weapons was unknown."
0,No sensible weaponsmith would increase the size of a weapon at the cost of power.
0,Exiting the main doors of the lobby was no longer safe.
0,"Fect feared that the moment he opened the door, he would be killed in an instant."
0,Fect noticed three stragglers run off in a different direction.
0,"He pursued them down a side hallway, and to his relief, there was a door at the end that led outside."
0,He waited until the three escaped so that they would not see him exit.
1,"Once outside, he activated his concealment magic."
0,"Behind him, the fire from his attacks on the third floor set the side of the building ablaze."
0,A large pillar of black smoke billowed into the air.
0,The fire should keep them preoccupied.
0,"Fect slowly walked across a narrow road, weaved through the grass and shrubbery, and climbed over the fence."
0,There he removed his concealment magic.
1,"A wide, busy road stretched in both directions."
0,Fect stood in grass atop a wall about thirty feet above the shoulder of the road.
0,He ran along it until the fence became another wall on his left and the thin patch of grass grew wide enough for shrubs to grow.
0,"Now that he was out of the building complex and had traveled some distance down the wide highway, he sat down behind some thick brush to catch his breath."
0,"After looking around, he was able to rid himself of one of his worries."
0,"Although this part of the city was unfamiliar, he recognized the same distinct buildings that towered above into the sky."
0,"By using these buildings and the mountains to orient him, he found that he was on the opposite side of the city from the house his team used as a base of operations."
0,It was an hour’s walk outside the city on the other side of the river and possibly three hours from his current location.
0,His only hope was to reach it and wait until Jethro opened the portal once more.
0,"The adrenaline in Fect’s body calmed, and the pain of his injuries fired back through his nerves at full force."
0,He lay back behind the shrub and fought in a mental struggle to endure the pain.
0,"His skin stung, and his muscles ached in specific locations on his torso, arms, and legs."
0,"All over his body, injuries were sealed shut."
0,The small pockmarks along the wounds suggested they were sewn but the threads burnt in the flames.
0,"When the Lurr giant attacked the princess, Fect had been in the path of the debris."
0,The many injuries that had nearly killed him had been treated at that facility.
0,"Aside from the guards, those at the facility were non-combatants."
0,There were others on similar beds to the one he was bound to.
0,He was not being restrained as a criminal.
0,His injuries were severe enough that movement could be detrimental to his recovery.
0,That was a medical facility.
0,The severity of Fect’s actions struck him harder than the debris of the Lurr.
0,How much time had passed?
0,"If his comrades were successful in capturing the princess, would they have need of opening the portal again?"
0,What if he was left behind?
0,What if he was abandoned for dead?
0,"He removed the witnesses near his room, but many saw him during his escape of the building, and those who recovered him after the battle with the princess knew his appearance."
0,The city guards also knew he was there.
0,No others in this world could use magic.
0,It was a skill unique to him.
0,"While investigating the city and searching for the princess, Fect had stayed hidden."
0,Not once had he taken a life of someone in the city.
0,"Although he was associated with those who had killed and captured citizens, he had not taken part."
0,"His job as a scout was to observe, and he only participated directly once the princess was located."
0,"If he had realized his situation and stayed in the medical facility until he was healed, he might have received a lighter punishment if he explained why they were hunting the princess and could have even helped the city as had the princess."
0,"If Jethro truly left him behind, all hope of integrating himself into this world’s society was destroyed the moment he killed medical staff, guards, and set fire to a medical facility."
0,“My life is over…”
0,"Fect was a soldier, and though younger than most, he was trusted with a mission to this foreign world that he knew had no guarantee of survival or return."
0,"“If Jethro has abandoned me, then I will die with honor."
0,"But first,” he looked in the direction of the nearby mountains, “I must return to base.”"
0,There was no guarantee that the mission had been successful or that Jethro had lost all interest in this world even if the mission was a success.
0,He had to make certain the portal would not reopen.
0,Fect rolled to his knees to stand.
0,"His body fought him with every movement, but his legs held solid."
0,"His body ached, but the pain was bearable."
0,One foot led the other.
0,"He pushed himself forward with a third step and then a fourth, slowly forcing his body into an unstable run."
1,"After a few minutes of flight, the wall he stood atop descended to only a couple feet off the highway."
0,"The road gradually bent to the right, the opposite direction Fect needed to go."
0,"The wall on his left prevented him from leaving the banked shoulder, and there was no visible way through it down the road."
0,"The city guards had not pursued him thus far, so Fect risked breaching the wall, but he had to be subtle about it."
0,Fect stopped next to the wall behind a shrub large enough to conceal him.
0,"With an intense but small fireball, he blew a hole in the base of the wall with minimal smoke from the blast."
0,The masonry was far stronger than he anticipated.
0,The stone blew out weakly and only crumbled to the ground on the other side.
0,Metal bars lined the inside.
0,"Heating metal was easy for a fire mage, but melting it was often difficult."
0,Kimmel was his superior in fire magic and was adept at heating and manipulating stone and metal due to having affinities to both fire and earth.
0,"Fect could not melt or bend the metal, but he had another method at his disposal, again taught him by Jethro."
0,Fect lit an intense flame on the tip of his extended fore and middle fingers.
0,He then expelled wind from between those fingers.
0,"After gauging the intensity of the flame and the purity of the air, the flame elongated and grew white."
0,It cut through the metal reinforcing in a shower of sparks to give him enough room to slip through.
1,"On the other side, small trees and shrubs grew sparsely between the wall and another fence."
0,Fect had to wonder where this city’s obsession with perimeter barriers came from and why they were all inside the city on individual properties but not a single wall surrounded its borders.
0,The fence encased a field of grass where children played in the distance.
0,Three children stood near the fence and watched Fect emerge.
0,“Look!
0,He’s naked!”
0,"Two boys laughed, but the girl ran away."
0,"One of the boys was taller than Fect, but the other was close to Fect’s size."
0,Fect ran to the fence and climbed over it before the two could react.
0,He knocked out the taller boy with a kick to the side of his head as he jumped down.
0,"The smaller boy began crying, so Fect placed his hand over the boy’s mouth."
0,"“Give clothes,” Fect ordered."
0,"The crying child was too scared to obey, so Fect knocked him out and stripped him."
0,"Down the field, the girl returned with a woman who immediately sprinted towards him after noticing his assault on the children."
0,She removed something from her pocket.
0,"Fect tucked the shirt and pants under his arm, grabbed the cap the taller boy wore, and hopped back over the fence."
0,"The woman did not chase, but she held the communication device all humans of this world carried to her ear."
0,She was reporting him.
0,City guards would surely follow.
0,"Now that he obtained this world’s clothing, blending in as one of the city’s children was possible, but Fect’s facial stubble was a problem."
0,His beard grew quite full for his age.
0,"He rubbed his cheeks, chin, and neck."
0,"The stubble burnt off in the heat of his hand, resulting in a much younger, youthful face that had often been a point of ridicule among his colleagues."
0,"Fect could do nothing about his youthful appearance being only a one-and-a-half-year-old minum, but now it was his saving grace."
0,"So long as no one looked too closely, he would appear no different than a slender-faced human boy of half a year old."
1,The end of the fence opened into a mixed residential and small commercial district of the city.
0,The buildings were not as grand as those at the medical facility or closer to the center of the city.
0,They reminded Fect of the far side of the river.
0,"If he continually travelled in the direction of the mountains, he would meet the river and could follow it most of the way to the outskirts of the city."
0,"But first, he needed a rest."
0,"Running along the highway wall, converting wind ven to cut through it, hopping a fence twice, and then running again to distance himself from the field of children severely shortened his breath in the thin air of this world."
0,"He was confident in his endurance, and his incredibly light weight made acrobatics easier, but in his injured state, he was reaching his limit."
0,"The field of children was far behind him, and the wooden fences of the surrounding houses hid his location, so Fect risked a short rest."
0,He sat against one of the wooden fences and inspected the clothing.
0,"The blue pants were no different than those generally worn by many of this world’s citizens, but the shirt was peculiar."
0,It was blue with caricatures of strange animals on the front.
0,In the bottom center was a yellow rodent.
0,"On the rodent’s left was a large, shelled creature with two short metal tubes protruding from its shell."
0,On the right was a stocky lizard with a flowering plant growing from its back.
0,Behind them all in the top center was an easily recognizable dragon blowing fire into the air.
0,There was no reason behind the caricatures or why they would be on a shirt worn by a child.
0,Perhaps they were legendary creatures or gods of this world?
0,Perhaps that was an orphanage run by the local religion.
0,The same sirens Fect heard at the medical facility grew louder in the distance.
0,The short rest was over.
0,He donned the shirt and pants and found them a near perfect fit.
0,"The sirens were likely heading for the field where the children played, so Fect waited."
0,"The sirens passed by, heading further down the road."
1,He used this opportunity to run from between the houses and down the street of the residential district.
0,"The river was an unknown distance away, but because it bisected the city, he would reach it so long as he headed towards the mountains."
0,"The road turned, so Fect cut across the yard of a house and hopped a plank-wood fence."
0,He then continued through the small kempt yard and over another fence.
0,A strange sound met his ears that he had never heard the like of before.
0,It was comparable to the rapid flapping of large wings but was far more rhythmic and unnatural.
0,He looked to the sky and found a machine traveling through the air.
0,The sight took his breath away.
0,It was clearly not an animal or monster of some kind.
0,"Although the shape was different, it had windows like the carriages on the ground."
0,Some blurred force attached to the top of the contraption fastened it to the sky.
0,"Even without knowing what it was, he knew who piloted it."
0,The city guards controlled the air!
0,That flying machine was searching for him.
0,"It was still far off, but he could no longer risk taking any actions that would draw attention."
0,"If he could see it, the machine could see him."
0,He needed to find a populated location and blend in.
1,Fect ran along the road towards the direction of larger buildings.
0,The road left the residential district and widened.
0,"Four lanes of traffic traveled it, and there were more people passing along its walkways, yet there were no children, so Fect stood out."
0,"There were many children in that far field, and possibly more inside the adjacent building."
0,What if all children were communally watched in similar locations?
0,Fect would have no hope of hiding among them in plain sight.
0,Cloaking himself with fire magic to become invisible for long enough to escape the city was impossible with its incredible cost.
0,He kept a brisk stride down the side of the road looking for any means to travel hidden or be further disguised.
0,"The sound of the flying machine grew louder, so Fect dove to the side into some leafy bushes near the road."
0,"The passing people paid little attention, and those that did take notice only shook their heads, maybe thinking he was a child at play."
0,The flapping of the machine quieted.
0,Fect was about to leave his cover when he noticed a station across the road.
0,Carriages lined up beneath its canopy.
0,Their drivers tended to some screen and then placed a tube in an opening on the side of their carriage.
0,"Fect ran to the pedestrian crossing, waited until another human started crossing, and then ran across the road to the station."
0,He waited concealed near the hedge line separating the road from the stands under the canopy where the carriages parked.
0,Carriages came and went.
0,"The order of the actions and level of attention changed from person to person, but each driver that serviced their carriage at the station stood in front of the screen twice: once when arriving before placing the tube in the side of the carriage and once more when removing the tube and returning it to the stand."
0,All that he required was a suitable victim to pull their carriage up closest to the hedge.
0,The opportunity arrived quicker than anticipated.
0,A finely crafted carriage pulled in.
0,"The driver was younger, appearing no more than a year older than Fect or perhaps less."
0,He was far too skinny and unstable in his gait to be skilled in any form of combat.
0,He left his door ajar and walked to the other side of his carriage to the screen as all drivers had.
0,"Once Fect was sure no one was watching, he dove out of the bushes and into the box seat."
0,He crawled into the back behind the box seat and waited.
0,"A small white bag that smelled of fried food sat beside him, and its enticing aroma made his throat constrict and saliva pool in his mouth."
0,How log had it been since he last ate?
0,How long had he been unconscious?
0,"Fect reached for the food, but the driver finished servicing the carriage too quickly."
0,The driver entered and closed the door.
1,The carriage grew alive with a loud hum.
0,It rolled out of the lot and turned onto the road.
0,Fect jumped into the passenger seat beside the driver.
0,The driver startled at the sudden appearance of a child and swerved on the road but managed not to collide with any other carriages.
0,Loud horns blared all around.
0,"“The fuck you doing, kid?”"
0,Fect looked at the man whose expression quickly grew surprised after seeing an adult of Fect’s stature.
0,“No kid.
0,"You,” Fect pointed at the mountains in the distance, “go there!”"
0,“What?
0,No!
0,Get out of my car!”
0,"The man turned the wheel, and the carriage turned with it, pulling towards the side of the road."
0,Fect conjured a small flame in his hand and increased its intensity without increasing its size so that the man could feel the heat.
0,The fabric ceiling of the carriage began to smoke.
0,The driver stopped the carriage suddenly before reaching the roadside.
0,Fect held onto the back of the seat to not get thrown forward and pointed to the mountains again.
0,Once more a cacophony of horns blared around them.
0,“Go there!”
0,“You serious!?”
0,“GO!”
0,The scared man directed the carriage without another complaint.
0,"Fect extinguished his flame, but a large brown spot remained on the fabric ceiling smoldering with small embers."
0,"If Fect had learned to control these carriages as some of his companions had, he would not need this fool’s help."
0,"Then again, he was short in stature and would not have been able to operate it well even if he had learned."
0,These machines were not built with consideration to short people.
0,At least he had a ride.
0,"Fect reasoned that if he could leave the city, traveling would become much easier."
0,The only question in his mind was whether to stop the man at the river and follow the river out of town or to continue out of town to the road up the mountain and then walk around the city to the base.
0,"The former would keep him in the city longer, increasing his chances of being spotted by the guards on the ground."
0,"The latter would give him more freedom of movement, but the distance was further with little cover, increasing the chance of being spotted by the guard in the air."
0,"There was a third option, directing the man to the base, but Fect was unsure if the location was compromised."
0,"If it was, the guard in the air might notice if a carriage headed for it, or if there were guards stationed at it, an unknown carriage approaching could be reason enough for them to attack with those lethal ranged weapons, so Fect decided against it."
0,"There were many guards on the ground but only one in the air, and that guard was still circling this part of the city."
0,Fect made his decision.
0,He would drop the initial plan of traveling along the river and instead travel from the foot of the mountain.
0,The city that Fect feared would take far too long to cross on foot was now passing by at incredible speed.
0,"Inside the carriage, he had no risk of being spotted so long as the driver followed his order."
0,They turned left and after a short distance crossed the river.
0,The size of the buildings shrunk as did the number of people.
0,"After a few more turns, they pulled onto a larger straight road that Fect recognized from the shops and signboard landmarks."
0,This one would lead out of the city.
0,"Fect was grateful that the city had no walls, no gate, and no customs inspections."
0,"Travel in and out of the city was free, something he felt was foolish for such a large and populated city."
0,"Any dangerous individuals could get in, or in his case, out."
0,"After leaving the city proper, the buildings disappeared."
0,Only a large plain of dirt and dead grass with small ponds of water from the snowmelt spread before him.
0,"When the road began its incline, Fect stopped the driver."
0,"The man pulled off to the side of the road, relieved that he would not need to travel further."
0,"“I took you where you wanted, now get out of my car.”"
0,“This.
0,"Give this!” Fect held his hand to his ear, mimicking the use of the small communication device."
0,“Give what?”
0,“This!” Fect made a rectangle with his hands and again acted like he was holding the device to his ear.
0,“My phone?”
0,"“Yes, phone!"
0,Give phone!”
0,“You serious?” 
0,Fect produced another hot flame.
0,The man quickly removed his phone from his pocket and handed it over.
0,"Fect brought the two together, destroying the phone instantly."
0,Now the man would be unable to immediately summon the guards.
0,Fect looked at the door and tried to find the means to open it but couldn’t.
0,“Out.”
0,“You don’t even know how to open a door?”
0,Fect blew out the window with a weak fireball and jumped out after grabbing the bag of food from the back seat.
0,He ran across both lanes of traffic to the other side of the road and sprinted across the field.
0,"The base was still a long way off, but the guards were not following, and the flying guard was a small speck in the sky over the city."
0,The wet grass and dirt chilled Fect’s bare feet as he ran.
0,"There were ways to warm his body with fire magic, but he did not know what he would encounter at the base."
0,"If there were guards there, he might have to eliminate them, and he was already running low on ven."
1,"* * *
In his injured and tired state, the sun sunk low in the sky by the time Fect reached the familiar withered fields on the outskirts of the city."
0,He kept his distance to monitor the area around the house before he approached.
0,"When he was close enough to see it in the distance, the setting sun painted the field dark orange."
0,"The temperature was dropping fast, and there was little shelter available."
0,The house was in ruins having clearly burnt down in the struggle with the princess.
0,All that remained was a charred frame and walls.
0,"The fire had been dealt with before it could consume the structure, but far too much of it was destroyed."
0,"Still keeping his distance, Fect circled to the back of the house where the battle occurred."
0,The struggle had been far more intense than Fect thought.
0,"A massive scar was carved over the field, and a large crater sat off to the side."
0,"Worst of all, there were no signs of his comrades anywhere in the vicinity."
0,The house itself had a perimeter of thin yellow ribbon surrounding it as if warning people to stay clear.
0,"It was likely set up by the city guards, but thankfully none were present, at least that he could see."
0,"After reaffirming that the property was deserted, Fect activated his concealment magic and crept to the back of the house where a large part of the wall had been blown inward."
0,The inside was far more damaged than the outside.
0,"Some of the furniture was burnt to coal, and a few of the walls had collapsed."
0,Structural stability was questionable with many sections of ceiling caving in.
0,"The kitchen was where the portal exited, but there were no recent signs of anyone entering or leaving the kitchen."
0,"Jethro opened the portal once every nine or ten days in this world, and Fect had no way to tell how long he was unconscious other than how far his injuries had healed."
0,The areas on his body that had been penetrated or cut by debris had not fully healed.
0,"This world did not have life magic, so healing was left to the body’s natural processes, much like in his home country."
0,"From Fect’s former experiences with the healing of similar injuries, he had been out anywhere from three to five days on Whinhlem, which was anywhere from six to eleven in this world."
0,The last portal was the day before the fight with the princess.
0,"This meant that either the portal had not yet opened, or it opened and he had just missed it."
0,"Jethro opened the portal periodically throughout the day until contact was made, so Fect had a large window if it had already opened once or twice."
0,"If he missed one opening, he could catch the next, until the day passed and the portal would no longer open for another nine to ten days."
0,"If the second attempt at communication failed ten days later, then Jethro would send more people to assess the situation."
0,"If Fect missed this opening, he could wait for the next."
0,"If that portal did not open, then he would know the mission was a success and that Jethro abandoned him for dead."
0,Fect huddled in a corner of the hallway near exposed wooden beams that still looked like they held the skeletal roof sturdy.
0,He opened his now cold bag of food and began eating the long and slender fried vegetables.
0,"There was little food in the bag, so he had to ration it."
0,"Given his estimates, he could survive three days through extreme rationing, or about six in this world."
0,"If the portal did not open then, he would have to leave for more permanent shelter and food."
0,"The sun set and took with it what meager warmth was there, leaving only the deep chill of night."
0,"The destroyed house did little to insulate Fect from the cold, and he was forced to search the house for any blankets or clothing that had not burnt in the fire."
0,"Luckily, there were some that were only partially damaged in the bedroom."
0,He gathered any fabric scraps he could find into a pile in the shell of one of the lower cupboards of the kitchen in order to remain within sight of the portal’s location.
0,"Once inside, he covered himself in the charred fabric and prepared to weather the cold night, but the peaceful air was disturbed by the sound of one or two of the carriages rolling over the gravel out front of the house."
0,The glow of the red and blue flares showered through the gaps in the ruined walls and windows.
0,The guards were cunning.
0,"They expected him to return here, or perhaps they were told by someone that he would return."
0,What if the princess survived and was working with the city guard?
0,Fect huddled himself deeper inside the cupboard.
0,"Steps approached the back of the house, and three guards entered with those handheld weapons drawn."
0,"They moved with silent steps and inspected the living room, kitchen, and down the hallway."
0,"When each guard came up empty, they regrouped in the kitchen."
0,“Major said he was likely to return here.”
0,"“From the informant, that girl they were after?” "
0,“That’s my guess.” 
0,“He might not have made it here yet.
0,He’s probably hiding somewhere in the city for now.”
0,One of the guards motioned the other two to stay silent and pointed at the floor.
0,There were tiny footsteps in the soot.
0,"The footsteps led into the living room and down the hall into the study and bedroom, but they did not stay there."
0,One of the guards noticed that the footsteps entered the kitchen from outside but never left.
0,Fect’s heart beat strong enough for his injuries to sting.
0,The guards narrowed his location to the kitchen.
0,"He converted fire ven in his hands in case they located him, but something immediately drew their attention."
0,The air in the middle of the kitchen grew a long crack that widened into a black void.
0,The guards backed away in fear and aimed their weapons at it.
0,This was information that the city guards of this world could not know.
0,Fect dove out from the broken cupboard in a blaze of fire and roasted the guard nearest him.
0,The other two guards pointed their weapons and fired multiple shots.
0,One projectile penetrated Fect’s left shin while another hit his right shoulder.
0,"Undaunted, Fect ignited a pillar of fire beneath the guard to his left, killing him instantly."
0,The kitchen grew ablaze with new fire.
0,The final guard ran into the living room for cover because fire blocked the exit of the destroyed back wall.
0,Fect pursued to prevent the guard from exiting the front door and reporting the portal.
0,"The moment Fect entered the living room he was shot again, a burning pain passing into his stomach."
0,He spat up blood but kept his composure.
0,"He was a soldier, a special operative personally trained by Jethro."
0,"By life or death, he would complete his mission."
0,Wind and fire channeled into each hand.
0,Fect expelled a large funnel of flame that burnt everything within sight until shivers stronger than the cold racked his body.
0,The guard rolled from his hiding place behind the burnt sofa and flailed on the ground in a wailing inferno before falling immobile.
0,"From outside, another guard called out."
0,There was one more.
0,Fect could barely keep himself steady.
0,"He had to get the portal closed before that final guard saw it, before he collapsed from injury and exhaustion into death."
0,He ran back into the kitchen and was about to run into the portal but noticed one of the small projectile weapons lying on the floor.
0,He grabbed it before diving into the portal.
0,"Chapter 6
“A more powerful form of teleportation.”
Jethro"
1,“Close the portal now!” 
0,"Fect appeared from the black abyss and landed at Jethro’s feet, blood spitting from his mouth as he screamed."
0,Jethro immediately closed the portal and opened another.
0,He reached his arm in and pulled out a female High Elf slave.
0,“Treat him.
0,Quickly!”
0,The slave overcame her surprise and knelt next to Fect to begin sealing the wounds but stopped.
0,“There is something foreign inside.
0,I am in need of a knife.”
0,Jethro removed the knife from his belt and handed it to the High Elf.
0,She skillfully cut in and dug out two metal pellets from Fect’s leg and shoulder.
0,"The one in his stomach was far more difficult, but with the aid of life magic, the invasive procedure was successful."
0,"She stopped the bleeding and mended the fatal damage to Fect’s stomach, saving his life."
0,Fect stared blankly up at the intricately carved and painted ceiling of the large council room of the palace.
0,"The pain of the emergency operation had exhausted him, and his eyes were half glazed over."
0,"Jethro looked down at the pale minum, worried that Fect would be incapable of reporting what happened on the other side."
0,Never had any of his men returned from the other world so terribly injured.
0,It was then that he noticed the strange but almost familiar object in the minum’s hand.
0,The source of the wounds became clear.
0,He picked up the weapon and admired it but took care not to touch the trigger.
0,"It was crude in design, almost rustic, like a relic of ancient history."
0,He aimed at the headboard of one of the balcony seats and fired.
0,"The High Elf yelped, and the two nearby human soldiers started at the noise."
0,The wood splintered just off from where he had aimed.
0,“A physical projectile handgun.
0,"So, they do not have magic but have technology like this.” He set the weapon on the arm of the throne and knelt beside Fect."
0,“What happened?”
0,"After a few pats on the cheek, weak life returned to Fect’s eyes."
0,"He looked at Jethro, finally remembering why he was here."
0,He shot up to a sitting position and spat out the blood that pooled in his mouth.
0,"“The princess, was the mission successful?!"
0,Did you capture her?!”
0,“That is what I would like to ask you.
0,What happened?”
0,Fect slouched as though Jethro’s words cut the final strings supporting him.
0,"“As I thought… They failed…” After a deep, painful breath, Fect elaborated."
0,“The Doppelganger located the princess.
0,Mordok ordered my squad to aid in her capture.
0,"She sent the princess to us, but I fell injured at the beginning of the fight."
0,I woke in a medical facility and had to fight my way out.
0,"I escaped back to the base, but they knew I would return there."
0,Someone was informing them.
0,I fear that it may have been the princess.”
0,"Or the Doppelganger, Jethro thought."
0,"While Jethro had hoped that the Doppelganger would be cooperative, he only had faith in her inborn desire as a Doppelganger to replace the princess to prevent her from running or crossing him."
0,"Sending the princess to his men was a surprise, and betrayal was always a possibility; however, even if she did betray him, he was no worse off than being without her help."
0,"In fact, she proved very useful in confirming the princess resided in the city, and she may still prove useful in the future."
0,“That means the princess remains in the city.
0,"She has not moved on,” Jethro stated for confirmation."
0,"“Yes, at the educational institution from what Austin told the Doppelganger."
0,We thought the city unarmed.
0,We were wrong.
0,They have weapons.
0,I was lucky not to be killed by them.
0,I almost was killed by them…” Fect’s eyes fell to the floor.
0,"“Which would you say is more powerful, our magic and weaponry or their weaponry alone?”"
0,“Those I fought were only city guards.
0,I saw much larger of those strange weapons.
0,"If they had power to match their size, I would not have survived being shot once."
0,They also control the skies.
0,One had some sort of flying… thing.” Fect’s eyes shot up at Jethro showing the disbelief in his own words.
0,"“It was not a creature, but one of their carriages hovering in the air!”"
0,“They have even developed air travel far enough to produce machinery capable of suspending itself in flight.
0,This world is far more advanced that I formerly thought.”
0,A bit of worry crossed Jethro’s mind.
0,Fect was badly injured and had stated that he fought with city guards.
0,“Did the guards see the portal?
0,Do they know we come from another world?”
0,Fect stayed silent at first but responded after another breath.
0,“I killed all the guards near the portal.
0,"I do not think that anyone else saw it, but there was one more guard approaching."
0,"I had no confidence I could kill him with my injuries, so I prioritized reporting to you over making certain I was not seen."
0,"He was well out of sight of the portal when I entered, but I do not know if he saw it before it closed.”"
0,"The young minum prepared to receive punishment for potentially revealing a vital secret to the other world, but Jethro had no desire to punish him."
0,Fect was able to make the best decision in such a short time during an emergency.
0,This showed a level of judgement that Jethro hated to admit most of his soldiers lacked.
0,Revealing that he and his men were from another world was worth knowing that the princess was still in the city.
0,There was always the possibility that the princess already informed the city as such.
0,Fect weighted his priorities correctly.
0,"Jethro was already preparing Fect for a position as a commanding officer of his army, following after Fect’s father, but perhaps he could go even further."
0,He decided to discuss Fect’s potential with the generals at a later date depending on Fect’s future achievements.
0,"“I do not feel we can be secret about our desires to find the princess any longer,” Fect said."
0,"“They know we are there, and they have seen our magic."
0,"If the princess really did side with the city, I feel they have become our enemy."
0,They will be ready for us next time.”
0,"“If we want to find the princess, then sending only a handful of men through a stationary portal will be of little use from here on out,” Jethro mused."
0,“I believe so.”
0,Jethro lifted the minum and placed him in the arms of the High Elf slave.
0,“See to his full recovery.
0,"Fect, I will have need of you again soon, so rest well."
0,"Know that I am proud of what you have accomplished, and you will be rewarded accordingly.”"
0,"Once the slave carried Fect away, Jethro dismissed the two soldiers with him and slouched back into the throne."
0,"“So, that location has been compromised."
0,"Assuming Eydis would not abandon the city knowing we are there… No, she would not abandon it."
0,"She would stay to protect it, and if the Doppelganger is still alive, she would remain there as well because Eydis is there."
0,"Both of them, and now with the addition of the city guard, they will be far more vigilant.”"
0,"Jethro exhaled a large sigh, but it was not one of frustration."
0,A small smile spread on his lips.
0,Things were becoming entertaining.
0,“Time to pay Emer another visit.”
0,"He grabbed the handgun, placed it in his belt, and opened a portal back to the Tolmyur Kingdom."
1,The portal exited into a dimly lit stone corridor.
0,The torches on the walls were small and spaced far enough apart to provide only the minimum light required to see.
0,The air was humid despite the chill and carried the sour odor of mildew.
0,The old wooden door next to him was growing moss.
0,"Despite the appearance, Prison Fort Tammonurk on the norther tip of the Tolmyur Kingdom was among the finest in the kingdom."
0,"If Jethro had sent Emer to a lesser prison, Emer might not have lasted."
0,"He could have kept Emer in the palace, but the humidity of this location was ideal."
0,Jethro unlatched and opened the door to the small room.
0,"It contained a molding bed mat made of course fabric stuffed with straw, a small table with parchment and an ink well with a quill, a single chair next to the table, and a brazier by the door."
0,"On the bed sat what looked like a short High Elf, but he was not alone."
0,The other resident was the reason for requiring high humidity.
0,"A rare species of ivy dryad, a kissiae named Keeya, clung to his back."
0,"After the fall of the Amelian Empire, the dryads were one of the first to submit to Jethro."
0,He ordered them to give him an able kissiae shaman in order to make use of Emer’s knowledge.
0,"Kissiae were being sheltered in the Elos marshlands of the dryad controlled territory, Dhuillir, and were few in number due to being hunted all over the world."
0,"Like all dryads, kissiae were female."
0,"The difference between a kissiae and the usual dryad breeds was that kissiae were smaller than their dryad counterparts, about the size of minums, and they were parasitic in nature."
0,They secreted a poison from their bodies that affected the minds of those who came in contact with them.
0,"With a potent enough dose, the host would become a submissive puppet to the kissiae."
0,The kissiae could then leach nutrients from the host through their skin and ivy hair.
0,"It was their manipulative power that Jethro required, but he ordered the kissiae shaman to take her domination one step further."
0,"Keeya appeared to have her legs wrapped around Emer’s exposed torso at the waistline with one hand crossing his chest and the other pressed to the side of his head, but upon closer inspection, the appendages of the Kissiae were fused with Emer’s body."
0,"Small vines and fine fibers grew from her skin and rooted into Emer’s skin and muscles, wrapping around his bones and intertwining with his internal organs."
0,"The vines of the hand fused to his head left bulging lines across his forehead, cheek, and down his neck."
0,Keeya’s body was pressed against his back but was not fused like her arms and legs.
0,The head of the kissiae that rested against Emer’s shoulder took notice of Jethro’s entrance.
0,Keeya turned to look at Jethro with her weary and slightly sunken eyes.
0,Her variegated ivy-like hair slid to one side as she lifted her head.
0,Jethro grabbed the torch outside the door and lit the brazier in the room.
0,He then returned the torch and closed the door.
0,"Keeya winced from the light of the fire, her eyes accustomed to the dark."
0,Jethro reached behind Keeya and plucked six small buds from her long ivy hair that extended down her back and coiled on the bed.
0,"Like all dryads, when their hair flowered, pollen collected and could impregnate the dryad."
0,"In her state, pregnancy was very problematic."
0,"Kissiae birthrate was extremely low, and being far from the pollen of her native ivy further decreased the chance, but a risk was a risk."
0,She watched in shame as he once again threw her budding flowers into the brazier.
0,"Jethro could not cut off her hair because removing a kissiae’s hair made them very ill, and sickness would drastically weaken her control over Emer."
0,"Because kissiae were so small, much of their body’s fluids resided in the long and thick vines of their hair."
0,To remove an adult kissiae’s hair was equivalent to removing no less than half of the life sap circulating nutrients in their body.
0,"This was a problem that kissiae life magic could not heal, so the hair must remain."
0,Jethro sat cross-legged on the chair in the room and folded his arms.
0,“Is he awake?”
0,Keeya nodded.
0,“I am awake.”
0,The voice of the man carried the monotone depression of one who had given up all hope.
0,The mind-altering drug did not remove the freedom of thought of the individual but made them unable to resist the will of the kissiae or those the kissiae wanted the host to obey.
0,"If the kissiae wanted their host to kill themselves or a loved one, they would be unable to refuse."
0,"Kissiae were hunted out of fear or to process this drug for use on slaves, prisoners, or others as a form of mind-control, leading to the kissiae’s small population."
0,"Emer was fully aware of his situation and that he was helping Jethro hunt Eydis FeAmel, but he could not refuse."
0,“What do you need me for this time?”
0,“Continuing our former discussion.
0,Circumstances arose that require me to expedite our research.
0,Have you made any progress on your end?”
0,Keeya nodded.
0,"“Yes,” Emer replied."
0,Jethro reached over and touched the hand attached to Emer’s head.
0,Keeya removed the ven trace for the spell Emer had been developing in Jethro’s absence and passed it to him.
0,"Jethro sat back and focused on reverse engineering the trace back into the teleportation formula, a trivial but time-consuming act."
0,"His hand flew over a piece of parchment on the table beside him as he drew the formula, adding notes where more explanation would be needed."
0,"Jethro considered himself a master of spatial magic and had knowledge of the capabilities of spatial magic that Emer lacked, but Emer’s understanding and ability to manipulate it was far superior."
0,Emer often had to elaborate on many key points of his formulas to help Jethro comprehend them.
0,The finished formula on the paper made Jethro’s head spin.
0,"“As expected of transmission, the ven cost is far lower, but… Hold on.”"
0,One of the sections of the formula he noted for additional explanation became clear with further inspection.
0,"“This peculiar section is for stability, correct?"
0,Transmission normally does not require stability because the portal is instantaneous and does not need to be held open.”
0,"“The transmission is not instantaneous, because the distance between worlds is so great."
0,The portal must hold long enough for the target to reach its destination.”
0,“Do you even realize what you have here?” Jethro’s heart raced in uncontainable excitement.
0,The strangely designed stability section of the formula hinted at something he formerly thought impossible.
0,Jethro grabbed another sheet of parchment and scribbled out his revelation.
0,"“Emer, what are the 3 laws of spatial teleportation?”"
0,Emer’s dead voice answered as if reciting a text.
0,"“First, the number and estimated mass of objects to be sent through the portal must be known beforehand and built into the formula, and the complexity of formula and expenditure increases exponentially with the number of objects to be sent through."
0,"Second, portals created in close proximity of either entrance or destination will fuse and collapse on each other."
0,"Third, the larger in size the portal, the more unstable and prone to collapse it is, with three jurs being the maximum possible safe diameter.”"
0,“Take a look at this.” 
0,Jethro held up the formula Emer had devised in one hand with the minor alteration Jethro had scribbled out side by side.
0,Emer opened his eyes to scan the parchment.
0,His eyes opened wider and wider.
0,"He grabbed both parchments with his one remaining hand and read them again and again, looked back at Jethro, and then read them one final time."
0,"“I was only looking for a way to use transmission to teleport to the other world, but this… THIS is groundbreaking!"
0,"You, Emer, are a wizard in every sense of the word."
0,Laws of spatial magic be damned.
0,We have our work cut out for us tonight.
0,"Keeya, if this works out, you will have some sun tomorrow, so make sure Emer is in top condition as we work.”"
0,Keeya’s eyes quickly grew attentive.
0,“Sun?” She nodded her head repeatedly.
0,"Jethro pulled the table between him and Emer, and they got to work finalizing the formula in a creative fever."
1,"Late morning after the early mist had cleared, two giant soldiers accompanied Jethro and Emer outside the fort to a vast grassy clearing dotted with a few large coniferous trees."
0,The field provided a sturdy foundation for the large fort in a territory known for its near-uninhabitable marshlands.
0,"Jethro wished that the field had been used for a village or other settlement that could make use of the small grassland for well needed crops, but due the hostile goblin domain to the north of Tolmyur, the former kings felt the strategic benefits of the fort outweighed the crops the land could provide for the starving people."
0,They stepped out from the shade of the fort into the sun.
0,"When the variegated leaves of Keeya’s hair met the radiant warmth, they shook lightly and furled out."
0,Emer broke into a sprint.
0,"The two giants were about to make chase, but Jethro called them back."
0,“There is no need.”
0,Jethro did not fear Emer fleeing.
0,"So long as the kissiae remained attached, any attempt at escape or betrayal was impossible, and he did not doubt the kissiae’s loyalty."
0,"He bested Keeya in front of the remainder of her kind in Elos, proving that he had the power to either protect them or destroy them."
0,He vowed to protect the last of the kissiae as the Amelian royalty once did if she swore her undying fealty to Jethro.
0,"This was their agreement, and Keeya would never break it."
0,"When Emer reached the center of the field where no shadows could touch him, he spun with his outstretched hand grasping at the celestial warmth."
0,He leapt with a limber step and pranced with youthful glee through the golden-brown blades of grass.
0,"With a swing of his head and a lithe twist of his hips, the verdant vines of Keeya’s hair spun in a wide fan."
0,A euphoric laugh of effeminate joy danced along the light morning breeze.
0,"The two giants watched the scene with perplexed expressions, but Jethro could only smile."
0,“Keeya seems to be enjoying herself.
0,We can let her have her fun.”
0,The feminine laugh grew to an entrancing song in a language unknown to Jethro.
0,Emer’s dance followed the rhythm of the light tune as he leapt and spun with his arm curved above his head and then unfurling to brush the leaves of Keeya’s trailing hair.
0,He arched back to fall into the golden field but turned down to his knees in a limber motion before spinning to his feet with one leg gracefully extended outwards.
0,"Another spin followed the last with his arm reaching for the sun as if trying to hold it in an embrace, just as the bewitching dance had begun."
0,"Jethro felt the scene would have been beautifully captivating if it was a woman dancing, not the grotesque fusion of dryad and elf."
0,"“Fetch a water mage,” Jethro ordered."
0,The giant on Jethro’s left jogged back to the fort and returned with an annoyed minum hanging in his grip by the back of the minum’s robe.
0,Emer had finished his dance and sat in a ball with his arms and knees tucked under him in the center of the field so that Keeya’s back faced the sun.
0,Her long ivy hair fanned out in a large circle as far as it could stretch with the plentiful variegated leaves fully opened and bathing in the sunlight.
0,Only the sage-colored skin of her back remained uncovered by her hair.
0,Jethro approached with the minum in toe.
0,"“Dampen the leaves with a little water, but not too much.”"
0,"The mage sent a mist over the ivy hair, coating the leaves in little droplets of water."
0,Keeya shivered and laughed with glee.
0,"“Why do I get the feeling that Keeya is the one being rewarded?” Emer’s voice was muffled through the dead, wet grass."
0,"“As a fellow academic, your reward will come from whether or not this experiment is a success."
0,Keeya has not seen the sun since you two met.
0,"The day is still young, so we can give Keeya her moment."
0,I do not expect her to sunbathe for long.
0,Too much sun is not healthy for her kind.”
0,"Despite Jethro’s assurance that Emer would not have his face in the ground for long, Keeya did not stop sunbathing until well past midday."
0,"The minum kept her leaves moist, and Jethro was able to enjoy an elegant lunch in the grass."
0,Emer was not able to eat until Keeya finally stood him up and walked him to the shade of the trunk of a nearby tree.
0,"Her complexion had drastically improved, her eyes were no longer sunken, and she was overall in higher spirits."
0,"Even though she could draw all her nutrients directly from Emer, she had Emer feed her small samples of the quality meal Jethro prepared of fowl and red squash accompanied by a deep purple wine made from a grain-sized black berry called kanak, native to the marshlands."
1,“Shall we?”
0,Jethro beckoned Emer to join him back in the field.
0,The two giants had prepared a set of battered target dummies staked into the ground.
0,"The first few were the size of a giant but the others were much larger, about three times the height of a giant."
0,"A minum earth mage was brought out, again hanging by the back of his robe, to dig a hole for the log-like stakes supporting them."
0,The experiments could now begin.
0,"“The smaller targets are about three jurs tall, which is the maximum width for portals."
0,"If we make it bigger, the dummy should come out damaged and the portal collapses,” Jethro explained."
0,He tore open a portal a little bigger than the first dummy with the exit far to the left of where they stood.
0,The edges of the portal wavered when he pushed it forward until the giant-sized dummy was engulfed.
0,The portal cracked and dispersed immediately after.
0,The dummy that came out the exit was fractured with a few parts missing.
0,Those parts remained at their original location.
0,"Had this been a live target, the teleportation would have been fatal."
0,"“If we increase the stability as much as possible, the portal still collapses.”"
0,"The portal Jethro sent at the next giant-sized target did not waver, but the swirl of energy surrounding it showed its instability."
0,"Once it engulfed the dummy, it collapsed, but the dummy that exited to their left was still intact with only minor damage."
0,"It would not have been fatal to a live target, but the target would still exit injured, making it impractical."
0,“A portal any larger than this would be more unstable and collapse easier.
0,Transmission has the same issue.”
0,"Jethro flicked his wrist, and a giant-sized dummy vanished with a loud crack as the surrounding air rapidly sucked inward from the void created by the missing space."
0,"It appeared on the right side of the field in a bright flash as the teleported contents rapidly forced what had occupied the space outward, and some of the grass beneath the target was blown away."
0,The target was just as tattered and damaged as the first.
0,Jethro’s transmission lacked any stability measures.
0,“This is where your genius comes in.
0,"I never included stability in the transmission formula because frankly, I could not figure out how."
0,"And due to its instantaneous nature, stability was not needed."
0,"But you, you cracked it.”"
0,Another flick of Jethro’s wrist sent the next dummy to the right side of the field with a loud crack.
0,"A little dirt and grass blew away once more in the flash of light, but the dummy appeared completely undamaged from the teleportation."
0,"“Yes!” Jethro threw his fist in the air, and Emer’s mouth hung agape."
0,“Let’s try one bigger.”
0,The next dummy to vanish was one of the larger.
0,The far greater volume of air that was sucked into the vacuum created by the suddenly missing dummy created a deafening crack the other transmissions could not even compare to.
0,"On the right side of the field, the flash was a blinding explosion that sent out a wave of heated air."
0,Jethro shielded his eyes.
0,His ears rang.
0,Debris from the ground below the destination peppered Jethro and the other observers.
0,"When the dust settled, the dummy was on its side in the small crater created by its appearance."
0,There was no damage to the dummy.
0,Jethro could hardly contain his excitement.
0,The third law of spatial teleportation had been broken by a combination of his transmission magic and Emer’s stability function.
0,It was still not perfect.
0,"Transmission could only be used on a single target near the caster, but size was no longer an issue."
0,"Now, he wanted to test its full capabilities."
0,He ordered the two giants and two minums to draw close and surrounded the group with a barrier to not only block debris but also mute outside sound and dim intense light.
0,"“You once asked how I assaulted Amel, and I explained that it was using transmission."
0,Let me give you a little demonstration.”
0,Jethro extended his hand at the remaining seven smaller dummies and four larger dummies.
0,"In rapid succession, each dummy vanished with a crack and reappeared further down the field in eleven separate explosions."
0,The undamaged dummies sat in their respective craters based on their size once the dust settled.
0,"In his adrenaline-filled excitement, Jethro pointed his hand towards the nearby tree that towered twice the height of the fort behind them."
0,"It vanished, creating a suction that threatened to pull the group, barrier and all, into the void created by the suddenly missing tree, but that suction was interrupted by a massive explosion of superheated air that blew out from the far side of the field."
0,Jethro quickly added another barrier to support the last and shield both them and the fort from the heated wave.
0,"The dust did not take long to clear, but mud continued raining from the sky long afterwards."
0,"The trees nearest to the destination bent away from the explosion, and much of the grass near the crater was burnt brown."
0,The crater itself was about as wide as the tree was tall and was filling with water from the high water table.
0,The tree leaned on the side of the crater completely undamaged aside from its roots that were severed when the transmission magic grabbed hold of it.
0,Emer was the first to walk towards the crater once Jethro’s barrier fell.
0,He stood at the edge and felt the flash-dried grass from the heated air.
0,Jethro followed not too far behind.
0,"From the fort, countless soldiers ran out in file onto the field with their weapons drawn under the command of their captains for what they assumed was an attack."
0,Jethro waved them down and sent the minums to explain the reason for the commotion before continuing towards the crater.
0,"“Jethro… I do not think that we can call this stable,” Emer said once Jethro neared."
0,"“In fact, I feel it far more unstable than normal teleportation.”"
0,“Hardly.
0,The physics behind the explosion is separate from the teleportation itself.
0,Transmission was only the catalyst.
0,We can consider this a glorious success.
0,But I must say that it is highly impractical for anything too large.” Jethro looked up at the sky.
0,“Perhaps if done in a vacuum… 
0,"In any case, this is not exactly what I was hoping for, but a success is a success."
0,"From your world to mine, we have just changed the foundation of spatial magic law!”"
0,“Will you be using this to capture Eydis?”
0,Jethro sighed.
0,"“I know we are enemies, but can you at least be a little more excited about what we just accomplished?"
0,We can save discussion about your princess for when we are back to finishing the formula for transmission to the other world.”
0,Jethro reached over Emer’s shoulder and patted Keeya on the cheek.
0,She startled awake.
0,"Immediately Emer jumped back in fright, unwillingly expressing the Kissiae’s surprise."
0,“But I am happy to know that you are an academic over anything else.
0,"Keeya passed out, so you could have escaped if you wanted to, but instead you were curious about the spell we developed.”"
0,Emer’s face froze in distress.
0,“Looks like your princess was not as important to you as you thought.
0,Shattering a law of magic that has held since the dawn of spatial magic research is far more important than a single ephemeral life.
0,"Subconsciously, you understand this."
0,Do not worry.
0,I will make sure your name is included with mine in history.” 
0,Jethro stretched his arms above his head.
0,"“We have been up all night on this, so I am going to sleep."
0,I suggest you do the same.
0,"Keeya, take him back to his room and make sure he sleeps well."
0,We will continue our research tomorrow.”
0,"Keeya eyed with confusion the destruction of the field she had just danced in, her mind still somnolent from the wine."
0,She nodded back at her master and followed him to the fort.
0,"Chapter 7
“Living in Another’s Shadow”
Eydis"
1,“What is your name?”
0,“Eydis FeAmel.”
0,"“Where are you from, Ms. FeAmel?”"
0,"“A city called Amel, the same as my name.”"
0,“Not the Amel in Belgium?”
0,“No.”
0,“Any relation to Jabal Amel in Lebanon?”
0,“No.”
0,“If you could explain where it is near to--”
0,"“You will not find the city on your maps, and I would not be able to point you to it even if I wanted to.”"
0,"The man across from Eydis wore a dark suit, a white shirt, and blue tie about his neck."
0,"He introduced himself as Jason Botteger, a member of an investigation organization, the FBI, for the nation to which this city belonged."
0,Gullivan was not a fully autonomous city-state as Eydis had originally thought.
0,"This man came to speak with her at the city guards’ request, she assumed to investigate if those who pursued her could be a threat to the nation as a whole."
0,"She anticipated and feared the detailed questions she would be asked but soon grew disappointed, almost bored, as the interviews progressed."
0,The man flipped through the small stack of paper in front of him.
0,“And your family is influential in that city?
0,"I would assume so, given your name.”"
0,"“We were the ruling family, yes.” "
0,Eydis tapped her fingers in annoyance.
0,“I do not see the reason for questioning me again.
0,"You have all my answers in those papers, do you not?"
0,"If you failed to believe me the past three times, you will not believe me now.” "
0,This FBI agent only repeated the same questions the city guard asked over the past two days.
0,“We believe you.
0,Your fingerprints matched those we found on the broken table in the field and the blades of two of the swords we recovered.
0,There is enough evidence to justify your claim that you were fighting in self-defense.
0,We just need to know your situation better so that we can help you.”
0,Eydis’s tapping fingers balled into a fist.
0,“I can tell when you are lying.
0,Your heart quickened when you spoke.
0,I could hear it.
0,"You do not believe those notes, so you are asking me again.”"
0,Agent Botteger’s eyes widened in surprise.
0,“I can assure you that we mean well.”
0,“The police said they meant well when they asked me to answer questions like my friends.
0,"When my friends were released in the evening, the police demanded I stay here."
0,"When I wanted to leave after more questioning the next day, they informed me you would arrive today to speak with me and demanded I stay again.”"
0,“That was all for your protection.” 
0,“I do not need protection.
0,Your city does.”
0,“All the more reason to cooperate with us.” 
0,Eydis sighed.
0,“We will leave the matter of whether we feel it safe for you to leave until after we better understand the situation you are in.
0,Just humor us for now.
0,The FeAmel family--”
0,"“The Amel family,” Eydis interrupted."
0,“Fe marks the first child.
0,"We ruled the city and the area around it, yes.”"
0,“So you are eldest child and heir?” 
0,The scene of the princess chained in a dark cellar flashed in Eydis’s mind.
0,“Yes.
0,"There are two younger sons, twins of a different mother."
0,They died in the attack.
0,All that information is in the notes the police gave you.”
0,“Learning about your origins will tell us more about where these terrorists are coming from.” 
0,“I told the police that as well.
0,"They come from Tolmyur, a mostly desert nation."
0,"Like Amel, you will not find it on your maps."
0,They are entering the city because you cannot stop them.
0,Read your papers.
0,You are wasting my time and yours.”
0,“Can you give detailed descriptions of the men who captured you?” 
0,“No.
0,All I knew that were in the city I killed that evening.
0,I did not see the faces of those who captured me.”
0,“Then a general description?
0,Perhaps race or ethnicity.
0,"We have the bodies, but we cannot quite discern where they come from, and that is only one of the many oddities about them.”"
0,Chloe’s concern for refugees came to Eydis’s mind.
0,Eydis did not know to what lengths this nation’s government would go to eliminate a threat.
0,"If Chloe’s warning had any weight, perhaps innocent people might be killed if wrongfully suspected."
0,“I cannot give you one.
0,I have seen some in this city who are similar enough to those of Tolmyur that providing you such a description might jeopardize their wellbeing.”
0,"“Okay, assuming these terrorists come from a place called Tolmyur, how was that one able to create fire?"
0,Does magic really exist there?”
0,The sides of Eydis’s lips curled into a smirk.
0,"“You are asking this question for yourself, not the police."
0,Let me show you.”
0,"A thin barrier surrounded Eydis just above her clothes and skin, invisible to Agent Botteger’s eyes."
0,The barrier quickly expanded.
0,"The metal chair she sat in bowed out from the pressure of the barrier, and the table in front of her pushed forcefully into Agent Botteger’s stomach."
0,"He lurched forward in shock, both from surprise and from the impact."
0,“There is your proof.” Eydis ignored the dazed stare and walked to the door.
0,“I will be in my room.”
1,The police left Eydis alone for the remainder of the afternoon.
0,"They provided her a small room containing no more than a bed, cushioned chair, and side table."
0,"Even though the police expressed a slight hint of hospitality in the arrangement, the bed and chair were of lower quality than those in Justin’s apartment."
0,"The bed was also too short, leaving her feet to dangle off the end."
0,"There was no doubt in her mind that this was a provisional prison cell in guise of a guest room, that they were confining her until they decided what to do with her."
0,Why did I trust Justin?
0,"Now that this city’s guards know I can do the same as Jethro’s men, they view me as just as dangerous."
0,"“Then again, he had no idea that his city saved one of Jethro’s men.” A melancholy breath escaped Eydis’s lips."
0,Why must this be so troublesome?
0,Why could I not live with Sammy and Justin and not worry about Jethro or anyone else?
0,The princess lived such a carefree life here.
0,“Why can I not live just as happily in this city as well?”
1,Evening came before Eydis received any visitors.
0,"A light knock on her door announced the arrival of a female officer, Joyce Hellings."
0,"She did not wait for Eydis to answer before entering, perhaps taking Eydis’s silence as permission."
0,This was not the first time.
0,She reminded Eydis of Jethro.
0,"He never announced his arrivals, so Eydis was forced to assume he would arrive at any moment to prevent unwanted or embarrassing situations."
0,"Every time Eydis saw Officer Hellings, she could not help but think Joyce looked smug with her blond hair pulled back into a bun so tight it pulled at the skin of her face."
0,Officer Hellings brought Eydis to a small meeting room where Major Wickenny and Agent Botteger sat waiting.
0,"Eydis took her seat across from them, and then Officer Hellings sat beside her."
0,The file containing all the information Eydis told the police sat on the table in front of Major Wickenny.
0,“Am I to be questioned a fourth time?” Eydis folded her arms and breathed a sigh of boredom.
0,She slouched in her seat with her eyes closed to await the coming questions.
0,"“No, we feel that we have enough for now.”"
0,Eydis opened one weary eye to look at Major Wickenny.
0,He just lied.
0,They obviously wanted to know more but did not know how to make her talk.
0,She would willingly tell them more if she did not believe doing so would ruin her chances of a peaceful life in this city.
0,Telling them she was from another world was the same as betraying her dream of a peaceful life.
0,"Revealing magic to them already caused no shortage of distrust, leading to her confinement over the past few days."
0,“I will move straight to the point.
0,We have discussed the information you have given us in light of the events surrounding the fight you were involved in and the man who could use fire magic that disappeared.”
0,"Both of Eydis’s eyes opened, now wary about what decision the city guard came to."
0,"“We feel it too dangerous to keep you in the city,” Agent Botteger continued for Major Wickenny."
0,“We have victim protection and relocation programs in this nation and would like to provide you that service until the terrorist situation is resolved.
0,"We have contacted Fort Samper, an Army base about two hundred miles south of here and explained the situation to them."
0,They will give Gullivan their support in routing out the terrorists as well as protecting you until more permanent accommodations can be made.”
0,“Army?” Eydis asked.
0,"“The Army is a branch of our country’s military,” Agent Botteger replied."
0,"First they keep me prisoner in the city, and now they plan on keeping me captive by their military?"
0,"There was no way that she could leave the city behind, especially with both Rynn and the princess here."
0,"She could teleport back and forth, but responding to emergencies would be far more difficult if she was not present to react to them immediately."
0,"And being under constant watch at the human’s military base would be no different than her situation under Jethro, possibly even preventing her from freely returning to Rynn."
0,At least the room Jethro provided was regal because the palace became his base.
0,This country’s military could never provide similar accommodations.
0,“I refuse.”
0,"“Mr. Botteger informed me that you were under the impression that we were confining you here,” Major Wickenny replied."
0,"“If we made you feel that way, I apologize."
0,That was not our intent.
0,I never considered that you might think our requests were demands.
0,We requested your cooperation because we want to protect you and the people of this city.”
0,Eydis laughed within herself.
0,"Even though Major Wickenny was not lying, he was likely not telling the whole truth either."
0,Humans could not be trusted.
0,"“We, the police, need to prioritize the safety of the citizens, and the Department of Justice will prioritize your protection."
0,"If more people with such destructive power are in the city and you are their primary target, removing you from the city is the best decision for everyone.”"
0,"As Eydis expected, they did not care about her feelings on the matter."
0,"They would exploit her for the benefit of their people, just as Jethro had."
0,Eydis’s hands balled into fists.
0,She gritted her teeth and glared at Major Wickenny.
0,“I will not become a war prisoner again!”
0,Officer Hellings placed her hand on Eydis’s balled fist.
0,“You are not going to be a prisoner.
0,You can receive better protection at Fort Samper.”
0,“All I want is to live a normal life here in Gullivan.” 
0,Major Wickenny lightly waved his hand to drawn Eydis’s attention back to him.
0,“These arrangements will only be temporary.
0,"Once the terrorists are dealt with, you will be free to live as you please.”"
0,“And how long will that take?
0,You do not know these people like I do.
0,Their tenacity knows no limits.”
0,"“All the more reason for you to take us up on the offer,” Agent Botteger replied."
0,“We cannot protect you well if you wander about the city freely.”
0,“I cannot be free?
0,Then that makes me no different than a prisoner.
0,I refuse.
0,I only stayed here because Justin asked me to help you.
0,"Now that you have decided and have no more questions, I am leaving.”"
0,Agent Botteger shook his head.
0,“I beg you reconsider.
0,I will be upfront with you.
0,"The existence of magic has created a complicated situation for the police, the FBI, and the Department of Justice as a whole."
0,"The bodies we found look normal, but the autopsies revealed a lot about them that is, frankly, inhuman."
0,We don’t know if that is because of their magic abilities or not or why else they are so different.
0,"There is much more that we need to know, and to better deal with this threat, I need you to cooperate with me.”"
0,"Heat rose in Eydis’s chest, and she fought to suppress her anger to prevent her eyes from changing color to a deep Lurr red."
0,"After a broken and frustrated breath, she spoke."
0,“Do you think you can force me to go?
0,I am not your enemy.
0,Do not make me one.”
0,Eydis stood from her chair.
0,"Officer Hellings followed, so Eydis placed her hand on the woman’s shoulder and pushed her back down into her chair with her far superior strength."
0,“Do not come too close or you will be hurt.”
0,"Without another word, Eydis activated the transmission spell she had saved for the entirety of her confinement by the police."
0,Those in the room could do nothing but stare with gawking faces at the empty space where Eydis once stood.
1,Eydis appeared in the cellar of Rynn’s house in the southeast corner of the city.
0,The princess lay on her side on a blanket with a towel draped over her.
0,"The color of the princess’s face was slightly better than it had been in the past, but she remained unconscious."
0,"Eydis was unsure where or how the police were watching her, so she had not risked returning to feed over the past two days."
0,"After feeding a little more than usual as a reward to herself for calmly enduring the police’s interrogations, she walked up the stairs with a refreshed smile on her face."
0,Rynn was there to greet her with teary eyes in the bedroom.
0,“Sorry I could not come back and visit.
0,I was held for questioning by the town guards.
0,Did I worry you?”
0,Rynn nodded.
0,"Eydis knew her sudden unannounced disappearance for a few days would worry Rynn, especially after only just contacting the princess’s associates."
0,"For all Eydis knew, Rynn might have thought the infiltration failed and that Eydis was captured or killed."
0,“Those foolish guards saved the life of a minum I failed to kill.
0,"He escaped after killing many guardsmen and civilians, so they demanded I tell them everything I knew."
0,The guards were persistent.
0,"I am the one being targeted, or so they believe, but they still had the audacity to treat me like some war criminal.” "
0,Eydis grabbed one of the many dried flatbreads from the bedside table and handed it to Rynn to rehydrate.
0,“They wanted to take me captive to their military base!
0,Can you believe that?”
0,“Are they our enemies now?” 
0,"Rynn returned the now softened bread, surprising Eydis by how fast and skillful Rynn’s magic was when it came to food."
0,“I do not think so.
0,Not yet.
0,"If they are competent, they will realize that I am stronger than all of them."
0,They have seen the aftermath of the battle.
0,"If they could not kill even one injured minum, how could they confine someone who killed many men just as strong or stronger?"
0,"And now that they know I can teleport, their plan to keep me captive is ruined."
0,"They do not like me being here, but that will be the extent of it.”"
0,"Eydis sat on the edge of the bed, and Rynn sat beside, leaning against her."
0,“Making me an enemy is suicide for them.
0,"Of course, I do not want to fight them either."
0,I made it clear to them that I intend to live a peaceful life here.
0,But still…”
0,That dream of a peaceful life was moving closer and closer to becoming nothing more than a dream.
0,"The minum disappeared, so the only explanation was that he went into hiding until Jethro opened another portal."
0,Perhaps the minum already returned and informed Jethro that their plan to capture the princess failed.
0,"If Jethro assumed that Eydis was still alive, he would conclude that she either escaped or was helping the princess."
0,"Either way, he would not leave her alone."
0,Replacing the princess.
0,Being treated as a threat by the city guard.
0,Becoming a new target for Jethro.
0,The number of trials barring her from a peaceful and happy life was only increasing.
0,“What’s wrong?” 
0,Rynn leaned forward to look up into Eydis’s eyes.
0,“Nothing.
0,Just one thing piling upon another.
0,I am a little frustrated.
0,That is all.” 
0,Eydis pulled Rynn into a full embrace before setting her back down on the bed.
0,“I must be going.
0,I am sure the city guard will be coming to Justin now that I disappeared.
0,"If I am not there, that will cause more trouble for him, and thus me.”"
0,"Rynn nodded, and Eydis teleported back to her room in Justin’s apartment."
0,Rynn was left alone on the bed with the flatbread she rehydrated only nibbled on.
1,No one was home.
0,"For how late in the evening, this was odd."
0,"From her observations of Justin’s daily schedule in order to formulate a plan to capture the princess, Justin was only out this late when he was with Eydis at her magic lessons, and there would be no reason for him to be training because she was with the city guard."
0,“Where is he?”
0,Eydis sat on the couch and waited.
0,"Time passed, but neither Justin nor Sean returned."
0,"Despite her earlier concern, the city guard did not arrive at the apartment either."
0,"Staying idle afforded her nothing, so Eydis decided to take the time to familiarize herself with the apartment."
0,"The princess knew where everything was, so Eydis should know as well."
0,"Starting from the kitchen and moving to the living room, bathroom, and eventually her bedroom, she inscribed to memory the objects she found and their names if they had one printed even if she was unsure what the object was or its use."
0,Sean’s bedroom was the only location she felt no need to investigate.
0,"The princess’s relationship with Sean was not one where she would be familiar with his belongings, or so she assumed."
0,Eydis had the time to comb through the apartment three times before the front door finally opened.
0,"Eydis was in her room, so she rushed out only to find Sean returning."
0,The corner of her mouth twisted downward in frustration.
0,Sean looked at her with a hint of surprise.
0,“When did you get back?”
0,"Even though Sean could not know that the police planned to make Eydis a prisoner of war, the lack of concern on his face for the two days she had been imprisoned at the guard station flared up anger inside her."
0,"Sean had amiable ties with the city guard, so he would not question any decision they made."
0,There was even the possibility that he would help them capture her if needed.
0,Sean was someone Eydis could not trust.
0,“Where is Justin?” She asked.
0,“He is still out with Sammy right now.
0,"He should be back in another hour or so, probably.”"
0,Justin spent the evening with another one of his women now that Eydis was away.
0,That was to be expected.
0,Eydis sighed.
0,Growing accustomed to being with a man who had multiple women would take time.
0,"Having a home large enough for all of them to live together would make his life much easier than having to go to them, but they were all independent, and he did not seem to have wealth enough for his own house."
0,He was boarding with Sean after all.
0,“I will be in my room.
0,Tell Justin I am here when you see him.”
0,Eydis returned down the hallway.
0,She closed herself in her room and curled up on her bed.
1,"Just as Sean had predicted, Justin returned promptly."
0,He opened Eydis’s bedroom door with Sammy in tow.
0,"In stark contrast to Sean’s lack of concern, both Justin and Sammy were elated that Eydis had returned."
0,“Is everything alright?
0,What happened?
0,How did it go?” 
0,Justin’s immediate questions of concern helped lift Eydis’s spirits.
0,“They held me in a single room and only let me out to ask the same questions they asked many times before.
0,"They did not believe me, so they had someone from your government come ask the same questions again.”"
0,“What did you tell them?” Justin asked.
0,Eydis rolled over to better look at the two of them.
0,"Sammy had knelt next to the bed, her worried face only inches away."
0,“Only what I told you about Jethro.
0,Do not worry.
0,"I kept to the story about them being terrorists, for that is what they are, and I did not speak anything of Whinhlem.”"
0,"“I’m glad they finally let you go,” Sammy said, slightly exasperated."
0,“Two days is a long time to hold an innocent victim.”
0,"“They weren’t holding her,” Justin countered."
0,"“When I called, they said Eydis agreed to stay and help.”"
0,Eydis grew irritated.
0,"Although she did agree to stay, their offer was certainly a demand, even if they lacked the means to force her compliance."
0,She thought that Justin would have been a bit more concerned over the confinement of his princess instead of blindly trusting the city guard.
0,"“I at least wish they would have contacted us when they let you go,” Sammy said, ignoring Justin."
0,Eydis shook her head.
0,“They did not let me go.
0,I escaped.
0,They see me as evil because of those who are after me and want to take me prisoner to some place called Fort Samper.”
0,Concern grew on Justin’s face.
0,“Prisoner?
0,That can’t be right.”
0,"“I have never heard of Fort Samper,” Sammy added."
0,"If Sammy had never heard of that location, was it real?"
0,Where were the guards planning to take me?
0,"Justin ran out of the room, leaving Eydis and Sammy in silence, but he was only gone a moment."
0,"“According to Sean, Fort Samper is an Army base south of here."
0,"A military base would be the ideal location to protect you,” Justin said when he returned."
0,“Not you as well…” 
0,"Eydis buried her face in her blanket, prompting Sammy to punch Justin in the leg."
0,"“Did you not learn from the last time,” she chided."
0,Justin immediately shook his head and corrected himself.
0,“I’m not saying you should go there.
0,I don’t want you to leave.
0,You just came back to us.
0,I was just trying to think of why they would send you there.” Justin leaned over the side of the bed.
0,"“And you said it yourself, right?"
0,"If we take you out of the city, Jethro will only become more dangerous.”"
0,"“Still, it annoys me that they would try to take you away without even contacting us first."
0,What are the police thinking?”
0,“They did not try.
0,"They told me of their plan, and I escaped before they could."
0,"They saw me teleport, so they should know now that they cannot keep me prisoner.”"
0,Sammy smiled.
0,"“Basically, you need to be willing before they can do anything to you."
0,I bet that made them squirm.”
0,Justin looked at Sammy with suspect.
0,“Do you hate the police or something?”
0,“It’s not that I hate them.
0,I just don’t really trust them.”
0,Eydis loved Sammy even more after hearing she shared a mutual distrust of the city guard.
0,"“Think about it,” Sammy continued."
0,“This is something that they have never encountered before.
0,They shouldn’t have rules or procedures for handling magic-using terrorists.
0,This means that they might decide to do something unconventional or that breaches normal police conduct.”
0,"Sammy’s warning mirrored what that FBI agent said at the end, worrying Eydis."
0,"“I doubt they would do anything rash.”  Justin did not sound convinced of his own words, and that made Eydis worry more."
1,"* * *
Eydis was unsure what procedures the city guard followed in this world, but the involvement of the police began the very next morning."
0,Sammy once again stayed the night and shared Eydis’s bed.
0,"When the three of them were about to leave for the university, there was a knock on the door."
0,Two police arrived to request that Eydis return to the station stating that there was much that the police and FBI still wanted to know.
0,"“You came to your decision, did you not?"
0,I will not let you take me prisoner.
0,I have told you all I can.
0,It is now your job to protect the city.”
0,Eydis did not wait for a reply.
0,"She used the formula destination she had memorized in preparation for the day she captured the princess, reformulated it, and tore open a portal."
0,She pulled Sammy and Justin through and glared at the stunned faces on the other side of the portal as she closed it.
0,Justin and Sammy were likewise stunned.
0,"From their reaction, they had never been taken through a portal before."
0,Sammy looked around at the shrubs and red-brick structure beside her.
0,"There was no one around the back side of the building where they exited, so she jumped down from the elevated garden to the grass for a better view the structure."
0,“This is the Wilks Math Building.
0,We are on campus?”
0,Justin hopped down and extended his hand to help Eydis.
0,"“I did not want the police following us,” Eydis explained."
0,“That’s amazing!
0,Why have we never done this before?”
0,"“What if someone saw us,” Justin retorted."
0,"“If someone saw us teleporting around, it would cause problems."
0,And can’t some of the people from her world feel when spatial magic is used?”
0,"Eydis was amazed at Justin’s understanding of the dangers of spatial magic when one desired to remain hidden, but this understanding might also come from being a rare affinity user himself."
0,"Time magic could be felt by those sensitive to it, same as spatial magic."
0,"Justin looked at Eydis for confirmation, so she nodded."
0,“I do not teleport often for that reason.
0,This time was special.
0,"The more those police realize they cannot hold me, the better.”"
1,"The following days, the police did not confront Justin and Eydis personally, but she noticed them monitoring from a distance, particularly in keeping an eye on their neighborhood and adding foot patrols on campus."
0,"Such precautions were justifiable, so Eydis did not mind at first until she noticed some people acting peculiar in her presence."
0,"They were not uniformed like the police, but after the number of days she spent at the station, she had grown accustomed to how the city guards carried themselves, their mannerisms and quirks."
0,"Even though they behaved casual, it felt to her like an act, lacking the air of natural realism emitted by everyone else."
0,"Every one of her senses told her that these plain-clothed individuals were police, or possibly members of that investigation agency."
0,"Eydis decided to join Justin in his lectures instead of joining Sammy’s company, and once she saw that self-same individual also join in the lecture, she asked Justin about him, bringing up her concern."
0,“Never seen him before in class.
0,Might be an undercover police.”
0,"“They can’t do anything to you,” Sammy said to Eydis after Eydis noticed that self-same individual in Sammy’s lecture the following day."
0,"“Now that I know of them, I cannot relax,” Eydis admitted."
0,"She found speaking her honest feelings to Sammy surprisingly easy, possibly because she still felt a likeness of Rynn in Sammy."
0,"“I know it’s for your protection, but they could lay off a little.”"
0,"“I do not need protection, and they know this."
0,They do not trust me and are watching for when I give them reason to think I am an enemy.” 
0,An extra set of observing eyes is not what Eydis wanted.
0,Living as the princess was already difficult enough.
0,Sammy noticed Eydis’s growing discomfort and quickly grew just as irritated with the police.
1,"“Could you leave us alone,” Sammy called out to the police who stood in the corner of the commons the following day."
0,"No police or campus security was ever posted in the commons, and this one just happened to arrive once Sammy invited everyone to eat lunch together."
0,"“That’s not going to do anything,” Miriam said, absentmindedly twisting her plastic fork into her polystyrene takeout box."
0,"“If they can’t hold Eydis anywhere, all they can do is watch her.”"
0,“Eydis is not the problem!” 
0,"“No, but Jethro’s men are after her, so the best option is to follow her and react to anything that happens.”"
0,“Who’s side are you on?” 
0,Miriam pointed at Eydis with her fork.
0,"“Hers, of course."
0,I’m just saying that it’s the best course of action for them.”
0,A whispering group of students passed the table eyeing Eydis and the police officer standing about twenty feet away.
0,Another two female students approached the table immediately after.
0,"“Eydis, is it true that the police are following you?"
0,I heard that you were a witness in a major crime and that they are protecting you to make sure no one tries to silence you.”
0,Eydis’s eyes narrowed.
0,"Of course some would make the connection between Eydis’s disappearance and reappearance and the sudden increase of security on campus, especially given the bloody fight outside the city."
0,“What kind of excuse is that?
0,"Kim, do you really think that anyone could kill Eydis?” Sammy replied with mild exasperation."
0,"These two girls seemed to know Eydis, and Sammy even replied to one by name."
0,Perhaps these two were the princess’s students.
0,“Then why are the police following you?
0,Are you going to come back to the self-defense class?” 
0,"Eydis’s assumption was validated, so she felt safe replying."
0,“Sorry.
0,"I do not want to put any of you in danger, so I will not go back.”"
0,“It is something that dangerous?” 
0,"“Eydis, don’t make the rumors worse!” Sammy chided."
0,"Eydis was tired of dodging questions, but Sammy was right, even if not for the same reasons she was telling Eydis to stop."
0,"The city guards wanted to monitor Eydis’s movements, but it came with an unintended side effect."
0,"The rumors spread further, and the number of people who came to Eydis grew until she no longer had any time alone with Sammy or Justin while at the university."
0,"Eydis did not know their names or anything about them, so any conversation involving such people was a risk to her identity."
0,"Being unable to talk with any of the students without fear of making a mistake, Eydis could only make one decision."
1,“I will no longer accompany you to the university.”
0,"Eydis expected Justin to protest, but he only looked at Eydis’s crestfallen face with understanding."
0,"“Keep your smartphone on you in case of emergencies, but I’m sure you can handle yourself.”"
0,"After a nod from Eydis, Justin left her in the apartment."
0,Eydis remained in her room throughout the morning until she heard Sean talking with someone in the living room.
0,She peeked out from the hallway to find that Sean had let one of the police inside.
0,The guard noticed her and stood.
0,Eydis did not give the police the opportunity to speak.
0,"Using a transmission formula she had prepared for such an occasion, the guard vanished with a loud crack."
0,“What did you do!?
0,He was only here to talk!”
0,“I sent him into the river just outside the apartment.” 
0,“The river?
0,What if he drowns?”
0,“What good is a guard in a city with a river if that guard cannot swim?” 
0,"“This is very unlike you,” Sean yelled as he rushed out the door."
0,“And what do you know of me!?”
0,Eydis vanished from the apartment.
1,She sat alone in the basement cellar near the burning furnace until Rynn walked down the steps to care for the unconscious princess.
0,Eydis’s fingernails clawed grooves in the paved floor as she drew her hands into fists.
0,The impact of her fist into the floor left a fractured indent.
0,“I want to kill every last one of the police!”
0,Rynn approached meekly and rested her arms around Eydis’s neck.
0,“Will you?”
0,“Then my life here would truly be over.
0,Information spreads fast in this world.” Eydis hugged Rynn in return.
0,"“Until something is done about Jethro, I feel the guards will not leave me alone.”"
0,Her eyes fell upon the unconscious princess.
0,Maybe I should give her to Jethro.
0,Maybe then I will be free.
0,"The very thought of giving Jethro, the one who fed Rynn to slavery and abuse, what he wanted swelled a storm of anger in Eydis that threatened to lash out indiscriminately at the nearest available target."
0,"Rynn sensed her rage and held Eydis tighter, nuzzling the side of Eydis’s head with her cheek."
0,Eydis resisted her anger and fought to calm down.
0,"Only Rynn, the princess, or she could be the target of her rage."
0,She had no choice but to suppress it.
0,"The surging frustration and anger took long to subside, but Rynn held Eydis through it."
0,“Thank you.” 
0,Eydis brushed Rynn’s hair behind her ear and rested her hand on the girl’s cheek.
0,“I should return.”
0,Rynn nodded and stood up.
0,"After one final embrace, Eydis tore open a portal to her room and stepped through."
1,"On the desk, her smartphone was buzzing."
0,"Eydis picked it up and slid the green circle on the bottom to the right to answer the phone, something that she had learned from watching Sammy and Justin."
0,“Eydis!
0,Finally you pick up.
0,What happened?
0,Sean called and said something was wrong with you.”
0,Eydis had only just calmed down and now struggled to keep her anger from resurfacing.
0,“Everything is fine.
0,I only sent away a police that Sean let in the apartment.”
0,“Sean told me you sent him into the river.” 
0,"“It was shallow where I sent him,” she replied."
0,She was not in the mood to be chastised by Justin after already being yelled at by Sean.
0,"“Sean said that they could legally arrest you for that, but I guess they couldn’t hold you no matter what they tried.” Justin paused for a moment."
0,"“Should I come back,” he asked in a soft tone."
0,Justin’s earnest concern helped calm Eydis’s anger.
0,She sat down on her bed and grew a faint smile.
0,“No.
0,I am fine.
0,"You have your work to do, so do not worry yourself.”"
0,“As long as you are sure.
0,Call me if anything else happens.”
0,“I will.” 
0,Eydis pressed the red circle to end the call and then lay back on her bed.
0,Sean is starting to doubt me.
0,I need to be more careful.
0,At least I have Sammy and Justin on my side.
1,"That evening, Sammy arrived before Justin."
0,"Justin had sent a text message stating that he was going to run a few errands, including shopping, and asked if Eydis wanted to join, but Eydis declined."
0,Sammy then volunteered to keep her company.
0,Eydis told Sammy about the events earlier that day which caused Sammy to break into a fit of laughter.
0,“Serves them right!”
0,Eydis was happy to have an ally in Sammy.
0,They continued talking throughout the afternoon and the topic of Sammy’s relationship with Justin came up.
0,"From what Eydis could glean from the broken stories and assumptions about what Sammy had already told the princess in the past and thus left out of her current retelling, Sammy was Justin’s first woman, and the princess was his second."
0,"This further frustrated Eydis because this meant that even after meeting the princess, he still sought out two more women despite not having the ability to house and care for the two he already had."
0,"Sammy left out any mention of her and Justin’s love life, and most of the stories were complaints."
0,"Eydis found it hard to believe that such a relationship was thriving, but within all the complaints was something subtle."
0,"While talking of Justin, Sammy always smiled, even if faint during her complaints."
0,"When some of the more endearing stories came up, Sammy’s heartrate increased and her body warmed."
0,The womanly scent on her grew slightly more prevalent.
0,There was no doubt that Sammy cared deeply for Justin.
0,"No matter how much Sammy tried to hide it behind snide remarks, sarcasm, and insults, her body could not lie to Eydis’s keen senses."
0,"If Justin could muster such fidelity in a woman despite the number of flaws she openly pronounced about him, maybe he was not such a bad male."
0,"“So, what about you?” "
0,Sammy’s question caught Eydis off guard.
0,"“I have been holding back asking you, but after all this, you owe me a little."
0,What do you think of him?
0,You’ve been living with him for almost half a year now.”
0,Eydis remained silent.
0,This was a conversation that she feared.
0,She knew nothing of Justin and the princess’s relationship outside of what little she could see during her time observing them.
0,“I… I do not want to answer.”
0,A mischievous grin grew on Sammy’s face.
0,“Come on.
0,Spill it.
0,"I mean, I can already piece most of it together from how I see you two act, but I want to hear it from you.”"
0,How would the princess respond?
0,"She tried to kill me to keep me from him, so she clearly cares for him."
0,"His scent is all over her bed, but I do not know the extent of their relationship."
0,"Sammy never told any stories about sex, so she is probably not looking for those at least."
0,"No, what if the three of them had sex together?"
0,Then she would know the princess and Justin’s relationship far more intimately.
0,"If I say something wrong, then she would know I am not the princess."
0,"But if Sammy knows the relationship between Justin and the princess intimately, then why is she asking?"
0,Unless the princess is not one to openly express her personal feelings?
0,I cannot make any assumptions about that either…
0,Eydis’s mind circled around concern after concern.
0,There was no way for her to answer without fear of bringing suspicion upon herself.
0,"“I am sorry, but please do not ask me,” Eydis said in the end."
0,Sammy’s face grew an exaggerated pout but she did not press further.
0,She immediately changed the subject.
0,"Now that doubt stirred in Eydis’s mind, she grew cautious over anything she said or answer she gave."
0,"When the topic moved to Sammy’s swim class and lecture of some unknown biological subject that was far beyond what Eydis’s English comprehension could follow, she closed up like a clam hiding from the breaking waves of Sammy’s discourse."
0,"The more Sammy spoke, the more Eydis could no longer reply."
0,She could play no other role than a wall for Sammy to speak at.
0,The gap in her knowledge of the princess’s past was never more apparent than it was now.
0,Pain grew inside Eydis’s chest when she realized that she could not get close to Sammy without bridging that knowledge gap--an impossible task.
0,The ally that she thought she had was now beyond arm’s reach.
0,Sammy noticed the growing depression in Eydis’s demeanor and ended her rambling.
0,She thanked Eydis for spending time together and a promised to come visit again before leaving the room to go talk with Justin who had long since returned but was kept out of the room by Sammy’s orders.
0,Sammy left the apartment after a few kind parting words.
0,Eydis was then left alone on the bed.
0,What am I to do?
0,I can no longer go to the university with Justin.
0,Sean thinks I am not acting as the princess would act.
0,"And now, I can no longer talk with Sammy."
0,Justin entered the room and sat back against the side of the bed.
0,"He said nothing, only grasping Eydis’s hand to reassure her that everything was alright, but she could find no comfort in it."
0,What if I say something that makes Justin doubt me as well?
0,"Chapter 8
Justin
“A School of Combat Magic”"
1,“We need to get Eydis outside.
0,Staying inside for this long is not healthy.” 
0,Sammy sat next to Justin across from Chloe and Miriam at a table in the commons of the student center on campus.
0,Justin’s eyebrows furrowed in frustration.
0,"“I’ve tried, but she barely even talks to me anymore.” "
0,“She won’t even talk to us at all.” 
0,"Miriam placed her hand on Chloe’s shoulder, and Chloe nodded slowly."
0,"“She probably feels bad about all the people who died, but it wasn’t her fault.”"
0,Sammy shook her head.
0,"“While that might be part of it, she was going out with us before, right?"
0,She only became a recluse after the police started pestering us constantly.
0,Maybe she doesn’t want to get us involved in her problems.”
0,"“None of this is her fault,” Justin grumbled, “but knowing her, she’s blaming herself for it anyway.” "
0,Chloe and Miriam looked crestfallen at the center of the table in unison.
0,“Then we just need to find something to get her mind off it.
0,What about another trip to the mall?
0,Or we could go out and eat at the diner?”
0,"Sammy liked Chloe’s suggestion, but Justin shot it down."
0,“I already suggested that.
0,She turned it down.
0,"She didn’t give a reason, but think about it."
0,When do we go to the diner?”
0,“For celebrations…” 
0,Chloe’s shoulders slumped after realizing what Justin was hinting.
0,"“If she feels that she is at fault for any of this, she would obviously be against treating herself.”"
0,Miriam tapped her fingers on the table pensively.
0,“Then maybe take it from another direction.
0,"We just need to get her out and active again, right?"
0,"I feel kind of bad about suggesting this, but we can rely on that guilt to have her follow through with the plan to teach us combat magic.”"
0,"“Miriam, that’s terrible…” "
0,Chloe stared at Miriam with mild disgust.
0,"“No, no, no."
0,I’m not saying guilt trip her into it.
0,That would be heartless.
0,"If we ask her to teach us now, she is bound to agree."
0,"She cares for us more than anything, right?"
0,She’s probably worrying about us and our safety now that people from her world finally arrived.
0,Sammy even said this might be because we are being pulled into her problems.
0,"She tried to get us to cut ties with her for our own safety, but we wouldn’t."
0,Now she is the one trying to stay away from us.
0,Teaching us to defend ourselves on even grounds against them might put her at ease a little.
0,It could only help.”
0,The table went silent.
0,“Let’s do it.”
0,““Justin!”” Both Sammy and Chloe complained in unison.
0,“I’ll ask her.
0,"I don’t agree with relying on her guilt or worry to force her, but I also don’t want any of you to be hurt either."
0,"I feel responsible for what has happened, and I want each of you to be able to defend yourself.”"
0,“Says the weakest one here.” Sammy nudged Justin with her shoulder.
0,“We’ll leave it to you to convince Eydis.”
1,"That evening, Eydis sat at the kitchen table eating the dinner Justin prepared while he worked on his homework beside her."
0,"He had tried to initiate a conversation, but Eydis completely ignored it and only said three words, “I am hungry”, so he made her dinner."
0,"Her lack of appetite over the past two days prompted the worried discussion at the university, so Justin was glad Eydis finally ate."
0,They sat in deafening silence listening to the scraping of Eydis’s fork on the plate and the tapping of Justin’s laptop keyboard.
0,Eydis was the first to break the silence when she stood up to place her plate and fork in the sink.
0,“Thank you.” Eydis then proceeded to walk past Justin to the hallway.
0,"“Eydis, hold on please."
0,I have something to ask you.”
0,Justin’s words stopped her mid step.
0,She looked over her shoulder almost suspicious about what Justin might say.
0,“The girls and I have been talking…”
0,"Worry replaced suspicion, and she averted her gaze."
0,Justin took a breath and beckoned Eydis to come sit back down.
0,She hesitated but complied.
0,"“Back when we all met in Dr. Shuman’s office, conversation came up about--”"
0,"Eydis stood and tried to walk away, but Justin clasped her hand gently."
0,He was sure now that she was worried about what happened and that she wanted to avoid talking about anything related to it.
0,"That day, many people died, and she firmly believed that the police confined her."
0,"“Eydis, please.”"
0,“…I will listen.” 
0,Eydis sat back in her chair and looked down at the table.
0,Justin never let go of her hand and grasped it with his other as well.
0,"“You tried to convince Miriam, Chloe, and Sammy to stop associating with you in order to protect them."
0,They are worried about you because you have refused to contact them or pick up your phone when they call.
0,You turned Sammy away when she came to visit yesterday.
0,"But, I understand why you would want to protect them.”"
0,Justin’s grip tightened ever so slightly to reassure Eydis that he was not accusing her of anything.
0,“Chloe brought up the idea of you teaching them how to fight using magic.”
0,Eydis’s hand balled into a fist in his grasp.
0,“I will not teach any of you how to fight.
0,I cannot--”
0,"“No, that’s not it,” Justin interrupted and shook his head."
0,“I am not asking this so that we can fight Jethro.
0,"To be honest, I hope we never hear about him again let alone meet one of his assassins."
0,I am asking in the off chance that one of us do happen to encounter one of the people after you.
0,"I am scared, not for myself, but for Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam."
0,I am sure you are as well.”
0,Eydis’s eyes shifted to her hand being cradled in Justin’s grasp.
0,“You want them to be safe.”
0,"“I want us all to be safe, and if teaching them how to defend against magic will help them, of course I want them to learn.” "
0,“What about you?” 
0,Justin only shook his head with a self-depreciating smirk.
0,“You know better than anyone how hopeless I am at magic.
0,I am asking for their sake.”
0,Eydis sat in silence as the minutes ticked by.
0,In the end she shook her head.
0,"“Please, Eydis.” "
0,"Justin could not let Eydis turn down his plea, for her sake just as much as for his friends."
0,"“You really do care for those girls…” Again, Eydis thought in silence."
0,“I cannot answer you now.
0,Can you give me a day to think on it?”
0,This was the best reply Justin felt he was going to get.
0,“Of course.”
1,"The next evening, Eydis avoided bringing the topic up, and when Justin bridged the topic, she diverted it immediately."
0,This continued for another couple days.
0,Justin realized that Eydis’s request for time was not to give the offer consideration but to hope that Justin would forget or drop the suggestion.
0,"If she decided not to, she could tell him, and he would accept that answer."
0,He wanted to push but felt guilty doing so.
0,"If she really did not feel like teaching them, nothing could be done."
0,“Eydis.” Justin knocked on her bedroom door.
0,"Every evening at the same approximate time, Justin brought up the suggestion again, asking if Eydis had made her decision."
0,She knew what he came to ask.
0,“You want an answer.”
0,"Eydis spoke through the closed door, so Justin opened it and found Eydis sitting on her bed, back against the wall and book in hand, one of Sean’s."
0,"In her self-imposed confinement, Sean’s books were her only source of entertainment."
0,"“If you do not want to teach them, just say so."
0,But I do think that it would be the best for all of us.
0,They know I asked you and are also waiting eagerly for your answer.
0,They want to learn.”
0,“You told them before I answered?” 
0,"Eydis set her book down in frustration, not marking her page."
0,“They were the ones who brought up the idea initially.” Justin sat on the bed beside Eydis.
0,“How about this?
0,"If you hold one lesson, I will treat you to something.”"
0,Eydis looked at Justin quizzically.
0,“A reward?”
0,“Of sorts.
0,Just a bit of an incentive.
0,"I am the one asking, so it only makes sense that I would compensate you, right?”"
0,"A faint smile grew on Eydis’s face, the first smile Justin had seen in days."
0,"“I… I will try, but I will let you decide where to hold the lessons."
0,We surely cannot do them here.”
0,“Or Miriam’s apartment.” 
0,Eydis’s eyes widened a little and she took a quick breath.
0,“Of course not at her apartment either.”
1,Was asking me to find a place to hold the lessons just another attempt to stall?
0,Justin grumbled.
0,"Having seen the photos of the devastation of the field where Eydis and Jethro’s men fought, he needed to find a place that could handle the damage that combat magic could cause."
0,But it’s not like they will be able to do that much damage from the start.
0,"His pillow grew uncomfortably warm, so Justin flipped it over and readjusted his blanket."
0,The clock on the living room wall showed half past midnight.
0,He had spent the past two days thinking about where to hold the lessons and investigating the possibilities.
0,"Calling Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam also gave no leads, but they each promised to think about it."
0,"Even if he could find a location that could handle the damage of magic amateurs, he also needed the place to be secret, or at least somewhere that those who should not know about magic would not see them or find out."
0,"An abandoned building or warehouse would be ideal, but landing on such a prime location was nothing but fiction."
0,"Even if such a place existed somewhere in the city, Justin did not know how he could locate one let alone be able to use it without the original owner of the property finding out or someone noticing something and calling the police on them while they practiced."
0,“The police.” Justin threw off the blanket and ran down the hallway to Sean’s room.
0,"“Sean, you awake?”"
0,"The door cracked open, and Sean stood at the door still dressed in jeans and a white polo shirt."
0,“You realize what time it is?”
0,“Just a quick question.
0,Do you think the police would be able to provide a location for Eydis to teach magic?”
0,“You aren’t thinking straight.
0,What reason would the police have to provide it?
0,"Beyond that, what is the police’s current opinion of Eydis?”"
0,"Sean was about to close the door, but Justin placed his hand on it."
0,“What if there was something that Eydis could offer the police that would be beneficial to them?
0,"They have never fought against magic before, so being able to witness it and learn from it would help them just as much as it would help us.”"
0,Sean’s left eyebrow twitched in annoyance.
0,"“Again, what is Eydis’s current opinion of the police?"
0,She’s not leaving the house because of the trouble they caused.
0,Do you really think she would want to help them?
0,Go to sleep.
0,Your mind will be clearer after some rest.”
0,"Justin was left staring at the closed door, and he could hear Sean return to his desk to continue typing on his computer."
0,This was still the best option.
0,"Back in the living room, Justin sat on the couch to think more on the idea."
0,The police could not turn down this proposal.
0,"They already lost multiple officers to fire magic, and all the police in the city were likely informed of the existence of magic by now."
0,"Eydis, Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam were the only ones in the city that they would be able to ask to teach them about magic."
0,Each of them also had affinities to different elements.
0,"If they could become practiced in combat magic, the police would be able to observe the offensive capabilities of each element, potentially saving the lives of the officers who might encounter Jethro’s men."
0,It was a win-win.
0,"The only obstacle then was Eydis, but Justin also felt that she would agree to it."
0,"Sure, she was avoiding the police, but Eydis had jumped at the idea of teaching people before, and she had finally agreed to teach combat magic for the sake of everyone’s safety, so Justin was confident that with the goal of saving lives in mind, she would agree to working with the police despite her aversion to them."
0,It might also improve her relationship with them and show them that she was not a threat.
0,Another win-win.
0,“I will ask her first thing in the morning.”
1,“I refuse.” Eydis’s reply was curt.
0,Justin’s hand froze while lifting a slice of French toast to his mouth.
0,"He had prepared it for breakfast, including apricot preserves, fresh mint leaves, and whipped cream, with the hope of improving Eydis’s mood."
0,"Although she seemed to enjoy it more than usual, her favorite breakfast did nothing to sway her."
0,“You won’t do it?”
0,“Those police see me as an enemy.” 
0,“This is the best way for the police to view you in a better light.
0,I’m sure they don’t consider you the same as the men who are after you.
0,They are probably just wary because magic is not supposed to exist.
0,Familiarizing them with magic will make them less cautious of you.”
0,Eydis set her fork and knife down on her cleared plate and popped a tiny mint leaf in her mouth.
0,Her cheeks flushed lightly.
0,“Or it will make them fear me more.”
0,"“Instead of fear, what if they were grateful to you?"
0,That one minum proved that Jethro’s men are not afraid to take the lives of both police and civilians.
0,The entire purpose of these lessons is to prevent more people from dying.
0,"I am worried about Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam just as much as the police are worried about the city’s safety."
0,What you teach us could save lives.”
0,Eydis froze in thought after picking up the last mint leaf from her plate.
0,"She did not appear as if she would move any time soon, so Justin cleared their plates from the table and washed them in the sink."
0,"He then returned the preserves, whipped cream, and mint sprigs to the fridge."
0,"When he sat back down, Eydis had not moved from her contemplation even a millimeter."
0,"“If anything, could you do it for me?”"
0,Eydis’s eyes closed and a faint smile grew.
0,"“A personal favor now, is it?”"
0,"Justin flashed the most endearing grin he could muster, but it only served to make Eydis chuckle."
0,She sighed.
0,“You care little for yourself and ask only for the safety of others.” 
0,"Eydis shook her head and said, “What have I gotten myself into choosing to live with such a man?” under her breath."
0,"“If you are so worried, I will work with the police, but will they agree?"
0,"You have not asked them yet, right?”"
0,“I will go to the station today and ask.
0,"If they say no, there is nothing we can do.”"
1,"* * *
Major Wickenny readily agreed to find a suitable location when Justin brought up the possibility of witnessing combat magic firsthand."
0,"The following day, Justin received the call stating that they would use an outdoor firing range in the mountains about an hour out of the city."
0,"The range had been inactive for a few years, so it was the perfect location for secrecy."
0,"Currently, the dirt road to it was closed, but the police would be able to grant access."
0,Eydis waited at the police station with uneased fingers gripping nervously at the bottom hem of her coat.
0,"Sammy, Chloe, Miriam, and Sean were also present."
0,Major Wickenny arrived and led them out back to the parking lot where they were met by two officers and Agent Botteger.
0,"With five people per truck, they drove out of the city to the mountains."
0,"Each passing mile, Eydis’s nerves only worsened."
0,“You okay?” Justin held Eydis’s hand firmly.
0,“I am fine.”
0,Eydis continued looking out the thin window of the truck’s back seat.
0,"She was trying to feign composure, but Justin knew she was troubled and that he was the cause."
0,"“Sorry for asking you to do this,” he said."
0,Eydis shook her head.
0,“You had good reason to ask.
0,I could not turn you down.
0,I trust you will make my reward worth my trouble.”
0,“You bribed her?” 
0,Sammy glared at Justin.
0,“She wouldn’t budge.
0,It was the only thing I could think of at the time.”
0,"“If this goes well, we will compensate her too,” Major Wickenny chimed in from the driver’s seat."
0,“It was not the reward.
0,"Justin was concerned for your safety, Sammy."
0,We do not know when or where more of those terrorists will appear.
0,I do not want you to come to harm either.”
0,Sammy leaned against Justin’s shoulder and reached across to grasp his and Eydis’s interlocked hands.
0,"“Thanks,” she said with a bright smile."
1,"Once off the highway, Major Wickenny followed a mountain road still lined with a foot of snow."
0,It wound through a shallow valley with deep banks on either side.
0,"The snow on the road had melted making the trip easy, but after another fifteen minutes, they pulled off onto a gravel road and immediately met a simple orange bar acting as a barrier against vehicle entry."
0,The other officer in Major Wickenny’s truck exited and unlocked the barrier to let both trucks through.
0,"Snow covered the remaining road, having been shaded from the sun by the slopes and ridges the road wove through."
0,"Justin felt that they would get stuck in the one- or two-foot drifts, but Major Wickenny skillfully maneuvered the path until they reached a large clearing that looked like the hill behind it had been carved out to make the entire range level and give a solid earth backdrop."
0,Most of the clearing had little more than a few inches of remaining snow due to being in direct sunlight but at a high enough elevation to be too cold to fully melt yet.
0,A small shack sat in the corner by the entrance.
0,Both trucks pulled in next to it and let everyone out.
0,"“It’s much cooler up here,” Miriam said while rubbing her hands."
0,Chloe hopped out of the truck and almost slipped on the snow.
0,“My shoes aren’t meant for this.”
1,Sean walked beside Major Wickenny to the shack and went inside.
0,Justin and Sammy followed.
0,"It contained two couches, a table in the center, and a large variety of targets and stands in the back."
0,Major Wickenny shuffled through some of the targets and stood up a wooden stand to show Justin.
0,“Anything here that can be of use?”
0,“Is it alright if we use them?
0,They might get destroyed.”
0,"From what Justin understood, this used to be a private business, so weren’t the targets someone’s property?"
0,Major Wickenny promptly answered Justin’s unspoken concerns.
0,“Don’t worry about that.
0,The police of Gullivan and other nearby towns were given permission to use the range as needed after it closed.
0,Everything here was supplied by the station.
0,Use it freely.”
0,“Awesome.
0,Then it just depends on what Eydis needs.”
0,Justin looked behind him.
0,Eydis had not followed.
1,He left the shack and returned to the field.
0,The two police and Agent Botteger eyed the clearing with slack-jawed faces.
0,"Much of the snow on the shack side of the clearing was gone, having been blown to the side by Eydis’s wind magic."
0,“Is this better?” Eydis asked.
0,“Thank you!” Chloe cheered.
0,Eydis noticed Chloe’s lack of proper footwear and cleared the snow from the area everyone would be practicing.
0,"“Amazing, isn’t it?” Miriam boasted in front of the officers with wide gestures full of finesse almost as if she had been the one who cleared the field, but Chloe quickly stepped in to let the officers know their reaction was normal."
0,"“This is the first time we’ve seen magic used to this extent, so it’s just as surprising for us to be honest.”"
0,Justin walked over to Eydis in the center of the cleared dirt and gravel.
0,“There are targets inside the shack.
0,You want to take a look to see what you can use?”
0,“I do not think we will be needing targets yet.
0,Maybe… Bring out one or two.”
0,"Eydis did not sound confident in her decision, almost as if she did not have a lesson plan ready."
0,Justin knew she would be fine and wished that she would have more confidence in herself.
0,This should be no different than teaching the self-defense class or her regular magic lessons.
0,Only the nature of the combat and magic changed.
0,"In any case, he knew that demonstrations were what the police were here to see, so targets would be necessary."
0,He ran back to the shack and helped Sean and Major Wickenny carry out two of the cheaper looking wooden stands and paper targets.
1,Everyone gathered adjacent to the shack on the edge of the area Eydis cleared.
0,The police stood off to the side near the trucks to observe.
0,"Justin expected Sean to join them, but he stood on the opposite side of the group of women from Justin."
0,"Sean’s reasoning was that because he lived with Eydis, the possibility of him getting involved with Jethro’s men was higher, so he wanted to stand in on the lesson to learn what he could even if he could not use magic."
0,"If anything, ven control could be practiced even without magic ability."
0,Eydis stood silent to gather her thoughts.
0,"You can do this, Justin assured her in his mind."
0,It’s no different than teaching your self-defense class.
0,"Eydis had no reason to be nervous or worried, but she also knew that the police were expecting this to be worth their time."
0,"Justin doubted that they would judge Eydis’s every action, but there was no guarantee that Eydis wouldn’t feel she was being judged by them."
0,You can do this.
0,"After a deep breath, Eydis finally spoke."
0,“Magic comes from energy inside your body called ven.
0,"Ven is present in everything from the ground under you to the sky above you, but it is found most in things with life, like you, me, and even plants and animals.”"
0,"Why is she starting from the basics, Justin thought, but then realized that neither Sean nor the police had heard any of this before."
0,The others did not seem confused by Eydis’s review.
0,Surely they realized this as well.
0,“Each person that can use magic is able to use one or more of eight different types.
0,"For example, I can use wind magic, Sammy can use water, Chloe can use fire, and Miriam can use earth.”"
0,"“What are the other four elements,” Agent Botteger asked."
0,"“Life, space, time, and gravity,” Sammy replied."
0,“So they aren’t really elements in the traditional sense.
0,"Eydis also can use life and spatial magic, and Justin has an affinity to time, but he can’t really do anything with it.”"
0,"After the interruption, Eydis fell silent."
0,"“Oh, sorry Eydis!"
0,You can continue.” 
0,"Sammy quickly apologized, and the police who asked the question followed."
0,“You are fine.
0,"If you can answer any of their questions, please do.”"
0,Eydis flashed a weary smile and fell silent again.
0,No one spoke up to ask a question or help move the lesson forward.
0,Awkward tension spread throughout the group.
0,Justin knew something was wrong.
0,He had never seen Eydis act like this.
0,This tension was felt by those most familiar with Eydis as they exchanged confused glances at each other.
0,"“You are here to learn about combat magic, so I should start there,” she finally said."
0,Everyone returned their attention.
0,“Each element is different when it comes to combat.
0,"I feel life magic might be the deadliest, but you need to touch the person to do any harm."
0,I was almost killed by life magic without even realizing it.
0,The only way to survive it is to use life magic to stop it.”
0,Justin’s heart skipped a beat.
0,When did that happen?
0,Was it before Eydis came to this world or after?
0,Was it when she was captured?
0,This was the first he had heard of it.
0,"The others were just as concerned, but for the spectators, the concern was not directed towards Eydis."
0,"“Are you saying that the only way to protect yourself from being killed by life magic is to be able to use life magic,” Agent Botteger asked."
0,Eydis nodded.
0,“You must be more skilled than your opponent or you will die.”
0,The spectators whispered among themselves.
0,This had to be the worst news for them to hear.
0,There was no way to protect against it.
0,“Life magic is rare.
0,"Do not get touched, and you will be fine."
0,"After life magic, the next deadliest might be fire magic."
0,You saw what fire could do when you let the Minum escape.
0,"Ice is also very powerful, so water magic is strong.” Eydis paused."
0,“And so is wind.
0,"In my fight against the terrorists, my wind magic made the long scar across the ground.”"
0,“So they are all strong in combat?” Sean asked.
0,"“By the skill of the user, yes.”"
0,Major Wickenny raised his hand.
0,“Could you give us a demonstration of your wind magic?
0,"Not clearing the field, but something used in combat?”"
0,Eydis nodded and turned toward the two targets on the far end of the field.
0,Justin was glad he brought them out.
0,"“Wind magic is hard to see, so I will increase its strength.”"
0,Excitement grew on the faces of everyone present.
0,"As far as Justin knew, no one here had seen combat magic."
0,He certainly had not.
0,"His heart thundered in anticipation, and he looked on at Eydis and the target over fifty yards from her."
0,Eydis extended her arm diagonally downward to her side.
0,"Her pants, coat, and hair billowed in a breeze that no one else could feel."
0,"At the palm on her hand, the air distorted and blurred."
0,The blur stretched about five feet long into what looked like a swirling rod.
0,"As it grew in intensity, Justin could feel the wind if only faintly from his position far behind her."
0,The spear disappeared from her hand with a swift forward swipe of her arm.
0,The near-transparent object flew at incredible speed and impacted the wooden target at the end of the cleared snow.
0,"It bored through, disintegrating the paper target fastened to the front, and picked up the wooden stand."
0,The stand shredded into splinters as the wind spear carried it into the ridge another fifty yards back.
0,What was left of the stand blew apart as the wind of the spear dispersed on impact.
0,"Everyone froze speechless, but to Justin’s surprise, so did Eydis."
0,She stared at the small crater in the ridge created by the spear.
0,“Eydis?”
0,Justin jogged over to Eydis and placed his hand on her arm.
0,She was breathing heavily from the wind conversion that must have been required for the spell.
0,“That was the strongest spear I have ever made.
0,I did not think that was possible.” 
0,Her voice was so quiet that Justin was the only person to hear her.
0,A small smile grew on her face.
0,“I must be getting closer.”
0,“Closer?” 
0,Eydis looked down at Justin and shook her head.
0,“It is nothing.”
0,"She turned around, and immediately Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam swarmed her."
0,“That was amazing!”
0,“I’ve never seen anything like that!” 
0,“Are we going to get that strong with enough training?” 
0,The police did not see the same excitement on their faces.
0,There was only fear.
0,Justin could tell exactly what they were thinking.
0,How could anyone defend against such an attack?
0,Any person hit with it would be killed instantly.
0,It even had the possibility of killing multiple people at once.
0,"Worst of all, no physical weapon was needed."
0,Eydis did this with her power alone.
0,Her earlier concern rang warning bells in Justin’s mind.
0,“It will make them fear me more.”
0,“Eydis!
0,Is there a way to defend against this?
0,Is there a way?”
0,Everyone looked at Justin a little bewildered by his sudden panicked question.
0,Their excitement died as they also realized what Justin was saying.
0,Sammy spoke everyone’s thoughts.
0,"“If any of us were up against that, what could we do?”"
0,Eydis placed her hands on Sammy’s shoulders and tried to reassure her with a smile.
0,"“This magic is stronger than what you can handle now, but you are still learning."
0,"Practice and get better, and something like this will be nothing to you.”"
0,"Whether this was true or not, Justin did not know, but Sammy seemed pleased with Eydis’s words of confidence."
0,“Ms. FeAmel.”
0,Major Wickenny approached the group after having discussed something with the other officers.
0,His expression was stern and still carried in it the lingering fear of what he had witnessed.
0,Justin stepped back to make room.
0,“You just said that Ms. Thompson would be able to do what you did or equivalent with enough practice.
0,Is that correct?”
0,Eydis looked at Sammy with concern and then back at Major Wickenny.
0,“You are worried that Sammy will become dangerous?
0,Are these lessons not so they can defend against the terrorists as equals?”
0,“You seem to be mistaking our purpose here.
0,"We want to know how to protect people from them, not create more people with the same destructive power.”"
0,“Is that not the same?
0,You were too weak to stop only one of them with your weapons.
0,"If Sammy can do better than all the police you lost, should she not learn?"
0,I fail to understand--”
0,"One of the police that had ridden in the other truck, Officer Beynard, brushed Justin aside and glared at Eydis."
0,“My brother lost his life fighting that terrorist even you could not kill.
0,I will not let you insult him.”
0,"“Larry, that’s enough.” "
0,Major Wickenny placed his hand on Officer Beynard’s shoulder to turn him away.
0,"“Yes, in a many against one battle, I did not have the luxury to make certain all were dead, but your people not only helped him, your brother could not even defeat an injured enemy.”"
0,“Eydis!” Sammy moved in front of Eydis and pleaded with her eyes for Eydis to stop.
0,"Officer Beynard turned around to confront Eydis again, but Justin blocked him."
0,Something was wrong with Eydis.
0,"Justin had never seen her act like this, but he also did not want the officer to do anything to her."
0,Major Wickenny pushed Officer Beynard back to the trucks.
0,Sammy clung to the sleeves of Eydis’s coat.
0,“What’s the matter with you?” 
0,Eydis’s gaze fell away dejectedly.
0,“I only wanted them to realize what they were up against.
0,Everything I said was true.
0,"If your city police cannot fight Jethro’s men, teaching you how to fight them is the only way I can keep you safe.”"
0,“That doesn’t mean you can insult someone’s dead brother.” 
0,"Eydis’s shoulders slumped, and she struggled to speak her next words."
0,“I… I have no desire to be kind to them.
0,"I may have brought a war to this city, and the sooner they realize this, the better… "
0,"If they do not understand their own weakness, they will not become stronger.” "
0,Major Wickenny returned alone.
0,“And that is precisely why we made arrangements to take you out of the city where you could be better protected.”
0,“And I already told you that removing me will not help you.
0,"My goal is to make sure Sammy and the others are safe, and I will teach them if it will help."
0,The best you can do is watch and hope you learn a way to fight it.”
0,"“I’m sorry, but we have already decided that no more combat lessons will be held after today."
0,"None of your friends here have had proper combat training, so I cannot permit teaching them something that is as dangerous as what you have shown us."
0,"I have a few more requests for you today, but after that, we will be finished here.”"
0,"“If you will not let me help my friends, then I have nothing more to show you."
0,"I now know of this location, so we can come here whenever we want with my teleportation."
0,We no longer have need of you.”
0,Sammy cut in.
0,"“Eydis, it’s fine."
0,They are only trying to protect the people who live in Gullivan.
0,"You said it yourself, right?"
0,They need to know what they are up against.”
0,"Eydis looked long at Sammy’s pleading eyes, and slowly the tension in Eydis’s melted away."
0,"Justin felt that if Sammy had been the one to personally request combat magic lessons, Eydis would have complied immediately."
0,"A mild feeling of inferiority rose within him, but it was overshadowed by the joy that Eydis had such a dear friend."
0,“What requests do you have of me?
0,"Let us finish with them and be done,” Eydis ordered."
0,Major Wickenny nodded and then took out a small notepad from his coat pocket.
0,“First is to know what weapons or firearms would be useful against your magic.”
0,“I know nothing of your weapons.
0,Did you bring any with you?”
0,“Only a handgun.” 
0,Major Wickenny flashed the firearm at his waist.
0,"“Seeing only one weapon, I cannot answer your question, but I doubt something that small would have any effect.”"
0,“That is fine.
0,"Next was for you to show us how to defend against the fire magic that killed so many people, but you are not able to use fire magic, so this request might not be possible, but… I will change the question."
0,You used a projectile style magic earlier.
0,The man who killed so many people used a different type of magic.
0,"From the camera footage, fire shot up from below their feet."
0,"To me, it looks like there is no way to defend against this."
0,Do you know a way?
0,"He is still out there, so this is very important.”"
0,Eydis did not answer.
0,She looked at her hand while deep in thought.
0,Her fingers moved as if trying to feel the shape of an invisible object.
0,"“Everyone, stand back,” she ordered."
1,"Major Wickenny moved back to his fellow police by the trucks, and Justin followed Sammy and everyone else back to where they had been standing at the beginning of the lesson."
0,"Eydis motioned with her arm, hand, and fingers as if trying to use magic, but nothing happened."
0,"The longer this continued, minute signs of frustration began to appear in Eydis’s movements."
0,"Justin noticed that in random places in the clearing, dirt or snow shifted around."
0,"His eyes followed them, and the more it happened, the more worried he became."
0,"He looked over at the others, and no one else seemed to have noticed, or they had noticed but thought nothing of it."
0,"When a large amount of dirt kicked up between Eydis and the group, Justin knew something was wrong."
0,"“Eydis, stop!” The warning came from Miriam."
0,Eydis turned around.
0,"At the same time spiraling wind erupted from a location in the center between where Eydis, the police, Justin, and the others were standing."
0,Near-invisible crescent arcs of wind flew out in all directions from the whirlwind.
0,One arc approached Justin at incredible speed but slowed down to a crawl when it neared.
0,Justin flung himself backward to avoid it but did not notice the smaller arc just behind it that was now heading for his left arm.
0,He moved his arm upwards as the slow arc passed and nearly avoided it by a few inches.
0,"When he landed on his back, the world returned to its normal speed."
0,He gasped for breath from the impact on his back.
0,"His arm stung terribly from where the smaller arc passed, but when he looked at the tear in his sleeve, the injury appeared no worse than having something thin whipped across it--a pink line with only the top layer of skin torn."
0,No doubt a terrible bruise would form later.
0,This was the damage caused by avoiding the arc by inches.
0,"If it had hit, he knew the damage would have been far worse."
0,Fear struck like lightning.
0,He jumped up and looked at Eydis.
0,Her arm was extended towards Sammy who was unharmed.
0,Chloe next to Sammy was on her back bleeding from cuts on her left leg and arm.
0,Sean was on his back with Miriam on top of him.
0,Her back had a long slash across it that cut clean through her coat and shirt and exposed her lower back.
0,"A thick pink welt line spread completely across her back, but she was otherwise unharmed."
0,Eydis ran over in a panic.
0,“No!
0,I am so sorry!
0,That was not supposed to happen!
0,I… Chloe!” 
0,Eydis ran to Chloe and quickly slid her hands over the lacerations.
0,“I’m okay.
0,I’m okay.” 
0,Chloe forced a pained smile.
0,Blood soaked her pant leg and sleeve.
0,The cuts could not have been light.
0,Justin scanned everyone and was relieved that no one else was badly injured.
0,He then looked over at the police.
0,“E-Eydis!
0,The police!”
1,Justin grabbed Eydis’s hand and ran to the trucks.
0,Major Wickenny was bleeding from his left shoulder.
0,"Agent Botteger and one of the other officers were unharmed, but Officer Beynard lay on the ground bleeding profusely from his side."
0,The uninjured officer drew his gun and aimed it at Eydis.
0,“Don’t move!”
0,Major Wickenny ignored his injury and rushed to the side of Officer Beynard.
0,"Meanwhile, Agent Botteger pulled out his phone."
0,“Put your gun down!
0,Eydis can help him!” 
0,"Justin pleaded with the officer, but the gun remained raised."
0,“He cannot hurt us.” 
0,Eydis ignored the weapon aimed at her and ran with Justin to Major Wickenny.
0,The officer hesitated but lowered his firearm.
0,"“Major Wickenny, let Eydis help."
0,She can heal--” Justin’s words caught in his throat.
0,"His head grew light, and his vision wavered like agitated water."
0,The damage done to the downed officer was far worse than what he had seen from a distance.
0,The cut had severed clean through Officer Beynard’s side about four inches deep or more.
0,"If not treated fast, it would be fatal."
0,“Move aside!” 
0,Eydis immediately ran her hand through the cut.
0,"Major Wickenny was about to pull her away, but the flow of blood from the wound stemmed."
0,"She slid her hand in the deep wound and worked to repair the damaged tissue, but her face quickly grew strained."
0,"“Justin, hold my hand.”"
0,"Justin held Eydis’s outstretched, bloody hand while she worked."
0,“Roll up my sleeve and yours.
0,Wrap your arms around mine.
0,"The more skin contact, the better.”"
0,Justin obeyed the odd request without question and clasped Eydis’s forearm between both of his.
0,“It is not enough.
0,I am almost out of ven.
0,He is stable for now.
0,I will return quickly.”
0,Eydis let go of Justin and ran a few yards away.
0,She vanished with the sound of a loud snap using a form of teleportation that Justin had never seen.
0,"Sammy, Chloe, Miriam, and Sean arrived and were shocked at the severity of Officer Beynard’s wounds."
0,Major Wickenny kept pressure on the wound to keep it closed to prevent further bleeding even though the bleeding had completely stopped.
0,At least Officer Beynard was still breathing.
0,"“A life flight helicopter is on its way,” Agent Botteger announced."
0,“I can’t believe that witch attacked us!
0,We should have locked her up when we had the chance.” 
0,The officer who drew his gun on Eydis was fuming.
0,"Justin understood why he was angry, but he could not ignore any insult to Eydis."
0,“Anyone could see that was an accident!”
0,“Accident?
0,"You all are unharmed, but the one of us who confronted her ends up nearly killed?"
0,I find that hard to believe.”
0,"Justin wanted to say Chloe was injured--she was in the back of the group, so her injuries were not visible to the officer--but Miriam cut in before Justin could."
0,“It was an accident.
0,Don’t let your fear make you stupid.
0,Eydis would never attack you.
0,She’s just been off since she was captured.
0,I’m positive she never meant any harm.
0,"If she did, she wouldn’t be trying so hard to save him.”"
0,"“But still, this is unlike Eydis…” "
0,"Once Chloe voiced her worry, Sammy could not deny it either."
0,“Yah.
0,I haven’t seen her this distressed since Justin tried to kick her out of his apartment.”
0,"Justin wanted to retort, but he knew that Sammy was right."
0,Eydis was not in her right mind.
0,"“It’s almost like she is a different person,” Miriam sighed."
0,"“Miriam, would you be the same?"
0,She fought for her life and then was imprisoned for a week waiting to be taken somewhere where she would probably be executed or worse.
0,She…” Justin’s own words sank in his chest.
0,Painful anxiety grew.
0,Executed or worse…
0,"Eydis’s startling warning to Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam about what could happen to them if they were captured by Jethro’s men brought a painful understanding of what might have happened during the week she was captured."
0,Her sudden shout was unlike her usual outbursts caused by misunderstanding or wrongful accusation.
0,There was a real terror and pain that seeped out through her cry.
0,Justin could not imagine that such a painful cry could come without having experienced the same pain she was warning the girls against.
0,"“But it’s true, isn’t it?"
0,"We all realize it,” Miriam said."
0,"“You can’t deny it either, right?”"
0,Justin staggered back as the ignorant conversation continued around him.
0,"If Eydis was assaulted in captivity, of course her emotional state would weaken or change."
0,Of course she would be distressed and afraid.
0,Of course she would not want to be taken away by soldiers somewhere far from her friends.
0,"Those were human soldiers, the same as those who attacked her."
0,“Could you all stop already?!” 
0,Justin shouted.
0,“You have no idea what kind of--”
0,“Move out of the way.” 
0,Eydis nudged Justin aside.
0,"At some point in the conversation, she had returned."
0,Miriam clamped shut and stepped back with a guilty countenance.
0,Eydis knelt at the side of Officer Beynard.
0,"The wound healed quickly, and in a few minutes’ time, she was sealing the skin back together."
0,The fresh pink skin showed little sign that the injury had ever existed.
0,"When finished, Eydis placed her hand on Officer Beynard’s forehead, and his eyes shot open."
0,"Dread grew on his face from the visage of the one looking down on him, and before anyone could stop him, he drew his handgun and fired."
0,"The bullet embedded itself in the dirt next to Officer Beynard’s head, having been deflected by Eydis’s barrier."
0,"Major Wickenny rushed to subdue and disarm his fellow officer, which was easy after how much blood Officer Beynard lost."
0,“I told you it would have no effect.” 
0,Eydis turned away from the man she saved.
0,Anger welled up inside Justin.
0,"Ignoring that the officer had been lethally injured just moments before, he raised his foot but was quickly pulled back by Sean before he could stomp the downed officer."
0,"Justin pushed Sean away and hurried to Eydis where Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam surrounded her in collective panic."
0,Eydis brushed everyone away and approached Major Wickenny while he was holding down Officer Beynard.
0,She placed her hand on his shoulder and immediately healed his shallow cut.
0,She then walked away from the group.
0,"Sammy tried to follow, but Eydis stopped her."
0,“I want to be alone.”
0,"Ignoring Eydis’s plea for solitude, Justin hurried to her side."
0,"She did not reject his company, for which he was grateful."
1,"Once separated from the group, Justin worked up the courage to speak."
0,He did not know what to say and struggled in his heart to think of how to comfort the dejected and defeated woman beside him.
0,"What words could he say that could ease her troubled heart, especially after what very well could have happened to her?"
0,"Coming up empty but then realizing no one had expressed their gratitude, he had something to say."
0,“Thank you for saving him.”
0,Eydis stopped walking and peered down at the frosted dirt and gravel a short distance in front of her.
0,“It was my fault that he was injured… And thank you for defending me.
0,"You were the one I was most worried about, but you are the one who has trusted me the most…”"
0,Worried about me?
0,Was she scared that I would shun her if I knew what happened to her?
0,"Despite his internal anguish, Justin could not find the courage to bring up the topic to Eydis."
0,"However, he could offer his support should she ever decide to talk about it."
0,"“Whatever is going on, you can talk with me."
0,I am here for you.”
0,“I just need some time alone.
0,Tell Major Wickenny that he need not compensate me.
0,You also have no need to reward me.”
0,Eydis opened a portal to her room and gently pushed Justin away before backing in and closing it behind her.
0,Justin was left with an empty feeling in his heart.
0,"He urged her to hold this training session, and everything went horrifically wrong."
0,"He knew Eydis was not well, and yet he still coerced her into it completely ignorant of the signs that she was hurting inside."
0,People were injured.
0,Her relationship with the police worsened.
0,She overheard her own friends talking about her behind her back at her most vulnerable moment.
0,All this was his fault.
1,He walked back to the group with an unbearable weight of guilt born over his shoulders that he struggled to keep from crushing him.
0,All he could do now was apologize to those still present.
0,“I’m sorry for all of this.
0,I’m the one who pushed her into it despite knowing that she was under a lot of stress.
0,"Please don’t blame her,” Justin said."
0,"“It would have been best if you took that into consideration beforehand, but what has happened has happened.,” Major Wickenny replied."
0,"“Thanks to her magic, we are all fine.”"
0,"Officer Beynard had calmed down, so Major Wickenny was free to talk with everyone about what just occurred."
0,"Now that the group spread out in a circle, everyone’s individual injuries or lack thereof was visible."
0,Chloe’s in particular caught Major Wickenny’s attention.
0,"Blood soaked the sleeve of her jacket from her first cut, and blood had run down her thigh soaking her pant leg from her second."
0,She was proof that this had just been a terrible accident.
0,Justin felt that he understood why the magic went awry and that it was his duty to give an explanation now that Eydis left.
0,“I have seen Eydis cast magic many times before.
0,"When you asked her how to defend against magic that shot up from the ground, I don’t think she knew how to do it."
0,She was trying to figure it out.”
0,“She should have said so.
0,I would have accepted that.
0,"We would be no worse off without knowing,” Major Wickenny said."
0,"“True, but Eydis is someone who always wants to help when she can."
0,We can’t fault her for that.”
0,"Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam nodded in agreement."
0,Major Wickenny glanced over at everyone’s injuries and stopped at Miriam.
0,“What I do not understand is how you all avoided injury in that blast.
0,Jason and Murphy only avoided it because they were standing behind Larry and me.
0,Those blades even cut into the siding of the truck.”
0,Justin looked to Miriam and Sammy.
0,"Chloe was the only one of their group unable to avoid injury, but she was the first to reply."
0,“I’d probably be dead if not for my magic.”
0,Everyone turned to Chloe with varying expressions of surprise and disbelief.
0,"No one had seen Chloe use any magic, and fire magic was not easy to hide."
0,"Noticing everyone’s confusion, she hurried to explain."
0,"“A large wind blade, or whatever you could call it, headed straight for me."
0,I panicked and tried to block it with my hands.
0,I channeled a lot of fire ven into my hands and heated the air in front of me the hottest I could.
0,"I don’t understand the physics behind it, but the blade dispersed and only cut me a little.”"
0,"Your injuries were more than just a little, Justin thought, but he remained silent."
0,Her cuts could be seen as small given the alternative and what had happened to Officer Beynard.
0,Miriam followed next and removed a pocketknife from her jeans pocket.
0,She held out her hand and ran the knife edge forcefully across the palm of her hand.
0,Major Wickenny blinked twice as if he did not believe the information his eyes transferred to his brain.
0,There was no cut.
0,“Earth magic can be used to protect from cuts.
0,I coated my body with it to protect myself and shield the closest person to me.” 
0,She glanced at Sean who smiled and nodded his head lightly in an expression of gratitude.
0,Sammy explained next.
0,“Eydis saved me with a barrier.
0,She probably realized that I couldn’t have protected myself even if I wanted to.
0,I don’t know any way to stop that with water magic.
0,"Ice might have done something, but I’ve tried making ice and can’t.”"
0,"The only explanation remaining was Justin’s, but he did not feel his was anything special."
0,“All I did was dodge them.”
0,Sammy walked up to him with a stern expression.
0,“Don’t lie.
0,We all know your special power.” 
0,Sammy swung her arm to the side and patted Justin’s chest forcefully.
0,"“Justin here can slow time, so dodging things is really easy for him, but that’s about all he can do.”"
0,The few remaining threads of reason that held Major Wickenny’s sanity finally snapped.
0,“What kind of fantasy have I found myself in?” 
0,He wiped his face and began pacing in a circle but stopped abruptly.
0,"He looked over at Justin, Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam."
0,“You are all amateurs.
0,You cannot do anything close to what Ms. FeAmel can.”
0,Sammy shook her head.
0,“Nowhere close.”
0,“We were absolutely powerless to protect ourselves.
0,Ms. FeAmel even deflected a bullet.
0,That air explosion she did looked far more powerful than the projectile she threw before and yet you were able to protect yourselves.”
0,Everyone looked around at each other.
0,No one knew what Major Wickenny meant.
0,“You can tell Ms. FeAmel that this has been rather informative.
0,"We wanted to know how to protect ourselves from magic, and now we know that we can’t, at least as we are now."
0,It is very clear that only magic can defend properly against magic.”
0,"“She was right,” Agent Botteger said, joining the circle after finishing another phone call."
0,“Teaching you all is the only way to keep you safe against it.
0,"Justin, please tell Ms. FeAmel that we can continue the lessons, but the Department of Defense will be supervising it in place of the Gullivan Police Department, and we have a huge request if Ms. FeAmel is willing.”"
1,"* * *
Justin returned with Sean from the combat magic lesson."
0,He requested Sean to make a quick stop before they arrived home and now carried a small white cardboard box in his left hand.
0,"It contained two slices of German chocolate cake from Eydis’s favorite diner, a dessert Eydis had not tried."
0,"While Sean sat on the couch and immediately picked up the book he had been reading before they departed for the magic lesson, turning to the exact page he had left off on without having marked it, Justin grabbed two forks from the kitchen."
0,He walked down the hall in slow nervous steps to Eydis’s room.
0,His heart was laced with worry.
0,Worry about how much anguish Eydis was in.
0,Worry about what he was going to say to her.
0,Worry about how he was going to apologize.
0,"With his trembling hand raised to the door, he even hesitated to knock."
0,"“If you are going to come in, come in.” "
0,Eydis’s sullen voice was muffled by more than just the door between them.
0,Justin opened the door to find her sitting on the floor in the corner by the desk with the down feather comforter he gave her for Christmas wrapped around her.
0,Her face was buried in the soft fabric with some of her hair messily bunched up into loops as she pulled the comforter tight against the back of her head.
0,"All that was visible was her hair on the top of her head, her fingers gripping the fabric, and her toes poking out from beneath with a tiny bit of her light green fleece sweatpants showing on top of them."
0,She had changed into the most comfortable clothing she owned and bundled herself up in her most comfortable blanket.
0,"Justin could not see or hear her crying, but from how she continually readjusted her trembling fingers to re-grip the fabric, he knew she was, even if only on the inside."
0,"Staring down at her did nothing to help, so Justin slowly sat cross-legged beside her close enough to brush against the comforter and placed the small white box and utensils beside him."
0,"Not knowing what to say, he gently leaned over until his shoulder rested against hers to at least let her know he was there for her."
0,There they sat in silence as the minutes passed on.
0,“I am trying…” 
0,Eydis’s trembling voice broke the silence.
0,"When she did not continue, Justin felt that she was waiting for him to reply."
0,He leaned ever so lightly further into her shoulder.
0,“You can’t blame yourself for what happened today.
0,It was an accident.”
0,“I never wanted to do that lesson!” 
0,"Eydis pulled her knees in closer to her chest and the comforter tighter around her, causing it to slip up over her head dragging a bunch of hair with it."
0,"Somehow, her tone sounded more self-depreciating than accusatory against Justin."
0,"He knew this was his fault, and after all that had happened, he felt worse that Eydis was far too kind to blame him for any of it."
0,"She probably felt that she should have been able to teach that lesson as she had countless times in the past, and she was smart enough to realize that she wasn’t up for the task after what had happened to her, but her kindness made her hold the lesson anyway for the sake of those she cared about most."
0,“I did it because it is what everyone expects of me.
0,"I thought if I did something that was normal for… for me to do, then things would return to how they were before."
0,I hate it.
0,I hate it!
0,I do not want to be trapped inside this apartment.
0,I feel like a prisoner again…”
0,“You are the only one forcing yourself to stay in here.” 
0,“Do you think I do not know that?!”
0,"Eydis’s face shot up from the comforter at Justin, but she promptly buried it again."
0,Justin thought he saw that her eyes were turning more of a burnt orange than their usual scattering of green and blue.
0,"“Do you think I do not know that,” Eydis repeated again, but with a strain that sounded as if she would break into sobbing at the slightest provocation."
0,“I was foolish to think that I could come here and live my life like nothing would be different.
0,Nobody trusts me.
0,Even Sammy doubts me…” 
0,Eydis pulled the comforter tighter so that it covered her entire head aside from a few loops of hair sticking out.
0,“I want to give up.
0,I want to end it all.”
0,“Eydis!” Justin slid in front of her with his hand gripped tightly on her shoulder.
0,“Stop that line of thinking right now.”
0,"“But, I cannot continue like this."
0,Would you not…” Eydis’s voice trailed off.
0,She shivered like the abandoned puppy he had always envisioned her as in the past only now caught alone in the frigid rain.
0,Her next words were so quiet that Justin could barely hear them.
0,“Would you not be happier if… if the old me was here instead?”
0,Something terrible had happened to her.
0,Eydis’s words confirmed it without a doubt in Justin’s mind.
0,He knew something was different about her.
0,Her emotions were more pronounced and unstable.
0,She was actively suppressing her excitement as if she felt that she no longer deserved to be happy.
0,The way she interacted with others was submissive and repressed as if she feared what everyone would say to her or what they would think about her.
0,"Even now, she was choosing her words carefully to hide what happened to her."
0,Jethro and his men did something terrible to Eydis that could not be undone.
0,If only I knew about this sooner.
0,“Part of the problem is that you have been keeping all these pent-up feelings to yourself.
0,"The more you hold them in, the more they will hurt you."
0,"If you talk to me more, talk to your friends more, we will better understand you and be able to help you."
0,We will support you and help you through it.”
0,“You would never understand.
0,You could never understand.
0,"If I told you, you would hate me, and my life here would be over!” "
0,"Eydis’s head sank deeper between her legs, showing surprising flexibility."
0,"“No, you don’t understand."
0,We have all been worried sick over you.
0,"Ever since you came back to us, we have watched you spiral into depression and shut yourself off from those who love you."
0,We do not know what happened to you when you were captured.
0,What you heard from Sammy and Chloe and Miriam at the range was just them voicing their worries.
0,"They don’t doubt you, and they have not lost their trust in you."
0,You should talk with them.”
0,"Eydis’s head rose slightly, but only enough that her forehead could rest on her knees."
0,"“But, there is too much that… I am afraid that…”"
0,"“You are talking to me, aren’t you?"
0,How is that any different?”
0,“But you are my man… 
0,"If I cannot talk with you, who can I talk to?” "
0,Justin retracted his hand in shock.
0,"His thoughts drowned in the blood that rushed to his face, unable to make sense of the words that had entered his ears."
0,Eydis’s head rose slowly like a child peeking out from under the covers after hiding from thunder in the dark.
0,Her terror was realized when she saw the shocked face of the one to whom she had spilled the troubled contents of her heart.
0,"That fear seeped into her expression, and she slid back into the wall behind her as if to distance herself from it."
0,“No… I was wrong?
0,Are you… are we not…?
0,All this time I thought… I have made a terrible mistake.
0,I… I can no longer stay here.
0,No… I…”
0,"Eydis’s words became incoherent Elven rambling, and in her dismay, she sprung to her feet to either run out of the room or create distance so she could safely teleport away."
0,"When her leg brushed Justin’s arm, his senses returned, and he clasped Eydis’s fleeing hand."
0,“Wait!”
0,Justin pulled her light frame down to her side and caught her in an embrace.
0,"The side of her face pressed against his chest, crinkling the soft cartilage of her ear."
0,He rested his cheek against the top of her head.
0,"“No, you weren’t wrong."
0,I love you.
0,I always have.
0,"So please, don’t go.”"
0,"When Justin spoke those words, Eydis shuddered."
0,He felt light moisture through his shirt where her face rested.
0,She gripped his shirt and slowly lifted herself off him.
0,He saw pain in her tear-filled eyes.
0,“Why?
0,"The first man to show me such kindness, and it hurts."
0,The first man to say he loves me and it… it is a lie.”
0,A lie?
0,Eydis’s pained eyes cut his heart like poisoned daggers spreading doubt through his veins.
0,"He loved her, or at least he thought he did."
0,He had become utterly distressed and inconsolable when she disappeared.
0,"When he realized what might have happened to her when she was captured, his heart ached deeply for her."
0,But what if he was misinterpreting his feelings of sympathy as love?
0,What if Eydis had some way to tell if he was not sincere in his declaration?
0,"The longer Justin looked at the tears building in Eydis’s eyes, the stronger he wanted to hold her, the more he longed for the return of her radiant smile like the sun after a light summer shower, reflecting its light off all it touched."
0,That smile had been tarnished by sorrow and regret.
0,"He hated Jethro for hurting Eydis, for making her like this."
0,He wanted her to smile again.
0,He wanted all that tormented her to be swept away in a flood of laughter.
0,"All these feelings he had, all these desires for the happiness of the crying woman in his arms, if that was not love, what was it?"
0,“I am not lying.
0,I will say it as many times as I need to.
0,I love you.”
0,The building tears fell from Eydis’s eyes.
0,"The grip of her hands on his shirt tightened, and she buried her face in his chest."
0,“No… No… No… No… No…”
0,The words Justin spoke to quell her worries only caused greater pain.
0,"He froze, not knowing what to do."
0,Should he hold her?
0,Should he say something else?
0,"He looked around for something, anything, when his eyes fell upon the small bump beneath the discarded comforter."
0,He lifted the still sobbing girl off his chest and looked into her bloodshot and tear-soaked eyes.
0,“Want some cake?”
0,Eydis looked up at Justin with her mouth slightly ajar and her eyebrows raised lightly in confusion above her pained eyes.
0,"After wiping a tear from her eye with his thumb, he stood and gathered the comforter, wrapping it gently around Eydis’s bare shoulders."
0,He then retrieved the white box and forks.
0,He leaned against the wall and extended his hand towards Eydis.
0,"She was another two feet away, so he let her decide whether to take it."
0,"She hesitated, but her outstretched hand clasped his."
0,"He pulled her in, leaning her against him between his legs so that her head rested just beside his and readjusted the comforter so that it wrapped snuggly around her but kept one arm free."
0,Justin opened the white box in her lap to reveal two slices of moist dark chocolate cake with coconut frosting.
0,Justin grabbed a fork and broke off a piece with both the frosting and the chocolate and coconut buttercream separating the two layers of cake.
0,The fork hovered near Eydis’s mouth until she succumbed to the sweet aroma and took a bite.
0,“How is it?”
0,Eydis grabbed the hand Justin had wrapped around her waist and tapped her feet in delight.
0,Fresh tears fell from her eyes.
0,She fought to hold back the faint coughing chuckles that escaped her mouth.
0,“Want another?”
0,"Eydis wiped her tears and nodded, so Justin cut another piece and brought it to Eydis’s mouth."
0,Once again she smiled and tapped her feet.
0,"“Eat as much as you like,” Justin said, handing the fork to Eydis."
0,"“You said you did not need a reward, but that is exactly what this is."
0,It’s a reward for coming back to us.
0,Thank you for coming back.
0,Thank you for surviving.
0,I’ll give you this and more.
0,"After all, I love you more than anything.”"
0,Eydis set the fork Justin handed her back into the box.
0,"Eydis’s head hung low, but after a few light nods, she set the box beside them and knelt forward facing Justin in the gap between his legs."
0,Eydis looked down at him with a soft smile on her tear-stained face.
0,She leaned into him and placed her forehead against his.
0,“I will stay.” 
0,He could feel the warmth radiating from her face and the faint breath of her words tickling his lips.
0,His heart raced faster for every second she held him close.
0,"She brought her face to his, and after a moment’s hesitation, her soft and smooth lips pressed against the corner of his mouth."
0,"The touch was brief, but it left Justin breathless."
0,"After pressing her forehead against his once more, Eydis stood up and placed the comforter on the bed."
0,“Thank you for caring for me so.
0,"I need a moment to myself, so I will take a bath.”"
0,"Eydis exited the room, and Justin was left alone staring at the door in panic and amazement."
0,"He promised himself after his year with Sammy that he would never enter another relationship, but if the choice was between keeping that promise to himself and losing Eydis, it was not a choice at all."
0,He loved Eydis; that much was certain.
0,"His heart continued to race from the lingering touch of Eydis’s lips, and his romance-starved mind kept worming its way into thoughts about sex, but he had to remind himself that sex was not an option."
0,It could never be an option.
0,He loved her far too much to hurt her.
0,"After a breath of relief to calm the carnal man inside, his mind cleared enough for the anxiety pricking his heart to surface, anxiety caused by something he had noticed recently but was now far more profound during the kiss."
0,Eydis’s breath smelled of blood.
0,"Chapter 9
“Confused Feelings”
Eydis"
1,Eydis closed the door to the bathroom and opened the tub faucet.
0,"Without stopping the drain, she stared at the water as it pooled and spiraled down."
0,She ran her cupped hand under the water and brought it to her mouth to wash it clean from the kiss she had given Justin.
0,Was returning his feelings the correct choice?
0,Did she have a choice after claiming he was her man?
0,What would have happened if she rejected him then?
0,What would the princess have done?
0,"With both hands cupped under the faucet, she splashed her tearstained face and stared once more at the water that spiraled down the drain."
0,“What am I doing?” she moaned in a tired whisper.
0,"In a moment of weakness caused by the days of fear and anxiety from trying to avoid all risks of her identity as an imposter being revealed, she had spilled her heart to the princess’s man."
0,"Even after stating every trouble that plagued her, he did not shy away."
0,He did not doubt her.
0,He never questioned that she was not his princess.
0,How blind is he?
0,Does he love her so much that there is no room for doubt?
0,Eydis’s hands gripped the edge of the tub hard enough for the strange material to creak.
0,She only let go for fear of it breaking.
0,Eydis pulled the tab on the faucet to let the water rain from the showerhead and opened a portal to the cellar of Rynn’s house.
1,"The cellar was dark, lit only by the faint orange glow of the furnace that Rynn kept stoked."
0,The body on the floor across from her lay motionless.
0,"Despite the warm but faint glow of the furnace, the princess’s skin appeared ghostly pale."
0,"In Eydis’s rush to save the police officer’s life in a desperate attempt to salvage what little relationship she had with the city’s guards and the princess’s friends, she fed for a second time that day."
0,"Ignoring the princess’s miserable and deathly pallor, Eydis eyed her with loathing."
0,“Why…” Eydis took one step closer to the body.
0,“Why?
0,Why?
0,Why?!
0,Why?!
0,WHY?!”
0,"Her foot swung into the princess’s stomach, and the body flew back."
0,The chains binding it caught on the stake in the ground and stopped her before she collided with the shelves against the wall.
0,“Why did you have everything?!” 
0,"Eydis fell to her knees and hunched over, cradling her arms under her."
0,“Why was your life so much better than mine?
0,Are we not the same?”
0,"Tears fell from Eydis’s eyes, but she did not try to stop them."
0,She only stared at the small wet marks they made in the cement floor.
0,"Every drop she saw, her rage grew stronger."
0,It bubbled up until it erupted through her wailing screams.
0,“You are the crowned princess!
0,A genius who is the pride of the entire empire!
0,You wanted for nothing.
0,You had family and friends.
0,You had loyal retainers.
0,You had a mother who loved you.
0,You were destined to rule the empire and bask in the praise and support of your subjects.
0,"Even when your family was assassinated, you miraculously survived!"
0,You came to a new world with new friends like Sammy and even found a man who loves you so unconditionally that he is blind!
0,And you never accepted that love?
0,Was it not good enough for you?
0,Were you too perfect for him having lived such a perfect life?”
0,"The tears became an unbroken stream down her cheeks, dripping off her chin."
0,“I was never shown love even once my entire life… I was created only to be used.
0,I am not a person.
0,I never was.
0,I was a tool for you to sacrifice.
0,I was a tool for Jethro to find you.
0,"The only people to ever show me any kindness are your humans, and only because they think I am you."
0,"The only man to ever say he loves me is Justin, and only because he thinks I am you…”"
0,Eydis grabbed one of the chains and pulled the princess closer.
0,She held the princess’s head in her hands and caressed the princess’s slightly sunken cheek.
0,“I look like you.
0,I sound like you.
0,"But, now more than ever I know… I am not you!”"
0,Eydis threw the princess away.
0,The princess’s head made an audible crack when it hit the hard floor.
0,“I cannot be you!
0,I can look more like you.
0,I can sound more like you.
0,I can use magic more like you.
0,But I am not you… 
0,Why cannot someone love me for being me?”
0,"Eydis sat up and tried to wipe her tears, but they kept flowing."
0,She forced herself to smile and chuckled.
0,"“That is not possible, is it… After all, we are not truly the same."
0,"I am a Lurr, a monster, right?"
0,You said it yourself.
0,And nobody can love a monster.”
0,As small figure stepped into the corner of Eydis’s vision.
0,Rynn stood at the bottom of the stairway.
0,"Tears fell from her cheeks onto her yellow, flower print dress."
0,She ran to Eydis and wrapped her arms around her neck.
0,She pressed her cheek as hard as she could into Eydis’s.
0,That is right… Rynn knows me as I am.
0,"But, would she be as attached if she had never been through what was done to her, if I never had to save her?"
0,Would she treat me as a monster or just think of me as the princess’s tool?
0,“Would you still love a monster like me if we met under better conditions?”
0,Rynn hugged Eydis even tighter.
0,“You are not a monster.” 
0,Rynn shifted to kneel in front of Eydis and placed her forehead against Eydis’s.
0,She wiped away Eydis’s tears and rested her hand on Eydis’s cheek.
0,“I am the second daughter of the royal Master Chef.
0,"Princess Eydis was my future empress, nothing more."
0,You saved me when I was dead.
0,You gave me life again.
0,You are not Princess Eydis.
0,You are something more.
0,You are my world.
0,Stop trying to be less than what you are.”
0,Rynn had never been so vocal.
0,"Her words sounded like a lie in Eydis’s ears, but she knew Rynn had not lied."
0,Her acute senses heard nothing but loving care.
0,"Fresh tears flowed down Eydis’s cheeks, and she sobbed."
0,"Rynn pulled Eydis down into her chest and cradled her head, brushing her hair with her fingers as Eydis had always done to her."
0,“You are not a monster.
0,You are not Princess Eydis.”
0,"Rynn’s soft hands and calm, reassuring voice helped soothe the pain threatening to tear Eydis’s heart apart."
0,I am not Eydis?
0,I am not a monster?
0,Eydis was a Lurr.
0,Lurr were monsters that became what they preyed on.
0,Eydis preyed solely on the princess and was becoming more and more like her.
0,"If I am neither, then… what am I?"
0,The pain in Eydis’s heart lessened but was only replaced by the empty void of confusion.
0,The tears streaming down her cheeks slowed.
0,She sat motionless in Rynn’s arms unable to think any longer.
0,"She was tired, mentally, physically, and emotionally."
0,Rynn led Eydis to her feet and up the steps.
1,"She was about to lead Eydis to the bedroom to rest, but after looking at Eydis’s face stained with tears, she led her to the bathroom."
0,Only then Eydis remembered that she was supposed to be bathing.
0,Rynn removed her dress and undressed Eydis.
0,She ran the water and began washing Eydis.
0,"Eydis did not resist and let Rynn’s gentle, yet meticulous hands wash away her tears."
0,"Rynn even took attention to the dried blood still remaining under Eydis’s fingernails, never asking where it came from."
0,"When finished, Rynn sat at the far end of the tub and leaned Eydis back so that her head rested on Rynn’s belly."
0,"Once more, Rynn ran her fingers through Eydis’s hair and brushed Eydis’s cheek like a mother consoling a troubled child."
0,Eydis’s body relaxed.
0,She was falling into the comfort of the small girl.
0,"When her heavy eyes threatened to close, her senses woke with the fresh smell of blood."
0,Rynn’s caressing ceased when a warm droplet fell onto Eydis’s forehead.
0,Eydis’s eyes shot open and looked up at the young girl to find that the tip of her left horn was bleeding.
0,Rynn touched it and stared at the red stain on her finger.
0,"After righting herself, Eydis was about to touch the raw skin at the tip of Rynn’s horn to stop the bleeding, but Rynn shielded her horn with her hand."
0,“Let it peel.”
0,"Forrest Elf youth were considered adults once the skin on their horns fully peeled, and letting the skin peel naturally was a long-held tradition in most Forrest Elf households."
0,"The natural pattern or shape of the remaining skin on the horn once it finished pealing was seen as another facet of a Forrest Elf woman’s facial beauty, and tampering with the pealing even to help the process could have a negative effect on the final appearance."
0,"Boys’ antlers grew long and fast, so peeling finished quickly, but the process was much longer for girls, lasting half a year at most, and was oftentimes painful."
0,"In rare cases, the bleeding would continue throughout the entire process, leaving the girl weak and anemic until the peeling finished."
0,"Infection of the skin was also a possibility, but that was rare."
0,The early days of peeling were always the worst until the skin encasing the horns died.
0,"Rynn spent most her time alone, so Eydis wanted to help the process in any way she could, but once again Rynn stopped her."
0,"“Do not worry.” Rynn grew a faint smile, the first smile Eydis had seen, but it felt forced."
0,"This was a joyous occasion for any young Forrest Elf, and Eydis understood that Rynn wanted her to be happy as well."
0,"Once the peeling finished, Rynn would be an adult and free to love and start a family if she pleased, but that truth twisted a knot of regret in Eydis’s heart."
0,"Rynn was given as a slave to a man for pleasure, but if Rynn had put that past behind her and was looking forward to her own future, Eydis should as well."
0,Eydis forced a smile in return and kissed Rynn’s cheek to not touch her horns when pressing their foreheads together.
0,“Congratulations.”
0,A genuine grin spread across Rynn’s face.
0,"It was small, but to Eydis it glowed brighter than the noonday sun."
0,Eydis found a small hand towel in the hallway closet to wrap under the base of Rynn’s horns to catch any dripping blood.
0,"Having lost track of time, Eydis knew she had to return or Justin would worry."
0,"“I need to go, but I will be back to celebrate.”"
0,"Rynn nodded, and the faint smile returned."
1,"Back in the bathroom of Justin’s apartment, Eydis found that the water of the shower had been turned off."
0,"She opened the bathroom door slowly, expecting Justin to be waiting angrily because of her unannounced disappearance, but she did not find anyone."
0,She walked to her room and found Justin sitting on the floor where he had been when she left.
0,“I am sorry.
0,"I just needed some time to myself, so I…”"
0,Justin smiled and shook his head.
0,“I’m not mad.
0,I knew something was up because you never use the shower.
0,Remember what I said before?
0,Just talk to me.
0,I won’t understand anything unless you say it.”
0,"Eydis felt that was a lie, because Justin almost had a sixth sense for detecting when she was nervous, worried, or troubled."
0,The events preceding her escape to Rynn’s house flooded back.
0,I accepted Justin as my lover.
0,What am I to do?
0,"Her face grew hot, and she could not find any words to say to him."
0,"She knelt in front of him with her head lowered, submissive, because she did not know how else to approach him now."
0,“Eydis.”
0,“Yes?” Eydis startled and replied by reflex.
0,"“While you were gone, I was thinking about everything you said."
0,"You are probably thinking that things cannot go back to how they were before, and you are probably right.” "
0,Justin grasped Eydis’s hand and gently caressed her knuckles with his thumb.
0,He pulled her over to sit next to him as they were before.
0,"“I don’t know what Jethro and his men did to you, but whatever happened does not define who you are.” "
0,"He turned his head and locked eyes with Eydis, his deep blue eyes like polished sapphires exuding confidence."
0,"“This sounds a bit cliché, but you decide who you are.” "
0,He broke eye contact with a smile and looked forward into nowhere.
0,"“You are worried that everyone will judge you because of what happened, but I certainly won’t."
0,"I can’t speak for Sammy or anyone else, but I don’t think they will either."
0,"If you are still worried, there is a simple answer."
0,Just be yourself.
0,Don’t try to overcompensate for anything.
0,Don’t try to hide your feelings or hold back.
0,Just be yourself.”
0,Be myself?
0,Rynn’s words echoed in Eydis’s mind.
0,“You are not a monster.
0,You are not Princess Eydis.”
0,“I do not think I can be the Eydis you knew…” 
0,I do not even know who I am anymore.
0,"Justin’s chuckle surprised Eydis, cutting her doubtful thoughts short."
0,He wrapped his arm around her shoulder and pulled her closer to rest his head against hers.
0,"“The Eydis I know, huh?"
0,"The Eydis I know gets excited about simple and seemingly pointless things, but after you escaped Jethro, any time you start to grow excited about something, you hold back and grow depressed."
0,It’s okay to be happy.
0,That excitement is you.” 
0,Justin interlocked his fingers with hers and gripped her hand lightly.
0,"“You tried to push Chloe, Miriam, and Sammy away in order to protect them."
0,That concern you have for the safety of those you care about is you.
0,Growing frustrated with the police enough to teleport one of them into the river is also you.
0,I can imagine that there were one or two times you wanted to do that to me as well.” 
0,Justin chuckled again.
0,"“The tapping you do with your feet when you eat something delicious is also you, a part of you I absolutely adore by the way."
0,"Hell, even your outbursts are just as much a part of you as anything else.”"
0,"Eydis felt her face grow hot, and she lowered it in bashful embarrassment."
0,She had not even realized she tapped her feet when eating.
0,Justin lifted their entwined hands and kissed the back of Eydis’s hand.
0,"“When your magic went awry at the range, you immediately shielded Sammy, your closest friend, faster than anyone else could have reacted."
0,You then rushed to Chloe to heal her.
0,You even expended every effort to save the life of the officer that accused you despite how much you hate the police.
0,"You have such a large capacity for kindness, larger than anyone I have ever known."
0,"Your heart is what defines who you are, and despite all that has happened, your heart has not changed.”"
0,"Did you not just list a bunch of things that the princess used to do and that I only do because I am her copy, Eydis thought to herself, wanting to doubt Justin’s honest praise."
0,“I don’t expect things to go back to how they were before Jethro’s men showed up.
0,"We just want you to be yourself again, even if that ‘you’ is a little different after all that has happened.”"
0,"No, What if being similar to the princess is just part of who I am?"
0,“I was in love with you before you were captured just as I am in love with you now.”
0,"I am similar to the princess, but I am not the princess."
0,I am different.
0,A tear ran down Eydis’s cheek.
0,"Justin loves the princess, but he also loves this different Eydis that is not the princess?"
0,Does that mean he really does love me?
0,“I think I understand now…” Eydis spoke softly.
0,I understand why the princess loves you.
0,Eydis wiped away her tear and nuzzled her head against Justin’s.
0,“Thank you.”
0,"She still felt uneasy, but perhaps this could work to her favor."
0,Maybe this was her chance to finally join with the humans of this world and pursue a better life for her and for Rynn.
0,"Justin was kind, and perhaps, just perhaps, she could accept that kindness, even if he was human."
0,The room fell silent.
0,"The minutes passed, and they let the light contact of their heads, shoulders, and interlocked hands speak all that was more to be said."
0,I should not keep Rynn waiting.
0,"“Today has been tiring, so I want to sleep now.”"
0,Justin nodded and planted a light kiss on Eydis’s cheek before standing up.
0,"The sentiment startled Eydis, but what surprised her most was that she was not averse to it like when she had kissed him."
0,"“If there is anything you need, remember to just ask,” Justin said."
0,"“Actually, there is something."
0,Do you still have the cake?
0,I would like to eat it before I sleep.”
0,Justin laughed.
0,“I’ll go get it.”
0,Justin returned with the white box and a fork and handed them to Eydis.
0,He was about to leave the room but stopped.
0,"“If anything is ever troubling you again, please talk to me."
0,I will listen.”
0,He wished Eydis goodnight and left the room.
0,Eydis locked the door and opened a portal back to where Rynn was waiting.
0,Together they shared the chocolate cake to celebrate.
0,"Chapter 10
“Beware those who always seem happy.”
Jethro"
1,A splintered quill scratched ink across a tattered sheet of parchment.
0,"The written letters and sigils were so misshapen that they could only be understood by their author, but even he was having difficulty making out what he wrote."
0,"The lines of ink blurred and faded, ebbed and flowed."
0,"Jethro rubbed his sleep-drunk eyes, smearing even more ink on his face."
0,“This would be so much easier with a sigil draft…”
0,Using pen and paper to work out incredibly complicated spells was an act of futility.
0,Jethro had to commend Emer for his level of skill in spatial magic despite not only the limited magical technology of this world but also their use of lengthy strings of glyphs to express spells on paper instead of condensed sigils.
0,"If Jethro was forced to conduct the research of his youth on paper, he would have given up the profession then and there."
0,"Now, he had no other choice."
0,At least he could draw the sigils when working on his own.
0,"Unable to bear the exhaustion any longer, Jethro sat the broken quill back in the ink well and slouch back in the unstable wooden chair."
0,"The light from the brazier in the small room had long grown dim, only adding to the weight of sleep in his eyes."
0,"Keeya had succumbed to slumber, and so Emer was forced as her host to sleep as well, but Jethro did not mind."
0,He had been working with Emer consistently for days to continue modifying his transmission magic to be used to teleport to the other world.
0,"Earlier that evening, they had finalized the formula."
0,Jethro was only combing it over for errors they may have missed and simplifying it where able to reduce the ven expenditure further.
0,The level of difficulty of this magic was far beyond what Jethro had expected.
0,"Given the complexity of the original trans-world teleportation trace he retrieved from Emer, he had steeled himself for the daunting task in front of him, but what he originally believe was an overestimation of the time and effort required proved to be nothing more than a minute fraction of the actual workload."
0,"Emer’s trans-world teleportation was incredibly complicated, and Jethro’s self-developed transmission magic was no less complicated."
0,Fusing them together created an abomination that Jethro would have never imagined during his days as a young researcher.
0,"But, the fruits of his efforts would pay off."
0,"For what Jethro had planned, this transmission was crucial."
0,All that remained was to test it.
0,“Tomorrow…”
0,Jethro used regular teleportation to return to his room back in Tolmyur in order to not disturb the already sleeping kissiae and half-elf.
1,"The following day, Jethro brought Emer back to the Amelian Palace."
0,"The sight of crude human soldiers patrolling the noble elven hallways would have distressed Emer, but his emotions were overtaken by the kissiae controlling him."
0,"Keeya’s face beamed with excitement not only from her first visit to Amel, but also being able to personally see the interior of the grand Amelian Palace."
0,She rushed Emer from the exquisite tapestries to the crystalline windows.
0,She even took time to admire the fine craftsmanship of each individual door handle.
0,“Can you do something about her?” Emer’s face pressed into a door so that Keeya could get a better look at the door handle over Emer’s shoulder.
0,“Each different?” Keeya rushed even faster from door to door to admire the uniqueness of each handle.
0,Emer’s face slammed into one door after another.
0,"“This is something you will need to get used to, I guess."
0,You and Keeya are one and the same now.”
0,“She could at least learn some body awarene-fmf…” Emer’s face collided with another door.
0,"“That will come with time, I assume."
0,"Keeya, you are falling behind.”"
0,Keeya leaned her head back to look at Jethro who was two doors further down the hallway.
0,She moved Emer to a trot to catch back up but was then immediately distracted again by an intricate cerulean vase with gold engravings between two nearby windows.
0,At least Emer’s face was not pressed into anything while she admired it up close.
0,"“I’m beginning to wonder if she is myopic,” Emer grumbled."
0,"“Doubt it,” Jethro replied."
0,“Eye defects are trivial to cure with life magic.
0,"She is a type of dryad, after all."
0,"Keeya, over here.”"
0,Jethro stopped in front of a single large door near the end of the hall.
0,He opened it and was immediately greeted by a female High Elf.
0,“Is Fect here?
0,I assume his recovery is finished.”
0,The High Elf bowed her head.
0,"“He is not present, my Lord."
0,I would assume he is training in the central courtyard.”
0,The High Elf bowed deeply as Jethro closed the door.
0,“Can we teleport to the courtyard?” Emer asked.
0,“And waste precious ven?
0,We are only going to get a few attempts at this before both of us are out.
0,We need to save what we can.”
0,Jethro only saw Emer’s dejected face for a moment before Keeya whisked him away to admire the vases set between the windows that she had ignored due to her obsession with the door handles.
0,“Each different too!
0,This birds… They are Habha?
0,And this flowers!”
0,"Keeya’s face glowed with excitement, and Jethro could not help but smile at the ancient dryad’s oddly childish demeanor."
1,In the central courtyard a grizzled minum with stripes of white in his beard and along the sides of his head above the ears was engaged in a heated duel against a much younger minum who looked no different than a human child.
0,“They’re at it again.” Jethro leaned on the railing of the walkway surrounding the outer perimeter of the central courtyard to watch Fect and Captain Byurk’s duel.
0,"None of the spectators noticed his presence, so he was able view the fight without someone calling everyone to attention."
0,"“From the look of it, it will be over soon.”"
0,Emer jumped up onto the railing and nearly lost his balance.
0,He held onto the nearby pillar and leaned out so that Keeya could get a better view above the heads of the crowd.
0,"Keeya did not want to miss the action, and her eyes lit up when a deafening explosion rang out in the center of the courtyard."
0,"“Fect is becoming desperate,” Jethro commentated to himself."
0,Fect stood panting in the corner of the square arena.
0,His clothes were drenched and he was splattered with mud from head to toe.
0,"The earth beneath him shook, and in the split second it took him to dive to the side, a stone spike shot up from beneath."
0,Fect was barely able to right himself before the stone liquidated into mud and shot like a spear in his direction.
0,"In desperation, Fect triggered an explosion from his hands to blow away the mud."
0,The explosion threatened to catch some of the spectators in the blast.
0,"The force pushed Fect back, but he was able to roll to a crouch."
0,"Without missing a beat, he focused his eyes on the feet of his opponent."
0,The ground beneath Byurk heated.
0,"Before the pillar of fire could form, the man lifted his pointer and middle fingers, causing a short wall no higher than his waist to grow."
0,"The ground at his feet cooled now that the line of sight broke, and the pillar of fire shot out horizontally from the side of the wall back at Fect, but Fect would not be harmed by his own flame."
0,"Using his other hand, Byurk swiped an upward arch and then pulled his hand down as if pressing something into the ground."
0,An inverted geyser pinned Fect to the ground from above.
0,"Exerting all his efforts, Fect faced both his hands the same direction and expelled a torrent of wind that pushed him out from underneath the high-pressure water."
0,He tumbled from the force of his own attack towards the center of the arena and landed on his back.
0,"Before Fect could stand back up, a stone spear pointed at his neck."
0,“It has been decided.” Jethro hopped the railing and walked towards the group of spectators.
0,“Commanding General present!”
0,All the soldiers immediately stood at attention aside from Fect and Byurk in the center of the arena.
0,Jethro waved his hand.
0,"“At ease, everyone.”"
0,Emer followed Jethro close behind.
0,The dirt around the edges of the arena was in all sorts of disarray.
0,Only the center where Byurk stood had little to no damage.
0,"Even without watching from the beginning, the progression of the fight was obvious."
0,"Fect was on defense from the start, and his opponent never moved a step from the center."
0,"“Captain Byurk, ruthless as always.”"
0,"“You flatter me, Jethro.” "
0,“You do realize Fect was almost killed not that long ago.” 
0,Byurk extended his hand to the winded minum.
0,"“Boy, your father was one of the best fire mages I had the pleasure to fight beside."
0,"Your offense is relentless just like his, but once you lose your initiative and are forced to defend, you crumble."
0,"If you are looking for where to improve, I would begin there.”"
0,Fect wiped the mud from his face and grabbed Byurk’s hand.
0,“Yes sir.”
0,“I have business with Fect.
0,Do you mind?” 
0,"Jethro could easily order Byurk, but his relationship with the minum was not one of commander and officer but of longstanding friends."
0,"If Byurk still had business with Fect, Jethro could wait."
0,Mentoring Fect was also important for the future.
0,"Byurk exchanged glances between Jethro and Emer, and his eyes widened when he saw the kissiae attached to him."
0,His body involuntarily shook the longer his eyes lingered on the kissiae.
0,She had an overwhelming aura that few seemed to notice.
0,"“Of course not,” Byurk answered quickly."
0,He rotated his arms in a large circle and encased Fect in a sphere of water.
0,All the dirt on Fect was removed when he passed through the sphere.
0,Fect then closed his eyes and concentrated.
0,"Steam erupted from his clothes, and he was dry in an instant."
0,“Do you need any medical attention before we leave?” Jethro asked.
0,Fect shook his head.
0,“Then we will be off.
0,"Byurk, I know you are recovering from a major injury as well, but the sooner you can return to your pursuit of the wife in Vallen, the better."
0,"From what I hear, Lieutenant Soppet is having some trouble with the fairy resistance in your absence."
0,We are losing men at a far quicker pace than when you were in command.”
0,“Understood.” Byurk placed his right fist over his heart and began bowing but stopped halfway.
0,"“Sir, about the Vallen campaign…”"
0,“What is it?” 
0,Byurk raised his head and looked around at the many men watching his interaction with Jethro.
0,"“It is nothing,” he said and then finished his bow."
1,Jethro smirked and then walked away.
0,"He knew Byurk disliked leading the campaign, but there was no one he trusted more to accomplish such an extensive campaign with limited troops and resources."
0,The rapid increase in casualties on their side in Byurk’s absence was undeniable evidence that Jethro could not give the responsibility to another.
0,Fect stared back at Captain Byurk in disbelief as he followed Jethro out of the courtyard.
0,He had been overpowered by not only an elderly soldier but an injured one.
0,"Noticing this, Jethro placed his hand on Fect’s head."
0,“Do not let the loss bother you.
0,Byurk sees too much of your father in you.
0,You are not a frontline fighter like him.
0,Your skills are better suited for covert operations.”
0,"“That does not change the fact that if I do get into a fight, I need to be able to scrap on equal ground.” "
0,"“While that may be true, evasion and escape is always a viable option."
0,"Where I came from, fights where you meet your opponent head on are nonexistent."
0,Only attack if you can get the kill.
0,"If you fail, escape and hide until another opportunity presents itself.”"
0,“That sounds awfully cowardly.” 
0,Jethro patted Fect’s head and smiled.
0,"“Ah, but it is the cowards that survive."
0,"If a war can be won by a handful of cowards, is that not better than throwing away thousands of valiant lives?"
0,We would not even be walking in this palace if not for our cowardly assassinations.”
0,“I see.
0,I will practice being more… cowardly.”
0,Jethro laughed.
0,"“I admit, when you say it like that, it does sound rather pathetic.”"
0,Fect sighed and shook his head.
0,The walk to the grand council chamber was long in no small part due to Keeya’s meandering.
0,"Fect joined in Emer’s annoyance, asking Jethro to order her to stop wasting time."
0,"After the fourth request, Jethro gave in and ordered Keeya to stop."
0,"She was immediately heartbroken, so he promised that Emer would give her a full tour of the palace later."
0,Emer’s distraught cries were drowned out by Keeya’s gleeful laughter.
0,“Her cooperation is of utmost importance.
0,"Research has progressed at breakneck pace since I began treating her better,” Jethro explained."
0,“But it is my neck that is breaking.” Emer’s head hung low as if his neck had indeed been broken.
1,"At the throne in the grand council chamber, Jethro removed the stack of parchment containing the completed transmission spell."
0,“Am I to be the test subject?” Concern seeped from Fect.
0,“No.
0,"We will need to find a suitable location for the destination, and having someone familiar with the city will expedite the process."
0,"Once one is found, we will use those coordinates for the transmission.”"
0,Fect exhaled his relief and stood poised to perform his task.
0,"Jethro tore open the abyssal black portal to the other world, and Fect stepped through, but his return was quick."
0,“Close it!”
0,Jethro obeyed with haste.
0,“No good.
0,Very populated.
0,Many eyes were on me when I emerged.”
0,"“Now that they are aware of us, we cannot let any see our portals."
0,"We will be unable to use them once the city guard receives word, and the princess will know where to avoid and when to go into hiding.”"
0,Jethro realized that Emer’s population restriction from the original escape formula was still active.
0,"The portal would open somewhere where people were present, such as on a road, in the city, or in someone’s home."
0,"Adding or removing randomization was as trivial as flipping a switch, but adding and removing randomization restrictions for such a complicated spell was not."
0,"Jethro sat on the throne and worked out the restriction for limiting the population density near the randomized destination to zero while keeping the location of the destination close to the original, hopefully still within or near the city."
0,"During this time, Emer found his way up to the balconies where Keeya admired the unique council chairs."
0,"When Jethro finished, he called Keeya back down and opened another portal."
0,“This should be better.”
0,Fect stepped through with Jethro’s assurance.
0,He took his time before returning.
0,"“I scouted the area, and it looks promising.”"
0,"This just proves how important destination restrictions are, Jethro reminded himself."
0,“It is a wooded area on the edge of the city.
0,"There are some houses not too far away, but from the foliage growth and ground cover, no one travels through here."
0,"So long as we keep the portal small, I do not believe anyone will notice when it appears, especially because most the properties are surrounded by high wood-plank fences or tall shrubs.”"
0,"“The location sounds ideal, but will sound be an issue?”"
0,Fect grew confused.
0,Jethro realized that he may be unfamiliar with transmission.
0,"To use the least amount of ven as possible, Jethro transmitted himself from the throne to just beside it."
0,"Fect realized what he meant, the loud snap and flash of light."
0,“Will this be an issue at the destination?” Jethro asked again.
0,"“The sound shouldn’t be an issue at the distance the exit is from the houses,” Fect mused, “but the flash will if used at night."
0,We will need to be careful when using it at night.”
0,“Their days are almost exactly half of ours.
0,"It should still be early afternoon, correct?”"
0,"“From the sun, closer to late morning or midday.” "
0,“So a little longer than half.
0,Odd… The original reports stated they were shorter.
0,Unless the days change in length throughout the year.
0,What would cause that?
0,Perhaps it is only a change in daylight.
0,That would be easier to explain.” 
0,Fect and Emer stared confusedly at Jethro.
0,“I will keep that in mind.
0,It is not important for now.
0,Go back and await the transmission.
0,Return with whoever comes through.”
0,Fect did as ordered and stepped back into the black portal.
0,“Here is the destination.
0,You will be first to cast.” 
0,Jethro touched the Kissiae’s hand attached to Emer’s head and sent the destination via the magic’s trace.
0,“Am I to send myself?” 
0,Emer’s tone did not reject the idea outright.
0,“You are far too valuable.
0,Sending a soldier would likewise be a waste.
0,"With Austin missing, I guess this would be the best option."
0,They are no longer needed.”
0,Emer opened a portal and reached his arm in.
0,"“I thought you said we should not waste any unneeded ven,” Emer complained."
0,"“With the destination set, we know the exact number of times we can cast it."
0,I can afford this much.” 
0,"Jethro simply enjoyed watching Keeya run Emer around the palace, but he kept that to himself."
0,Jethro pulled out a fairy woman from the portal.
0,She yelped in surprise seeing Emer’s grotesque form and almost fell backwards.
0,Jethro yanked her arm to force her to stand.
0,“Use her.”
0,Jethro threw the woman in front of Emer who extended his hand towards her.
0,"Not knowing what would follow, the woman gazed up at the grotesque body with fear and pleading."
0,"A loud snap, and she vanished."
0,Small pieces of flesh that had failed to travel remained on the marble floor.
0,Fect returned dragging a limp and bloody body through the black portal.
0,"The fairy’s limbs were not only broken in many places, but she was also covered in lacerations, one of which cut deep into her neck."
0,The transmission was fatal.
0,“Move the body to the side.
0,"We will clean them up later,” Jethro ordered."
0,Fect looked despairingly at the mutilated woman only slightly taller than him.
0,"Just as High Elves closely resembled humans, fairies resembled minums."
0,Only small differences in their appearance set them apart.
0,The mild remorse for the perfectly wasted woman was only countered by the relief that he was not the test subject.
0,“What do you make of it?” Jethro asked Emer.
0,Emer stared at the body with remorse.
0,He did not expect such a gruesome end for the poor woman.
0,"But, he had seen these types of injuries before, many times."
0,“The stability function did not last for the duration of the transmission.”
0,“I concur.
0,We will need to revise it a little.”
0,Emer and Jethro scanned through the parchment where the stability function was written.
0,Emer noticed something almost immediately.
0,“Did you make modifications?”
0,“I only made a few simplifications to reduce ven expenditure.
0,The resulting spell should be the same.”
0,Emer shook his head and pointed to a string of glyphs.
0,"“This appears to have the same functionality on the outside, but the underlying workings are different.”"
0,He then pointed to another line of glyphs further up the parchment.
0,“What you have written below causes distortion over distance with this passage.
0,"If this were a normal teleportation, the distortion would be negligible, but we do not know just how far the other world is from ours."
0,"As the subject travels, the distortion grows."
0,This could cause the stability to collapse.”
0,Jethro removed a quill and corked ink-vial from his robe.
0,He flipped the parchment over and worked out the stability sigils for the unmodified version and his simplified version.
0,The two sigils looked identical.
0,There was no difference.
0,Maybe this world’s glyphs are far more accurate than I thought.
0,"This level of spatial magic is unknown in my world, so this minor of a distinction might have never been noticed."
0,“Let us return to the original.
0,"Your knowledge of spatial magic has once again proven superior to mine.” Jethro had to remind himself that even though Emer looked half his age, Emer was four or five times older, and that meant over five times the experience he had in spatial magic."
0,"Fect was sent back to the other world, and Jethro pulled out the next test subject."
0,"The High Elf was frightened by Emer’s appearance just as the fairy was, but then she covered her mouth and her eyes welled with tears."
0,“Emer?”
0,“Dyas?” 
0,Emer extended his palm towards her out of no control of his own.
0,The High Elf noticed the mutilated fairy on the cold marble floor beside her.
0,"She shook her head in fear, too scared to speak."
0,"“Jethro, please stop Keeya!” Emer tried to resist with all his will but couldn’t stop."
0,"With a loud crack, she vanished."
0,“Someone you know?” Jethro asked after waiting for Emer to send her off to the other world.
0,Emer gritted his teeth.
0,His extended hand fell limp to his side.
0,“Dyas… She was my personal maid.
0,I’ve known her since she was a young girl in training.
0,She was in charge of my office and personal quarters and would often help me with my research in her spare time.
0,Her mind is brilliant.
0,She could have been better use to us than this.”
0,“You should have spoken up quicker.” 
0,"“I did, but you only stood there!"
0,Do you take me for a fool?!
0,She never cared about my position or the differences in our status.
0,"From a young age, she would always joke that one day I would take her to wife.” "
0,Emer’s face contorted in anguish but immediately calmed.
0,"“Thank you, Keeya."
0,"In that state, he probably would not have been able to concentrate enough to continue."
0,Let us hope she survived then.”
0,Fect appeared from the black portal dragging a limp body behind him.
0,"Unlike the fairy, there was no visible damage."
0,“This is an improvement.
0,"Emer, check her vitals,” Jethro ordered."
0,Fect spoke up before Emer could.
0,“She’s dead.
0,Her heart has stopped.”
0,Emer ignored Fect and knelt next to the body.
0,He placed his hand on her forehead and then on her chest.
0,"When he began using life magic in a desperate attempt to revive her, Jethro stopped him."
0,“I would rather you save your ven.”
0,“Please.
0,We do not need to do all the testing today.”
0,"“The longer we wait, the more time the princess has to prepare as well."
0,You have one chance.
0,"After that, we move on.”"
0,"Now with Jethro’s permission, Emer began his struggle to save the woman’s life."
0,"His emotions were still repressed by Keeya, but the trembling of his hands showed his desperation."
0,Life magic had no effect.
0,Emer placed his hand on her chest and released an intense shock that caused the body to jolt.
0,He repeated twice more and then placed his hand on her mouth to force air into her lungs.
0,"After two more shocks, Jethro ordered him to stop, and Fect dragged the body next to the Fairy’s."
0,“Wait.
0,Can you please ask Keeya to try?
0,I beg you.”
0,Jethro shook his head.
0,Emer could only stare at the floor unable to express sorrow or rage.
0,The corner of Jethro’s lips curled upwards.
0,"“Sorry about your loss, but such is the nature of experimentation."
0,Let us look over the spell.
0,Stability does not appear to be the issue this time.”
0,Emer resisted answering.
0,"He wanted nothing more to do with the experiment, but Keeya was the one in control."
0,"“Stability is still the issue,” he was forced to say."
0,"“While not visible on the outside, Dyas’s body showed signs of significant internal trauma."
0,"I healed it, but that wasn’t enough."
0,The magic is still placing too much strain on the body.”
0,“Can you identify the cause from the formula?” 
0,Emer scanned over the parchment and shook his head.
0,“I see…” Jethro created another portal and pulled out a Forrest Elf woman by her arm.
0,"“Instead of healing this one, I want you to investigate the damage done to help us determine the cause of the trauma.”"
0,The Forrest Elf cowered from Jethro’s ominous words.
0,She noticed the mutilated fairy and dead High Elf.
0,The strength of her legs gave out.
0,“Please… no… I’ll do anything.”
0,Jethro ignored the woman’s plea.
0,“How many more times can you cast it?”
0,“I just have enough for three more attempts.” 
0,“Perfect.”
0,"Emer extended his palm toward the terrified woman, and she vanished."
0,Fect stepped through his black portal to retrieve the body on the other side.
0,He returned with the woman in the same condition as the High Elf.
0,"“Investigate thoroughly,” Jethro ordered."
0,Emer placed his hand on the woman’s forehead.
0,"He remained silent for a long time, but Jethro waited patiently."
0,"Without healing the damage like Emer had before, faint bruising slowly appeared all over the woman’s body."
0,"Seeing this, Jethro knelt down and inspected the bruising skin of her arm."
0,"“I don’t understand,” Emer finally spoke."
0,"The trauma, it is as if she was hit with some incredible force evenly all over her body, yet there is no physical damage on the outside.”"
0,“What is the damage to the inner ear and lungs?” 
0,“Her ears are ruptured to a degree I have never seen before.
0,The damage is severe enough that the blood is pooling in the inner ear instead of running out.
0,The lungs have severe tissue damage and are flooded with blood.
0,Both arteries and bronchial tubes have ruptured.”
0,“Of course!
0,There is little chance anyone here would know these symptoms.
0,Overpressure.”
0,Emer looked to Jethro for an explanation.
0,"“When you are near an explosion caused by fire magic, you feel a force pushing you back, but it is comparatively weak."
0,"When an explosion is produced chemically, the force from those blasts can be much, much greater depending on the reaction."
0,"When atomic, the blast is greater still."
0,"Where I am from, we have weapons capable of not only killing with the force alone but also destroying entire cities if needed.”"
0,Emer’s eyes grew wide.
0,"“She died from a blast injury cause by overpressure, that wave of force."
0,"Fect, was there any large explosion at the exit when she appeared?”"
0,"“None, just a flash of light and a little noise."
0,It was actually more silent than the transmission you demonstrated to me.”
0,"“The greatest noise only happens at the origin after all.” Tired of kneeling, Jethro sat on the ground and folded his arms."
0,“At what point was the force felt?
0,"When going through the regular portal, do you feel any pressure or force?”"
0,"“None, but there is a small bit of resistance, almost as if wading through mud."
0,It wraps around you.
0,I cannot describe it well.
0,I have never felt anything like it outside of that portal.”
0,“Perhaps similar to a weakened teleportation barrier?” 
0,“I wouldn’t know.” 
0,“Resistance… What if all that resistance was placed on the body at once and compounded due to the near instantaneous nature of transmission?
0,"It is just a theory, but this problem may not be something we can solve through modifying the spell.”"
0,“Then we will be ending the experiment?” Emer asked.
0,“Hardly.
0,I have an idea.” Jethro stood and created another portal.
0,He reached in and pulled out a Mountain Elf.
0,"She looked at Emer, the dead bodies, and then at Jethro."
0,"“Jethro, what is the meaning of this?” she demanded."
0,"“Just running a few experiments, and you are the next subject.”"
0,Fect entered his portal.
0,"“Jil, Dyas, Wian, what did you do to them?!"
0,Emer!
0,Even Dyas?
0,What did you do?!”
0,Emer’s face remained emotionless due to Keeya’s emotional repression.
0,He could only shake his head and offer a heartless apology.
0,"“I am sorry, Symra.”"
0,A stone blade grew instantly in Symra’s hand.
0,She swung her arm with quick and practiced motion towards Jethro’s neck.
0,Jethro stepped back in mild surprise.
0,The stone shattered against his barrier.
0,"“If I am to die here, I will at least take you with me!” "
0,"The Mountain Elf struck her palm into Jethro’s barrier, and when her stance locked, the barrier shattered to Jethro’s surprise."
0,"The ven in her strike disrupted the ven of his barrier, forcing recoil that numbed his arms."
0,Jethro extended his hand before a second stone blade could reach his throat.
0,"The space in front of him rejected Symra, launching her back into one of the pillars of the council balcony."
0,It cracked on impact.
0,"Symra fell to the marble floor but staggered back to her feet, two new blades in her hands."
0,She did not shred apart from Jethro’s attack as he expected.
0,She was not even as broken as when he used it on the princess’s doppelganger.
0,She was more resilient than a Lurr.
0,Reinforcement magic.
0,She was an earth mage.
0,Jethro’s new magic did have a weakness it seemed.
0,The Mountain Elf’s little rebellion proved quite educational.
0,Symra’s steps were slow.
0,"She coughed up blood and fell to one knee, stabbing one of her blades into the marble floor for support."
0,Perhaps her internal damage was greater.
0,Jethro locked her in a barrier and drug her over.
0,"“You will not kill me so easily,” she seethed."
0,She glared at the man who caused the deaths of the women she had suffered with through humiliation and torment to protect others from the same fate.
0,"“The whole point of this experiment is for you to survive, so your cooperation is much appreciated,” Jethro said with a smile."
0,"“Keeya, heal her.”"
0,“You are allowing Keeya to heal Symra but not Dyas?” 
,"Even though Emer showed no emotion, Jethro knew he was raving inside."
0,Or perhaps Emer couldn’t feel any anger.
0,Jethro did not fully understand how Keeya’s emotional suppression worked.
0,A small smile grew on Jethro’s lips.
0,“This is different.
0,How could we tell the damage the transmission caused if she is already injured?”
0,Emer placed his hand on various locations on Symra’s body while she struggled to break her arms and legs free from the barrier that bound her.
0,"Keeya healed her through Emer, using his body as a conduit for her life magic."
0,The barrier locking Symra’s arms and legs warped and condensed tight around her entire body.
0,"“For your sake, I hope this works,” Jethro said."
0,"Emer extended his hand, and Symra vanished."
0,"After a moment, Fect returned through the portal pulling Symra with his arms hooked under her rigid shoulders."
0,She remained frozen in the pose the barrier locked her.
0,Her eyes found Jethro and glared at him.
0,She was alive.
0,“Perfect!” Jethro spun in place and pumped his fist.
0,"“Emer, check her condition.”"
0,Emer placed his hand on her chest but could not make contact.
0,“The barrier.”
0,“Of course.” 
0,"Jethro removed the barrier, and Symra collapsed to the ground from the odd angle Fect held her."
0,She shoved Fect away sending him sliding across the smooth marble but then found her arms and legs restrained again before she could attack.
0,Emer placed his hand on her back.
0,“No damage.
0,It was a success.”
0,"“To think that a simple barrier to protect against the force, or in this case resistance, was all that was needed."
0,But we must make sure it always works.
0,We may have just gotten lucky.
0,We shall continue until we are out of ven.”
0,The invisible force binding Symra pulled her up to stand and then encased her body.
0,Emer sent her back to the other world two more times to finish draining his ven.
0,Jethro estimated he would be able to send her fifteen times.
0,"The black portal began to waver, so Jethro recreated it to ensure Fect’s safety."
0,“I guess I only have seven more attempts now.” This drastic difference in ven expenditure was the sole reason Jethro needed the new transmission formula.
0,"Fect returned to the other world, and Symra followed by transmission."
0,"She continued returning unharmed for the fourth and fifth attempt, building Jethro’s confidence in the safety of the formula and his remedy against the overpressure."
0,"On the sixth attempt, Fect flew out the black rift and tumbled to a stop at Jethro’s feet."
0,"He had a large red abrasion on his face, and his nose bled."
0,“That troll got away!” Fect dove back through the portal.
0,"After a long wait, he returned emptyhanded."
0,“Did you find her?” Jethro asked.
0,"“No, sir."
0,"I couldn’t find a trace, not even footprints."
0,She must have jumped from tree to tree.”
0,"“How did she attack you?” “The last time you sent her, she appeared injured."
0,She was not restrained in your barrier.”
0,Jethro patted himself lightly on the forehead.
0,“I was careless.
0,Of course the overpressure would damage the barrier and weaken it over time.
0,I should have renewed the barrier after each attempt.
0,"But then, I would have lost the last attempt or so anyway."
0,No matter.
0,I would call this an astounding success.
0,One more elfkind over there will not cause us any trouble.
0,Now all that remains is a bit of information on our enemy.” Jethro removed the handgun from his belt.
0,"“Fect, I need you to learn just how effective the weapons from that world are against our magic."
0,I should finish my preparations in ten days.
0,I expect a full report then.
0,"I cannot risk anyone inexperienced to go to that world right now with them on high alert, so you will be on your own."
0,Can you manage this?”
0,Fect wiped the blood from his nose.
0,“Yes sir.”
0,"“Also, if you encounter the doppelganger, try not to kill her."
0,She may still be of use to us.
0,"Of course, your own life takes priority over hers.” "
0,Jethro created a small portal and pulled out a bag of provisions to give Fect.
0,"Once Fect was through the portal, Jethro closed it."
1,He stretched his arms behind his back and then shook them to loosen up.
0,They still felt numb from the troll destroying his barrier.
0,"“I would say that went quite well, would you?”"
0,"Emer stared at the three dead bodies, and his eyes lingered on the High Elf, Dyas."
0,“How about that palace tour now?” Jethro announced.
0,"Keeya’s eyes perked up, and Emer quickly ran to Jethro’s side."
0,“Why are you doing this…?” Emer asked with a mournful voice.
0,“The tour?
0,Did we not promise Keeya we would?”
0,Emer gritted his teeth in anger.
0,"Keeya was no longer controlling his emotions, having forgotten to do so after Jethro mentioned the tour."
0,“What purpose do you have in continuing to target that world?
0,Why are you still trying to kill Princess Eydis?
0,You already won the war!
0,All the races within the Amelian Empire have surrendered themselves to you!
0,Can you not leave her be in that world?
0,She has no means to come back.”
0,Jethro stopped walking.
0,He turned back to look down at Emer’s angry face.
0,"“For one who lives so long, your mind is too focused on the short term."
0,"I will only live another three to four years by your world’s time, maybe less."
0,What happens then?
0,"If I choose a successor, he will only live another three to four years after that."
0,You elves live for eighty or more years.
0,"If I am not thorough in dousing the remaining embers of this empire, in just two or three human generations, all my work here could be undone while you are still in the prime of your life.” "
0,Jethro placed his hand on Emer’s shoulder and burned holes into Emer’s eyes with his glare.
0,"Keeya turned her head away, trying to distance herself from Jethro’s rebuke of Emer."
0,"Emer shook, and Jethro could not tell whether this was due to Keeya’s fear or Emer’s."
0,He hoped it was both.
0,His next words applied equally to both of them.
0,"“Having been in a position of power, I am sure you know the true history between the humans and the elves."
0,Eliminating the royal family is only the beginning of the elves’ suffering.
0,"As for the princess, I have personal reasons to make her suffer."
0,"The Coastal War is one, but the other…” "
0,The fury in Jethro’s eyes grew until Emer feared he would run him through that instant.
0,Jethro’s anger was far greater talking about the princess than when he mentioned the elves’ betrayal of the humans in ancient past.
0,Jethro flashed a smile and walked out of the grand council chamber.
0,Neither Keeya nor Emer could move.
0,"“Come, Keeya."
0,"Let us begin our tour,” Jethro called."
0,"Keeya hurried Emer to catch up but kept a full five paces behind him, at least until something caught her attention and sent Emer running around again."
0,"Chapter 11
Eydis
“A Moment of Clarity”"
1,This is bad… 
0,Eydis knelt next to the unconscious elf in the floor of the cellar.
0,The body was dangerously warm and would not cool no matter what life magic Eydis tried.
0,"In Eydis’s anger, she had abused the already weak elf and even threw her head into the solid pavement floor."
0,"The princess’s skull fractured, and there was internal bleeding in both her stomach and head."
0,"When Eydis discovered the princess’s condition the morning after her violent tirade, she addressed it to the best of her ability and continued tending to the princess over the past week."
0,"The damage healed, but the body did not recover."
0,It reacted adversely and broke out into a terrible fever.
0,The princess’s body was not replenishing its blood supply at an adequate rate.
0,"Her breath was weak, and her heart rate was weaker."
0,"Her body began converting all its ven to the life element in order to keep itself alive, but her ven recovery was already slow from her feeble condition, and she was not recovering enough to support her body’s self-preservation."
0,She could not rise above critical ven levels.
0,The princess was dying.
0,What am I supposed to do?
0,I am not complete yet.
0,"If I knew how to transfer my own ven into her, that could help, but…"
0,"Eydis was about to place her hand on the body to try and give it ven, but hesitated."
0,"If I touch her, I will only take more ven from her."
0,"Every attempt to supply the princess with ven had failed, leaving the princess with less ven than before."
0,“Is she beyond help?” Rynn crouched next to Eydis.
0,The skin on the tip of her other horn was now peeling like the first.
0,The rag around her forehead at the base of her horns was already stained brown from the dried blood that had dripped onto it throughout the morning.
0,Eydis could not answer.
0,She did not know.
0,"“I will watch her,” Rynn said."
0,“You must go.
0,They are waiting for you.”
0,Justin had informed Eydis that the FBI understood the events of the last combat magic lesson and gave permission for its continuation.
0,Today was the day of that lesson.
0,“I have no choice but to leave her to you.
0,I cannot even touch her.”
0,"“I will try and keep her cool,” Rynn promised."
1,Eydis opened a portal and returned to the small bathroom of Justin’s apartment.
0,"After a brief apology for the long wait, she, Justin, and Sean left for the police station."
0,"Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam met them there."
0,Major Wickenny greeted everyone beside Agent Botteger and two police who were not present at the last lesson.
0,"One of them was Officer Hellings, appearing less smug than Eydis remembered."
0,Perhaps her irritation from her mistaken confinement soured her initial impressions of the policewoman.
0,What surprised everyone but Justin and Eydis was the presence of three more people who were not police or FBI.
0,"Eydis had talked to them over the phone, but this was their first meeting."
0,"She had seen other humans like him in the city, but she was surprised by just how dark the man’s skin was."
0,"Human breeds in Whinhlem were distinguishable by their stature and build, but human breeds on Earth seemed to differentiate by hair and skin color."
0,Agent Botteger introduced the new additions.
0,"“This is Colonel Richards, Post Commander of Fort Samper."
0,The Army will be accompanying us with Eydis’s permission.”
0,"“I’m surprised you agreed to do another one of these,” Sammy said, “but you are even letting the military watch?” "
0,Eydis smiled and placed her hand on Sammy’s shoulder with a light pat.
0,“I want you to be as prepared as possible in case you run into Jethro’s men.
0,This was part of the agreement to let us continue using the range.”
0,“As long as you are up to it.” 
0,"“We can stop at any time if you no longer feel confident,” Major Wickenny assured, and Agent Botteger agreed."
0,“A mistake like before will not happen again.” 
0,Eydis’s confidence raised the morale of everyone present.
0,"She had to reserve her ven with the princess in such a state, so large-scale spells were prohibited."
0,"So long as she did not use too much ven, she could stay in contact with Justin to recover what she used."
0,"Justin’s regeneration rate was astounding, so she relied heavily on him to replenish her supply, unknown to him."
0,Thankfully he never seemed to notice the syphoning of his ven.
1,The setup for the training took longer than before.
0,"Large glass screens were placed out for the spectators, and those involved with the actual training were required to wear thick black vests, helmets, and eye protection."
0,Eydis eyed them with suspicion.
0,“Is that glass strong enough to protect them if something goes wrong?”
0,Justin shrugged.
0,"“It stops bullets similar to your barrier before, so it should help.”"
0,“What about those vests?” 
0,“My guess is that these are Kevlar.
0,"They stop bullets as well, so they should provide some protection.”"
0,One of the police handed Eydis a vest and helmet.
0,She inspected the vest but thought that it would be weaker than armor because she could not feel any metal.
0,Agent Botteger then handed Eydis the strange eye protection.
0,"“Part of what we planned for today is testing just how protective these are against magic,” he explained."
0,“And that will be my job while the others practice?”
0,“If you would.” 
0,"This may be difficult depending on how much they want me to test, but they did say that I can stop when I feel like it."
0,“Gladly.”
0,"Justin, Sammy, Miriam, and Chloe stood in line at the edge of the range."
0,"This time, Sean stood with the spectators behind the glass screens."
0,"The appearance of everyone in their protective gear gave the feel of actual military training, although Eydis had never witnessed any personally."
0,"Eydis cleared her throat, took a breath, and then bowed her head."
0,“I must apologize.”
0,Only the cold wind could be heard across the range.
0,"Eydis slowly lifted her head, hoping everyone would react reasonably to what she was about to say."
0,“I cannot teach you how to fight using your elements.”
0,"Whispers grew from among the spectators, but Justin and the others remained silent."
0,“I cannot teach you because I cannot use those elements.
0,I have never trained with them in combat.
0,I have only fought against them.
0,What I can do is give you direction as you discover how to fight using your own individual elements.”
0,A smile grew across Justin’s face.
0,He had given her some advice after their conversation a week ago.
0,"“If you don’t know how to do something, just say so."
0,We will respect that.”
0,Eydis smiled back at Justin.
0,He must have suspected that I would not be able to teach them.
0,"But, that does not mean I have nothing to offer."
0,"“First, I want you to tell me everything you can do with your element, even if I already know it."
0,I suspect you all have been practicing on your own.
0,I will be better able to direct you after that.
0,“Justin first.”
0,"Justin shook his head, but his smile never faded."
0,“Still useless.
0,"I’ve been meditating to feel my ven, but all I can do is slow time by reflex.”"
0,“Sammy?” 
0,Sammy flashed a guilty smile.
0,"“You already know I’ve been practicing while swimming, but other than that, I can produce more water than before.”"
0,Sammy held both hands in front of her like she was holding a small ball.
0,"As she spread her hands apart, a sphere of water grew between her hands until it became about the size of her head."
0,"Once it grew bigger than that, it lost its form and fell to the ground."
0,Sammy jumped back so that her clothes would not get wet from the splash.
0,Whispers grew from the military--their first witness of magic.
0,“Miriam?”
0,"“I have been practicing trying to change the shape of the rocks I can produce, but it’s not easy.” "
0,Miriam held out her hand.
0,A misshapen cube grew from small granules.
0,She then tossed the cube out into the range.
0,"It flew over the length of the range, hit the embankment on the far side, and imbedded itself into the dirt."
0,"Justin, Sammy, and Chloe stared at Miriam in amazement."
0,It was a throw much stronger than what should have been possible for any human.
0,"“I also found out that if I concentrate ven on one side of it like you taught me on my hand, I can make the ven shoot out and launch the rock.”"
0,“Incredible.
0,You discovered that on your own?
0,That is the same principle behind throwing the wind spear you saw before.”
0,"“Oh, and I can coat earth ven over my entire body now, and I’ve been working on making it stronger because that wind attack that hit me still hurt like a bitch.” "
0,“Miriam! We promised not to talk about that!”
0,Miriam waved her hands apologetically at Chloe.
0,"“It is fine,” Eydis said, unperturbed."
0,“It was my mistake after all.
0,"Now, what about you, Chloe?”"
0,Chloe grew silent.
0,She fidgeted in embarrassment.
0,"After seeing Miriam’s improvement, Eydis understood being nervous."
0,“You do not have to worry if you have not been practicing on your own.
0,Fire is dangerous.”
0,Chloe shook her head.
0,"After a deep breath, she removed her protective gear, coat, and pulled off her shirt."
0,All she wore on her upper body was a tight black sleeveless top that exposed her stomach and some of her cleavage.
0,Eydis guessed that its purpose was to contain her large breasts to prevent them from moving too much when active.
0,“Chloe?
0,What are you doing?” Even Sammy grew concerned.
0,Chloe walked away from the group and passed Eydis.
0,"Once she was twice the distance from Eydis as Eydis was from the others, she turned her side to everyone and took what looked like a melee combat stance with elbows locked in and fists raised."
0,"All at once, her arms from her hands up to just past her elbows grew flames."
0,Eydis immediately recalled the fire mage she fought the night she captured the princess.
0,It cannot be.
0,There is no way an amateur could sustain hand-to-hand combat while controlling her fire.
0,Chloe shot a quick blade-handed jab with her left followed by a straight punch with her right.
0,"When her right hand fully extended, the fire shot out in a line about two times the length of her arm."
0,She was not controlling the flame.
0,The cycle of jabs and punches continued.
0,"Some of the jabs started creating minor bursts of fire, and the distance the fire flew from the punches grew as Chloe moved."
0,"When she turned and swung her elbow, the fire grew in a large arc out to her side."
0,"The fire on her arms grew larger and larger, and Eydis grew worried."
0,"If she did not stop, Eydis feared her fire would grow out of control."
0,"Eydis was about to create a barrier to cut off the air to Chloe’s arms to starve the flames, but Chloe planted her feet firmly on the ground with her right foot forward."
0,She swung both her hands wide and brought them together in a clap.
0,The growing fire on her arms concentrated at the tips of her fingers and generated an explosion that blasted outward.
0,It shook the ground and blew away the rock and dirt in front of her.
0,It had incredible power.
0,Eydis was dumbstruck.
0,Her mind could not even process what she saw enough to think of a response.
0,Everyone who witnessed it was equally stunned silent.
0,Chloe walked back to her shirt and coat but did not place them on.
0,"Her body radiated visible heat, distorting the air around her."
0,She was sweating profusely and looked terribly exhausted.
0,Only once she finally sat on the cold ground could Eydis work out something to say.
0,“Are you really an amateur?”
0,“Chloe!” Sammy ran over to Chloe but could not get too close.
0,“She’s way too hot!
0,"Here, some water.”"
0,Sammy produced water and tried to hold it close.
0,"“Drop it on me,” Chloe ordered."
0,Sammy held the head-sized sphere of water higher and dropped it on top of Chloe.
0,"Steam erupted in all directions, clouding the air."
0,"After a few more spheres of water, the steam stopped, and Chloe cooled down."
0,"The cold air now chilled her, so she pulled back on her coat despite being wet."
0,“What was that?” Eydis called.
0,“When did you find the time to practice it?
0,"WHERE did you practice it?” She walked up to the group, still stunned by Chloe’s performance."
0,Chloe leaned her head back and shook it lightly.
0,“I didn’t practice it.
0,Well… not physically.”
0,"“What do you mean,” Eydis asked after reaching Chloe."
0,How can one do that without practice?
0,She even knew when her own fire was growing too large and how to expel it.
0,“Who are you?”
0,Chloe chuckled.
0,“A while ago I was watching anime and saw something called image training where you practice things in your mind that you cannot practice otherwise.
0,"You taught me how to fight, and I learned to coat myself with fire from how you taught Miriam how to coat her body with earth ven."
0,I just practiced putting them together in my head.
0,"This was the first time I actually used it, though.”"
0,Is this girl some magic genius?
0,How is that even possible?
0,“How did you know your fire was growing too big and how to disperse that built up energy?”
0,“I kind of just felt it?
0,"My body was getting too hot, and even though I was controlling the fire away from my clothes, I was afraid they would catch fire."
0,I got the idea to focus all the ven to the tips of my fingers and then expel it like Miriam’s explanation on how she threw the rock that far.
0,"You were ready to step in in case it didn’t work, so, well… I thought I might as well try.”"
0,"This girl was not only gifted with magic, but she also had the combat sense to be aware of her surroundings enough to realize that Eydis was about to intervene."
0,"And in all that, she was concentrating enough to keep the heat off her clothes."
0,Chloe’s final attack was powerful enough to compete with the princess magically.
0,A tinge of panic struck Eydis’s back as if someone shot her from behind.
0,"The police were afraid when she used powerful magic, and now a human of their world used magic even stronger than her."
0,Eydis looked behind her to the glass screens.
0,"By agreement, the spectators were not to leave from behind their cover until Eydis gave them permission."
0,Colonel Richards looked directly at Eydis and motioned with his hand for Eydis to go to them.
0,"“Chloe, head over to the military."
0,I will follow shortly.”
0,The chatter between Chloe and the others ceased.
0,She nodded and walked over.
0,Worry grew on everyone’s faces.
0,“I will not let them do anything to her.
0,But for now…”
0,What should I have them do?
0,"“Miriam, create a stone.”"
0,Miriam complied.
0,Eydis grabbed it and squeezed.
0,"The pressure she applied was excessive, and the rock broke into powder."
0,The ease of how it broke startled Miriam.
0,“Too weak.
0,"For now, focus on making the stone harder."
0,They will be useless if they break so easily.
0,Sammy.” Eydis did not even know how Sammy could fight if she could not conjure ice.
0,“You need to find a way to use your water to attack; something that fits you.
0,I cannot give you much direction until you figure that out.”
0,Last was Justin.
0,He had a rare affinity but was unskilled with it.
0,How was he spending his time in all the training sessions before?
0,"Not coming to any answer, Eydis shook her head."
0,“Just do what you usually do.”
0,Justin grew a smile.
0,“Figured as much.”
0,Was that normal?
0,Was the princess also at a loss with him?
0,“Looks like we’re back to normal lessons.” 
0,"Sammy laughed, and Justin and Miriam joined in."
1,"Relieved that they accepted her instructions, Eydis hurried over to where the military was talking with Chloe."
0,“…Interesting.
0,"And how long have you been training your fire magic?” Colonel Richards was already questioning Chloe, but his tone was not antagonistic."
0,He almost sounded excited albeit suppressed to maintain the appearance of a ranking military officer.
0,Or so Eydis assumed.
0,“Only a few months.”
0,“And have the others had the same amount of practice?” Chloe nodded.
0,Eydis placed her hand on Chloe’s shoulder.
0,She was still rather hot to the touch.
0,“Her rate of growth is not normal.
0,I was surprised by what Miriam accomplished and would even consider her growth exceptional.”
0,Perhaps the princess is a far better instructor than I realized.
0,Either that or these women have inborn talent.
0,"Sammy’s level of growth seems normal, though."
0,"And rare elements are very difficult to grasp without a proper instructor, so Justin’s lack of ability could be explained."
0,Colonel Richards spoke Eydis’s name to break her out of her internal dialogue.
0,"“As you are aware, we will help track down and combat the terrorists that are targeting you."
0,"After what I have seen, there is another service we can provide."
0,"I do not intend to monitor or restrict Chloe’s actions, and there is no training or licensing for use of magic."
0,"I would like to volunteer our time to train your students, especially Chloe, in combat safety."
0,Would it be permissible for me to take time at the end of your lessons to instruct them?”
0,"He did not want unintended casualties, and Chloe’s lack of restraint over her fire still worried Eydis."
0,“You may have as much time as needed.”
0,“Much appreciated.” 
0,“No. Thank you for being reasonable.
0,I do not want Chloe to be a danger to others.”
0,“I’ll do my best to be careful…” 
0,Chloe had at some point in the conversation removed a bar from her coat pocket and was snacking on it.
0,"When she finished with it, she pocketed the wrapper and removed another."
0,"“Chloe, for your practice, I want you to try and increase and decrease the intensity of the fire on your arms."
0,Keep the heat low.
0,Learn how to keep it under control so that you do not have to expel it all at once.”
0,“Okay.” Chloe pushed the rest of the bar into her mouth and trotted over to where the others were practicing.
0,“Make sure to keep your distance from them!”
0,“Okay!” 
0,"“This is going much better than last time,” Major Wickenny stated while watching the group practice in the distance."
0,“I was not in my right mind then.
0,"With all that has happened, my thoughts were elsewhere worrying about everything."
0,"Justin gave me a stern lecture, and we argued a bit, but he helped me realize many things.”"
0,“That is the benefit of having a good partner.” 
0,"Eydis’s face grew warm, and she involuntarily smiled."
0,"“Miss FeAmel, now that your students are practicing, do you mind helping us,” Agent Botteger asked."
0,“Of course not.
0,"They should be fine without supervision, and I can teleport to them in an emergency."
0,This is the least I can do after declining your request to increase the number of students I am teaching.
0,"As I am right now, I am incapable of teaching your soldiers.”"
0,"Eydis hopped in the truck with Agent Botteger, Colonel Richards, Officer Hellings, and one of the military personnel."
0,Sean stayed with the remaining police and military to observe his friends’ magic practice.
1,"At the far side of the range, they set up various targets from the glass pane to three vests similar to the one she was wearing but more armored with a tan pattern."
0,There was even a tall black shield with what looked like a thin window near the top.
0,A selection of odd weapons was laid out on a table beside the truck.
0,They were similar in form to the small hand-held weapon that major Wickenny showed her in the last lesson and that was fired at her.
0,"“From what I hear, you can use three types of magic?” Colonel Richards asked."
0,"“Yes, but life magic cannot be demonstrated on targets like these."
0,I would need a live target you would not mind killing in order to demonstrate it for you.
0,"If you have a prisoner or criminal you can bring, multiple would be best, then I can demonstrate it at that time.”"
0,Agent Botteger and Colonel Richards looked at each other unsure of how to respond.
0,Did I say something odd?
0,Agent Botteger rubbed his eyebrows with his thumb and forefinger.
0,"“I’m sorry, but in this country, such forms of execution are not allowed.”"
0,Eydis thought the military at least would relish the opportunity.
0,Perhaps they were not at war and had no war prisoners or criminals to execute.
0,“Then we must settle with wind and spatial magic.”
0,The military set up the vests first.
0,Eydis channeled wind into her hand and swiped her arm through the air at each vest.
0,A thin blade shot out and impacted the vests.
0,"The fabric tore, but it did not cut through."
0,"Eydis increased the power, but the attack still did not break them."
0,"For her last attack, she created a spear and added a little more force to the propulsion to make up for its small size."
0,The spear penetrated the first vest easily.
0,The second was penetrated as well but not deep.
0,The spear lost all its power and dispersed.
0,"On the last, the impact was even weaker than the blade even though Eydis was sure it would pierce it as well."
0,The spear did nothing to it but damage the fabric.
0,“What is that middle vest?”
0,"“That is our standard IOTV,” Colonel Richards replied."
0,“IOTV?
0,What about the last?
0,It’s stronger than metal.”
0,“It’s a rejected concept called Dragon Skin.
0,It couldn’t stand up to combat tests despite its outward strength.
0,I still had one on hand at Fort Samper and decided on whim to bring it.”
0,They have dragons in this world too?
0,"“That is surprising,” Eydis said."
0,“Indeed.
0,We may need to consider further development for use against magic.”
0,Eydis was frustrated that she could not break it.
0,"If it was dragon scales, it would be resistant to elemental magic, so she changed to spatial."
0,"With a quick swipe of her hand, a thin planar projectile flew at the armor and split all three simultaneously."
0,"Against Jethro’s magic, the armor might as well have not been there."
0,The police and military stared at the split vests in astonishment.
0,“Did you see what hit it?”
0,"“No, you?” "
0,“Not at all.” 
0,“Did anyone?”
0,They all shook their heads.
0,Eydis continued testing both wind and spatial magic on the other targets.
0,"The glass cracked with the wind blade, and the spear penetrated it but lost all its power, like the IOTV."
0,The shield withstood both types of wind attacks.
0,"However, the spatial magic cut through both as easily as it had the armor."
0,The faces of the police and military personnel were grim.
0,Colonel Richard approached Eydis.
0,“What magic did you use just then?”
0,"“That was spatial magic,” she replied."
0,“Can anyone able to use spatial magic do this?”
0,"“Spatial magic is rare, and only one other person I know can use spatial magic this strong, and that is the man searching for me."
0,"I doubt he will show himself, but if he does, I do not believe anyone can fight him.”"
0,“Even you?
0,You defeated all those men who attacked you from what I heard.”
0,Eydis recalled the one time she tried to attack Jethro.
0,He did not even use this attack.
0,"She was not sure what he did, but she was blown back through a wall terribly injured and unable to move."
0,“I would not be hiding from him if I could kill him.
0,I do not believe anyone could rival him.
0,"Your only choice would be to flee, but even that might not be possible because he can teleport as I can.”"
0,"Eydis’s words were a terrible revelation, but Colonel Richards nodded in understanding, as grim as his expression may have been."
0,"“Do you have a description of the man,” Agent Botteger asked."
0,"When asked during her questioning at the police station whether she could describe her captors, she never even thought of giving them Jethro’s description."
0,"She did not know if he would become involved personally, but Jethro was the single person the city needed to be wary of most."
0,"If his face was sent out to the public, then they would know if he ever showed."
0,“He is shorter than me and of a thin body.” Eydis held her hand at the level of her nose to show them his height.
0,“He is middle-aged but has black hair with no grey and is trimmed short but always looks unkempt.
0,His eyes are a strong green.
0,"His voice is not that deep, but it is also not that high."
0,"He always appears unfocused, but he had enough skill to conquer my city in a single day.”"
0,“Anything specific about his face?” 
0,“It is also thin.
0,His nose is short.
0,His eyebrows are thin but straight.
0,His lips are thin too.
0,"Altogether, he is not very masculine and does not appear strong, but that deception might be one of his strengths.”"
0,"“Thank you for that important piece of information,” Major Wickenny said."
0,We will make sure this description is sent out.
0,"If you have time later, we could have you help create a facial composite at the station.”"
0,“What is that?” 
0,"“It is like a drawing of someone’s face, but we will do it on a computer with your input to make it as accurate as possible.”"
0,“I can help after we are finished with today’s lesson.” 
0,Eydis arranged with Officer Hellings to remain at the station after the lessons.
0,The Army moved on to testing their weaponry.
0,"Eydis already experienced the small handheld weapon of the police, but the others were much larger."
0,“How should I test these?”
0,“I heard you could create barriers.
0,"We would like to test these weapons to see if they are effective,” Colonel Richards explained."
0,“Can you create a barrier away from you?”
0,"“That is not difficult, but the last time I was attack with such a weapon, it bounced off and almost hit the man who attacked me.” Officer Hellings offered a suggestion."
0,“Can you angle it so that the ricochet hits the ground?
0,"The penetrating force will be weaker, but it will drastically reduce the danger."
0,Can you regulate the strength of your barrier?”
0,“Of course.”
0,"“Then angle the barrier forty-five degrees, and decrease the strength by… I think about thirty percent."
0,That should make the penetrating force about the same as if it hit directly.”
0,Forty-five degrees?
0,Thirty percent?
0,"Seeing Eydis’s confusion, Officer Hellings removed a notepad and pen from her pocket and drew out a simple diagram."
0,Eydis understood with a little more explanation.
0,“Can you do this?” she asked again.
0,“Easily.”
0,Everyone donned ear protection.
0,Eydis set her barrier across the range as far as she was able on the opposite side of where the others still practiced.
0,One of the military personnel fired the smallest of the weapons no larger than what the police carried.
0,"Its make was different, so Eydis guessed there was some difference between the two."
0,"This was an Army weapon, not a city guard weapon, or so she assumed."
0,"It might have been more powerful, but as Eydis expected, the projectile bounced off her barrier and embedded itself directly below into the dirt."
0,She did not feel much recoil.
0,The weapons gradually increased in size and power.
0,Eydis had to create new barriers as the former waned from abuse.
0,She found these bizarre weapons fascinating.
0,"Unlike bows that required exceptional skill to perfect the archery, these far more powerful firearms appeared usable by anyone."
0,The projectiles flew straight and fast.
0,An amateur only needed to point it at a target to hit it.
0,"The next weapon broke the barrier on the first shot, but the bullet still ricocheted into the ground."
0,The following weapon did the same.
0,The final was so long that the man firing had to lie down.
0,Just watching the man ready his aim made Eydis anxious.
0,The projectile demolished the barrier and continued onward.
0,The penetrating power was so forceful the ven recoil not only numbed Eydis’s arms but also her shoulders and back.
0,Eydis walked over to the man who shot the last weapon while rubbing her arms.
0,“What was that?”
0,"He did not hear her, so he removed his ear protection, and Eydis repeated her question."
0,“That last round was a black tip fifty-cal.
0,Armor penetration.
0,Looks like a seven-six-two or above is effective.”
0,“Let me try that fifty…cal?
0,That last one again.” Eydis donned her ear protection and created another barrier.
0,This was about pride.
0,She increased the barrier as strong as she could.
0,The draw on her ven was drastic enough to be felt physically.
0,Eydis nodded to say she was ready.
0,The man took aim and fired.
0,"The impact caused Eydis’s whole body to lock up from the recoil, almost dropping her, but the barrier held solid."
0,"She immediately dispersed the barrier and hobbled over, her joints popping when they first moved."
0,“That was the strongest barrier I could make.”
0,"“I’m surprised it held,” the soldier who attacked the barrier replied."
0,He clearly had confidence in his weaponry and was disappointed that it was ineffective.
0,"“Can we assume that no one else could create a barrier like that,” Colonel Richards asked."
0,“Using a barrier that strong would be foolish in a fight unless you knew an attack that powerful was coming.
0,It used far too much ven.”
0,Nothing remained to test.
0,They gathered up their weapons and broken targets into the truck.
1,"On their way back to the other side of the field, Colonel Richards discussed the possibility of taking Eydis to a location they could test explosives against her barriers."
0,He also considered having Chloe join to test her power against their protective gear since she was the only one of Eydis’s students whose power was combat ready.
0,Justin and the others had exhausted themselves from practice and were idly chatting when Eydis returned.
0,“How did it go?” she asked the group.
0,"“As usual, nothing on my end,” Justin sighed."
0,"“I tried a bunch of things, but I don’t think I can do much until I can generate more water,” Sammy said, feigning disappointment, “so I’ve been practicing that."
0,Chloe made a good target.” Sammy giggled at Chloe who was drenched.
0,Steam rose from her body as her residual heat dried her.
0,"“I still can’t control it that well,” Chloe confessed."
0,"“Once I heat up too much, my fire would not go down."
0,I needed Sammy to put me out over and over again.”
0,Miriam tossed a rock to Eydis.
0,"It was almost spherical in shape and a slightly different tone than her usual stones, more grey than tan."
0,"“Try breaking that one,” she challenged."
0,Eydis gripped it.
0,"She found her arms tired from the ven recoil, but the stone still crumbled in her hand."
0,"It was not reduced to powder, so this was certainly an improvement."
0,“Still not good enough.”
0,“You are really strong.
0,I tried to break it but couldn’t even crack it.”
0,"“I am using more than arm strength to break it,” Eydis lied to hide her Lurr strength."
0,“I do not expect you all to make major progress immediately.
0,Keep trying and you will succeed.”
0,“Can I make a request?” Miriam asked.
0,“Request?”
0,"“Next lesson, if you are testing firearms again, can I join?"
0,I saw one I haven’t fired before.
0,I really want to.” A light glistened in Miriam’s eyes.
0,"To Eydis, Miriam never appeared a weapons enthusiast."
0,"Was she not a witch, one of this world’s ancient magic users?"
0,"“I am fine with it, but you need Colonel Richards’ permission.”"
0,“Sweet!
0,Are we done then?”
0,"“Colonel Richards wants to teach you all combat safety, so he will speak to you before we leave."
0,He will do the same after every lesson from here on.”
0,Eydis invited Colonel Richards over.
0,The police and military personnel joined as well as Sean who sat down next to Miriam.
1,"Once the hour-long lecture finished, the lesson came to an end, and everyone returned to the police station."
0,"Justin grabbed Eydis’s hand and pulled her over to the other truck where Chloe, Sean, and Miriam were standing."
0,Sammy followed close behind.
0,"“We talked about it while you were still with the Colonel, but we were wondering if you wanted to hit the diner on the way back."
0,My treat.”
0,Eydis immediately recalled that was where Justin bought the cake.
0,“Yes!
0,I would love to!
0,"But, I promised to help the police with something first."
0,I do not know how long it will take.”
0,And I still have to help Rynn with the princess… 
0,“Then how about tomorrow evening?
0,We want to thank you for today.”
0,A wide smile grew on Eydis’s face.
0,Her heart quickened with excitement.
0,“Tomorrow then!” 
0,Sammy and Chloe clapped hands together and Miriam gave Eydis a thumbs-up.
0,Sean also looked pleased and said he would join them.
0,Justin lingered behind after the goodbyes and the others headed towards their cars.
0,"“Seriously, thank you for today."
0,"I know you did not want to do the lesson before, but this is really going to help everyone.”"
0,"Eydis smiled and shook her head, almost bashful."
0,“No.
0,I did it this time because I wanted to.
0,You are the one who taught me what is important and to be true to who I am.”
0,"“You give me too much credit, but thanks."
0,Do you want me to stay until you finish?”
0,“No. I will be fine.
0,I can teleport back to the apartment when I am done.”
0,“Okay.” 
0,Justin motioned Eydis to lean down.
0,"When her face was level with his, he rested his fingers under her chin and placed his lips against hers."
0,"Eydis did not recoil but almost returned the kiss, much to her surprise."
0,“I’ll see you at home.” 
0,Justin jogged off to catch up to the group.
0,Sammy grinned mischievously.
0,“What was that?
0,Justin!
0,Spill it!
0,When did this happen?!”
0,"Sammy’s interrogation continued as the group walked away, but Justin never replied."
0,Eydis could only chuckle to herself.
0,"Miriam and Chloe were not Justin’s women as she had supposed, but Sammy certainly was."
0,"Sammy would demand answers, but Eydis didn’t worry."
0,"They were friends, and so she did not doubt that Sammy would be willing to share Justin."
0,Share Justin?
0,"Without even noticing, Eydis’s apprehensions about accepting Justin as her lover had vanished."
0,How could that have happened?
0,This realization scared her.
0,"He was a human, same as Jethro and his men, but the more her thoughts lingered on him, the greater the warmth in her chest grew."
0,"Justin accepted her, and while he was still oblivious to the fact that she was not the princess, he still cared for her and never minded the differences."
0,Eydis touched the lingering feeling on her lips and found them fixed into a smile.
0,"Instead of feeling like Justin was her key to acceptance and a life with the humans of this world, she now felt she could be honest with her feelings, that she was actually excited about being with Justin, the first man who had shown her true kindness."
0,Her feet felt light as she pranced over to the station.
1,"* * *
The facial composite took longer than Eydis anticipated."
0,"Multiple faces were provided on a computer screen according to Eydis’s description, and those faces could be combined and modified as needed to mimic Jethro’s actual face."
0,"A female officer trained in making these composites worked the machine for Eydis, but even then, Eydis had trouble knowing exactly what type of information she needed to give, especially when all the faces initially looked nothing like Jethro."
0,Eventually Eydis was satisfied with the appearance.
0,"The specialist thanked her, and Eydis headed out of the station."
0,Major Wickenny waved her down by the exit.
0,“I know that your relationship with the police has not been the best.
0,"We cannot fully comprehend your situation or what you have been through, and we have only added to your troubles."
0,I just want to say personally and on behalf of all of us that we are extremely grateful for all the help you have provided so far.”
0,"Eydis stared at Major Wickenny, unable to find the words to respond to his honest, truthful gratitude."
0,"She was sure that they still thought of her as a threat and would prefer she leave the city, but now he was thanking her."
0,"If she had not rebelled against Jethro, none of the police or civilians at the hospital would have died."
0,She was the one prolonging this war.
0,"“If there is anything you need from us, please feel free to ask."
0,"As for your compensation for the information on the terrorist and magic, we can pay you or provide other forms of repayment if desired.”"
0,“I… I have no use for money.
0,"So long as Justin and Sammy and everyone are safe, that is all I care about."
0,So…”
0,First Justin and now the police?
0,Have I done anything worthy of gratitude?
0,The smile returned to Eydis’s face.
0,It came with a peaceful warmth in her chest that was not unlike what she felt when she thought of Justin after their kiss outside the station.
0,"This new feeling confused her, and she could not find an emotion to describe it."
0,It felt good.
0,"“Your thanks are payment enough,” she said."
0,"“If you ever change your mind, please tell us."
0,I look forward to next week’s lesson.”
0,Eydis left the police department in high spirits.
0,She walked around to the side of the station and stood behind a pillar where no one would see her.
0,The smile on her face never faded.
0,“I actually did well today.”
0,"Justin and Sammy, even Major Wickenny, they all looked so happy."
0,Eydis placed her hand on her chest as if to feel the pulsating warmth that radiated within and lightly stamped her feet in excitement.
0,It felt really good.
1,"After confirming that no one was near, she transmitted back to the cellar of Rynn’s house."
0,Rynn was kneeling beside the princess to wipe off the fever sweat.
0,"Multiple blankets had been brought from the bedroom and set aside, and some form of mat was placed beneath the princess to insulate her from the cold floor."
0,Rynn finished wiping the sweat and acknowledged Eydis before heading upstairs with the sweat-soiled towel.
0,The princess lay bare before Eydis.
0,The large bruises on the princess’s stomach and face that still had not faded were glaring evidence of Eydis’s anger-filled abuse.
0,The princess’s sunken face.
0,Her deathly pallor.
0,The scars on her neck and shoulder.
0,The many injuries.
0,The chains.
0,"For the first time, Eydis saw the princess not with contempt and loathing, but with pity."
0,Eydis’s breath grew short.
0,The warmth in her chest became a cold knife that cut a deep wound which threatened to suck her heart inward.
0,She sat on the floor and placed her hand over her chest to hold the wound together.
0,Once more she looked upon the princess.
0,Once more the form she saw was one of misery and sadness and deserving of help and compassion.
0,Eydis vigorously shook her head.
0,She does not deserve pity!
0,She created me as a tool to sacrifice in her place!
0,The pangs of the wound in her chest answered.
0,"But she gave you life, and without her, you would not be."
0,She abandoned her people.
0,"She was living happily while everyone suffered, especially Rynn!"
0,But she was sent here against her will before the fall of the empire.
0,She had no way to know and no way to return.
0,She hurt Rynn!
0,Rynn could have died when she attacked me!
0,But you were her target.
0,"You attacked her first, captured her, and threatened to harm Justin."
0,She never accepted Justin.
0,"He is willing to do anything, give anything, just to make her happy."
0,"But she is a royal, purebred High Elf and princess of the Amelian Empire which is at war with the humans."
0,What if she wanted to accept his love but knew she could not?
0,Eydis leaned forward until her forehead rested on the cold cement floor.
0,"Her hands balled into fists, and she slammed them down."
0,The cement fractured out like a spider’s web.
0,No!
0,She does not deserve pity!
0,I HATE HER!
0,"The wound in Eydis’s heart sucked in her anger, and for a moment her mind had clarity."
0,She raised her head to look at the pitiful frame that was barely breathing and even now was fighting a losing battle to live.
0,"Eydis blinked once, then twice."
0,“Why do I hate her?”
0,"The wound in her heart festered and oozed out fear, fear of what she had done, fear of what she was."
0,Jethro’s painful lesson rang louder in Eydis’s mind than it had ever before.
0,Doppelgangers were a unique form of Lurr created from feeding solely on one individual.
0,"While looking identical to and exhibiting heightened traits of the original, they also held natural animosity towards them."
0,"If given the chance, a doppelganger will kill and replace the original."
0,Eydis’s body shook.
0,Her eyes grew wide and trembled.
0,Why did I not see it before?
0,“I am no different than that Alukah.
0,I am no different than that giant.
0,I am a monster.”
0,“You are not a monster!” 
0,Eydis’s eyes fell upon the base of the staircase.
0,Rynn stood there holding a pitcher of water.
0,"For the first time, Eydis saw anger in Rynn’s eyes, but where she should have been surprise, the festering wound in Eydis’s heart ruptured and bled out the anger it had sucked in, anger now directed selfward."
0,“I am a monster!
0,Everything Jethro said about me is true!
0,"I thought I was fighting him, but I am doing everything he said I would!"
0,Everything he said a doppelganger would…” 
0,Eydis gritted her teeth hard enough for one of her back molars to crack.
0,“I AM a monster!”
0,A loud slap echoed in the small room.
0,"Eydis’s eyes grew wide, and she felt a light sting on her cheek."
0,"Rynn’s open palm was extended, and tears ran down from her anger-filled eyes."
0,“Stop.
0,"If you keep calling yourself a monster, you will become one.”"
0,"“But, I only hate Eydis… I only did all this to her because I am a doppelganger.” "
0,Rynn knelt in front of Eydis.
0,Her bleeding horns and large scar set between an anger-filled stare gave Rynn an overpowering presence.
0,"Eydis’s anger dried up leaving shame, and she could no longer look into Rynn’s eyes."
0,Her voice only came out in a whisper.
0,“We had the chance to run when we came to this world.
0,I could have taken you away from all this.
0,"But because I am a doppelganger, I decided to stay and capture Eydis."
0,"I wanted to become Eydis, and you got hurt because of that.”"
0,Rynn shook her head.
0,"“I got hurt because I chose to save you, not because you wanted to capture the princess."
0,It was my choice.”
0,"“But, Eydis is only in this world because she has no way to return."
0,Jethro killed her family.
0,"I knew that, but I still captured her, took her friends, took the man she loves.” "
0,A horrifying idea crept into Eydis’s mind.
0,"“What if, what if my feelings for Justin are only because I feed on her?"
0,I even stole her love and emotions.
0,I took what little she had left because I am a doppelganger.”
0,Tears welled up in Eydis’s eyes.
0,"“I would not even be if she had not created me, and now she is dying because of me.” "
0,"The welling tears fell, and Eydis clutched her aching chest."
0,“It hurts.
0,"All this time, I have caused so much pain."
0,Eydis did not deserve any of it.”
0,"Rynn’s expression softened, and she looked at Eydis like a loving parent who just finished scolding her child."
0,She grasped Eydis’s hand and placed it on Eydis’s heart.
0,“No monster would feel this pain.
0,You have proven to yourself that you are not a monster.
0,A monster would not feel remorse.” 
0,Rynn pulled Eydis into a gentle embrace and held her in silence until her tears dried.
0,"“I promised to take care of you, but you are always the one taking care of me,” Eydis spoke with a weak voice."
0,“Thank you.”
0,"Warmth returned to Eydis’s chest, but it did not replace the guilt."
0,"The wound in her heart still hurt in direct contrast to that wonderful feeling she felt before, but it no longer festered, and it no longer bled."
0,"It was healing, and Eydis knew that the healing would take time and only if she helped it heal."
0,I must right this wrong.
0,"“Rynn, we will leave this city.”"
0,Rynn pulled herself off Eydis and looked at her with endearment.
0,“When?”
0,“Justin and Sammy have been so kind to me.
0,I have lied to them all this time.
0,I am not the Eydis they love.
0,"I do not want to hurt them, so they must never know.”"
0,Rynn looked over at the dying princess.
0,“Yes.
0,We will do everything we can to save her.
0,"Once she regains consciousness, I will apologize and explain everything."
0,She can then take my place as the true Eydis once again.
0,"If she wants to tell them then, I will not stop her."
0,I cannot stop her.” 
0,Eydis’s head hung low.
0,“This is for the best.”
0,"Chapter 12
“The Methods of a Coward”
Fect"
1,“That feeling again…” 
0,Fect sat in the woods near the new portal location wearing the clothes he took from the child the day of his escape from the medical facility.
0,"Jethro tasked him with discovering how well this world’s weapons worked against magic, so wearing suitable clothing from this world helped him blend in and walk freely through the city, but he had made no progress, especially because he had to be cautious of the city guard."
0,"Each day, he returned to the forest to both hide and rest, wasting precious time he could have spent in his investigation."
0,"The more time he spent in the forest, the more he felt a strange sensation from the direction of the houses."
0,"It would only happen at certain times during the day, usually in the morning and again in the evening."
0,Some days the strange feeling occurred more frequently.
0,"Today, Fect chose to stay in the forest to investigate the sensation instead of heading into the city."
0,"The sun had yet to rise over the ridgeline, but the dim morning light filtered through the trees."
0,"If this day was like the others, the sensation would appear around the time the sun peeked over the mountains."
0,So Fect waited.
0,He cleared his mind and focused solely on what he felt.
0,The first rays of sunlight scattered through the spring-green leaves of the trees.
0,Soon…
0,“There!” 
0,"The feeling was faint, but now that Fect focused on it, he could more specifically tell the direction."
0,He placed a long branch pointing in the general direction of the sensation.
0,"However, one direction was not enough."
0,"Each time the sensation came, another shortly followed."
0,Fect ran as fast as he could through the forest for another angle.
0,"The greater the distance from the first, the more accurate of an intersection he could create."
0,"When Fect felt that he had gone far enough, he quickly cut another low branch of a tree and returned his focus to feeling the sensation."
0,This time it came quickly.
0,"If he had decided to go further, he may have been too distracted while running or breaking off a branch to feel it."
0,He laid the branch pointing in the direction of the sensation.
0,"Fect found two trees in the line projected by the branch and brought the branch to the first tree, laying it down pointing in the direction of the second."
0,"In this way, he reasoned that he could bring the two branches together to pinpoint where the lines met."
0,He ran back to the first branch and repeated the same steps.
0,"After going back and forth between the two branches jumping them forward from target to target while staying in the general line, he reached the edge of the residential district that the forest bordered."
0,About ten houses sat along the dead-end road.
0,"Due to the inaccurate way Fect found the intersection of the two directions, he was unsure the specific location of the sensation, only that the estimated intersection was near the edge of the district, not deep within."
0,His best option was to wait for it to occur again.
0,"Now that he was closer, it would be stronger."
0,The next occurrence should be in the evening.
0,Again he waited.
0,Fect chewed on a piece of bark to stave his hunger.
0,"Occasionally, a Human from one of the houses sauntered out into their yard or peered out a window, so Fect hid in the shrubs."
0,He kept his actions simple and kept his mind clear to not miss the direction.
0,"Unlike in the morning, the time the sensation came in the evening was always different."
0,He could not afford to miss it.
0,"He was running out of time to complete Jethro’s mission, and if he came up empty after wasting time on this sensation, Jethro would surely punish him."
0,"The sun set, and the only light that penetrated the forest came from the windows of the houses."
0,The sensation had yet to reappear.
0,"The randomness of the evening occurrence meant that there was always the chance it would not happen, but it always happened in the morning without fail, so there was little worry in Fect’s mind."
0,"After waiting late into the night, Fect was about to turn back."
0,Sleeping so close to civilization would be dangerous.
0,"He started walking away, but then he felt it."
0,“Strong!”
0,The sensation was not unlike standing in the same room as Jethro as he cast his teleportation magic or during his futile attempt to observe the doppelganger’s actions when she teleported away each day she searched for the princess.
0,It did not come from the houses closest to him but more in the far corner of the district.
0,He was further from the actual location than he had anticipated.
0,Fect moved as quietly as possible but could not risk missing the second occurrence.
0,He stopped near the backyards of three houses at the end of an adjacent street to his initial estimate.
0,"Fect waited, but this time with anticipation gripping his chest."
0,His heart thundered.
0,It came again from the house to his right.
0,The overgrown shrubbery had overtaken the fence that bordered it.
0,It stood alone in the corner of the residential district more separated from the houses beside it than any other neighboring houses were from each other.
0,"Fect found his target, and he could hardly contain his excitement."
0,"Having felt it close for the second time, he confirmed that the sensation originated from spatial magic and specifically teleportation magic."
0,There were only two people in this world Fect knew who could possibly use teleportation magic: the elven princess and her doppelganger.
0,"For now, Fect was tired and hungry."
0,Attempting to investigate the house in this condition would be foolish.
0,He returned to his stash of rations deeper in the forest and slept uneasily from excitement.
0,"If he could not complete his mission, discovering the location of the princess was a far greater achievement."
0,"Even if it was the doppelganger, that should be adequate consolation for failing his original mission."
0,He had to complete everything the next day before Jethro reopened the portal.
1,"* * *
The longest period between uses of teleportation magic was between morning and evening."
0,"There were two possibilities: first, the user was always at the house both night and day except for the moments in the morning and evening where they briefly teleported away, or second, the user was always gone and only came to the house for those two brief moments during the day."
0,"Fect hoped it was the latter, but in case it was the former, he needed to use as much caution as was possible."
0,Fect investigated the shrubs on the forest side of the fence for a break or opening.
0,The overgrown plants suggested a high probability of disrepair.
0,Finding two neighboring rotten planks took little time.
0,He pulled them from their nails at the base and slid them away from each other to create enough room to slip through.
0,"This was another time Fect was thankful for his small stature, even compared to other minums."
0,The shrubs were far more overgrown on the inside of the fence than on the outside.
0,"Maneuvering through them proved difficult, especially because Fect was trying his utmost to keep the plants from shaking and giving away his position."
0,Eventually he found a low opening beneath the shrubs that he could crawl through.
0,Fect slid on his stomach until he could see out into the yard.
0,The grass was untrimmed and half his height with many long stalks that would tower above him.
0,"Even if invisible, walking through would leave a trail, and the grass might wilt from the heat of his invisibility magic."
0,Fect crawled on his stomach under the shrubs along the grass-line.
0,The grass stood tall enough to conceal him and the light shaking of the lower branches.
0,He worked his way around the edge of the yard to the house and snuck along the siding to the back door.
0,Now he needed his invisibility.
0,Fect coated himself with heat and distorted the light around him.
0,He propped his arms and legs against the doorframe and spidered up until he could peer into the window.
0,"The curtain was closed, but there was enough of a gap for him to see a little inside."
0,Bread?
0,He almost let slip the word spoken in his confused mind.
0,Many stacks of dried flatbread sat atop the kitchen table.
0,"There was far more bread than what any one person could eat, but upon closer inspection, the bases of some of the stacks had been nibbled on, likely by some rodent or other pest."
0,"The kitchen looked used, and some of the cupboards were open, so the bread had probably been ignored and not eaten or at least eaten very slowly."
0,"There was a lot of bread, and Fect continually found himself drawn to the absurdity of the stacks as he peered in."
0,Fect saw no resident in the house.
0,The second possibility seemed likely.
0,The user of the teleportation magic might not be here.
0,The doorknob was unlocked.
0,"He slowly opened the door, but it caught on a small chain latch."
0,"Cutting through it with fire magic was trivial, but in case he had to leave, Fect could not risk leaving behind evidence."
0,He worked his small hand through the thin opening between the door and doorframe and pulled the chain hook from its latch.
1,Fect inspected the kitchen and living room with his invisibility magic still active.
0,"The kitchen was clean of dust, but the living room had a layer of grey dust on everything, even the upholstery."
0,The front doorknob also had dust.
0,The resident never opened the door.
0,"Obviously, they teleport in and out, but it’s strange… Didn’t the princess live with some young human man in this world somewhere along the river?"
0,I am sure I heard the doppelganger and Austin talking about that.
0,And this does not look like the home of some young man.
0,Fect inspected the portraits on the wall.
0,Many depicted elderly persons.
0,Some were clearly the same person at different ages of their long life.
0,Whether that person was still the current resident or not was uncertain.
0,What if the princess removed the former resident and secured this location as an additional hiding spot?
0,That assumption felt wrong.
0,"From how the elves in the palace spoke of the princess, she would not be the type to do such things."
0,The princess would not take a home from someone.
0,"If she was sharing it with the owner, that would be more understandable, but no man or woman of the age shown in the paintings would be away from home; they couldn’t, at least for any long stretch of time."
0,"If that was so, then where was the elderly resident?"
0,There was only one teleportation user who would not feel bad killing someone or stealing a house to use as a base.
0,"There was a monster in this world, the doppelganger."
0,Fect could not make any hasty conclusions.
0,There were still rooms he had not searched.
0,"The elderly resident could be bedridden, and the princess was taking care of him or her."
0,The man she lived with somewhere along the river could be the grandchild of the resident.
0,"Fect tried to convince himself, but the thought that this house might actually be a Lurr’s den made him anxious."
0,Fect turned back down the entryway to the hall.
0,A young Forest Elf stood before him.
0,"The girl’s face bore a long scar, possible signs of abuse."
0,Lines of dried blood fell from the tips of her horns into a stained rag tied around her forehead.
0,"The doppelganger had a spriggan with her, Rynn."
0,This was the doppelganger’s den!
0,The young elf froze in place.
0,"Fect’s invisibility magic remained active, but because he was moving when he entered the hallway, there would have been a slight blur for a moment."
0,"If Rynn was close enough, she might be able to feel the heat radiating from his magic."
0,Fect did not move or breathe.
0,Rynn did not move or breathe.
0,Her eyes searched the hallway and kitchen.
0,"Slowly she took a step back, then another."
0,She moved backwards until her back bumped into the open door of what appeared to be a closet full of boxes and clothes.
0,"Without removing her eyes from the hallway, Rynn retreated step by step until the door closed and her back pressed against it."
0,There was fear in her eyes.
0,Fect pondered his options during their invisible standoff.
0,Killing Rynn right here would be easy.
0,He could then explore the house uninhibited.
0,"Or, he could capture her and use her as a hostage against the doppelganger to get information on the princess’s location."
0,She was awfully protective of her pet spriggan.
0,That’s the better option.
0,"Fect stepped forward, and immediately Rynn’s eyes were on him."
0,"She thrust her palm forward, and a small sphere of water shot towards his face."
0,"He dodged to the left, but a second was ready and hit him in the chest."
0,"Fect feared that it might have been offensive magic, but it was plain water."
0,It was not corrosive or acidic nor did it carry any force.
0,"It only served to break through his invisibility at the point of impact, but the light quickly bent around him once more."
0,"Fect was now discovered, so he no longer needed invisibility."
0,He dropped his magic and smiled.
0,Fear evolved into terror in the spriggan’s expression.
0,“You must be that monster’s pet.
0,Where did she go?”
0,Rynn did not answer.
0,Her trembling eyes glanced quickly towards the doorway to Fect’s left and then the doorway to his right.
0,Both were open.
0,She was searching for a way out.
0,“No answer?
0,"Well then, how about the location of the Amelian Princess?"
0,Do you know where she is?”
0,Rynn remained silent.
0,"“Loyal, aren’t you?"
0,Or are you more afraid of that monster than you are of me?”
0,Her expression changed slightly.
0,"While she still trembled in fear, her lips formed a light scowl."
0,"“Either way, I need you to come with me.”"
0,"Fect took a step forward, and Rynn reached her hand for the doorknob without taking her eyes off Fect."
0,“That is nothing but a storeroom.
0,You can’t escape there.” Fect produced a small flame in his hand.
0,“And locking yourself inside will not help you.
0,Make this easy on both of us.
0,"If you come with me, I promise not to hurt you."
0,That may be a better deal than what you get with that monster.”
0,A cold mist rose from both Rynn’s hands.
0,"While keeping one hand on the doorknob, she thrust the other at Fect’s feet."
0,He jumped to avoid the ray of frost.
0,A thin sheet of ice coated the floor.
0,"When Fect landed, he lost his footing for but a moment until his feet froze to it."
0,Rynn used this opening to dive towards the open door to Fect’s right.
0,He flash-heated the floor to remove the ice and pursued the girl.
0,She jumped onto the bed and braced her head with her arms.
0,"With a strong kick off the other side, the spriggan broke through the window."
0,“Accursed agile sprigs!”
1,Fect climbed onto the bed and dove out the window after her.
0,"Due to his small stature, he easily avoided the broken glass on the edges."
0,He rolled to a stop on the front lawn and looked around.
0,The rag that was wrapped around her forehead sat on the grass in front of him.
0,Rynn ran down the road with a limp in her left leg.
0,"Her left foot was bleeding as was her right arm near the shoulder, but neither appeared too serious."
0,They only impeded her flight.
0,Fect was grateful.
0,He had no hope catching a fleeing spriggan otherwise.
0,The road was almost barren of people.
0,One dark-skinned man in a fluffy yellow robe stood in his yard holding what looked like a rolled-up paper in a transparent bag.
0,He saw the bleeding girl with horns and froze.
0,He could use this.
0,Fect focused his gaze at the man’s feet.
0,A pillar of fire engulfed him.
0,Only a charred silhouette remained.
0,Rynn saw this and yelped.
0,"Her pace increased, almost tripping over her injured leg."
0,"A woman ran out of the house, her eyes frozen to the remains of the man who was likely her husband."
0,"Her body trembled, and she fell to her knees unable to comprehend what she saw."
0,"“Oh, Lord Jesus…”"
0,"Fect yelled at the woman in the highest, childlike voice he could, pointing at the fleeing Elf."
0,“That!
0,That!”
0,"Hearing Fect’s shout, Rynn glanced behind her."
0,The woman saw the scarred face and bloody horns.
0,“Demon!” She screamed and fled back inside her house in a fit of panic.
0,"This early in the morning, the number of people outside their homes were few, but anyone Rynn looked at, Fect disposed of in like manner."
1,The body count grew to five when Fect chased Rynn out of the residential district.
0,The main road was far busier.
0,Many of the metal carriages swerved or stopped upon seeing Rynn.
0,She ran across an intersecting road and was nearly hit by a carriage that tipped onto two tires as it swerved to avoid her.
0,It spun to a stop leaving black streaks on the road.
0,"When she looked back at the large, unknown object that nearly struck her, Fect lit an intense fire beneath it."
0,"To his surprise, the vehicle exploded in a fireball that rivaled powerful fire magic."
0,Pandemonium ensued.
0,Screams erupted from those on the streets when they saw the explosion and the girl with horns.
0,Fect ignited a second carriage which also exploded like the last.
0,It was not happenstance.
0,The carriages were combustible.
0,People fled in every direction in a raving panic.
0,Those in carriages abandoned them and fled on foot.
0,"Rynn spun, not knowing where to flee."
0,"Fect lit anyone along her line of sight on fire, being too far to accurately conjure pillars of flame at their feet."
0,"She ran, avoiding the street, and weaved between buildings so no one would see her."
0,Fect cursed under his winded breath.
0,She caught on to his ploy.
0,No matter.
0,The devastation should be sufficient by now.
1,He followed close to not lose her and to make her aware that he was still pursuing.
0,His plan would be ruined if he lost her or she decided to hide out of sight.
0,The loud sirens of the city guards echoed in the distance.
0,Fect chased Rynn into a light commerce district with shops lining the streets.
0,"She fled along the back alleys of the buildings where few people would see her, but every so often someone noticed her and met the same fiery demise."
0,The sirens grew closer.
0,Now was the time.
0,Fect lit a wall of fire with his gaze in front of the spriggan to impede her flight.
0,"She turned back, but Fect cut in front of her."
0,"“I think this is enough running,” Fect sneered, or as close to a sneer as he could manage while breathing heavily."
0,A thin alley stretched to Fect’s right and led to the road.
0,"He slowly approached Rynn, and she slowly limped backwards."
0,"As Fect rotated to the right, so did she."
0,"When her back was facing the alley, Fect moved forward, and Rynn backpedaled into the alley."
0,"“I need you to put on a show for me, but some might pity a girl in a pretty dress.”"
0,Fect focused on various locations on the flower-print dress.
0,"Fire sprouted, and Rynn fought to pat out the flames, but the number grew faster than she could extinguish them."
0,"She drenched her dress in desperation, but the water only boiled under Fect’s gaze, scalding her skin."
0,She pulled the dress off from over her head and tossed it away.
0,Only a loose silken undergarment hung from her shoulders.
0,It extended past her waist and stopped halfway down her thighs.
0,Her long tail twitched irritably behind her digitigrade legs.
0,"Bloody horns, pointed ears, scarred face, long tail, and inhuman legs."
0,"“Now, dance for me.”"
0,Fect lit a fire in front of Rynn.
0,"When she jumped back to avoid it, Fect extinguished it with a wave of his hand and lit another."
0,He pushed her further and further through the alley until he forced her out onto the walkway lining the road.
1,Confusion spread among those who saw her and the flames.
0,Fect remained at the edge of the alley.
0,"This street was far busier than the previous, like the morning of a market when merchants were prepping to open shop."
0,"The number of people was few, but the passing carriages were many."
0,Rynn searched around frantically trying to find where she should run.
0,One brave woman worked up the courage to approach her.
0,“Are you okay?”
0,Rynn shouted at the woman in terror.
0,“Get away from me!
0,Run!”
0,The woman could not understand Rynn’s desperate warning.
0,She spoke in Elven and did not seem to know any English.
0,The foolish doppelganger never taught her.
0,The woman reached out a caring hand towards the quivering spriggan.
0,Fect set the woman on fire by heating her directly like he had Rynn’s clothes.
0,He already showed his pillar of fire to the city guards.
0,It was his signature.
0,This time needed to be different.
0,The woman screamed and flailed as the fire quickly rose in intensity.
0,"Rynn conjured water, then ice, but both evaporated, powerless against Fect’s superior flame in his unbroken gaze on the woman."
0,She could only stare in horror as the woman crumbled to the ground.
0,Her eyes met Fect’s a short distance away.
0,"“Put on a show,” Fect mouthed back in Elven."
0,Rynn ran across the street.
0,Fect ignited an intense fire beneath a carriage in front of her.
0,The force of the explosion blew her to her back on the road.
0,The traffic stopped.
0,The drivers of the carriages all ran.
0,No one remained.
0,"She looked around to find a direction she could run, but the road was soon cut off."
0,The flashing blue and red flares of the city guards arrived.
0,Fect used Rynn’s moment of confusion to quickly climb up a pipe on the side of the building onto a small ledge on the second floor.
0,He lay down to get a clear aerial view of the road.
0,"Amid the loud sirens, thunderous flapping could also be heard."
0,The flying carriage arrived.
0,Fect enshrouded himself with his invisibility magic while Rynn looked up at him in terror.
0,He could not risk the flying enemy spotting him.
0,The first of the city guards swung open their doors and crouched behind them.
0,"They aimed the small handheld weapon that Fect was familiar with at the girl, but they did not immediately fire."
0,"“On the ground,” the guards shouted from behind their metal cover."
0,Cowards.
0,These small weapons were not what Fect wanted to see.
0,He already knew their effectiveness.
0,His only choice was to antagonize the guards but not enough for them to outright kill Rynn.
0,Fect ignited a carriage near the guards but not close enough that they would be injured in the explosion.
0,The guards dove behind their carriage.
0,Neither dared show their heads.
0,"Instead, they removed an object from their belt and yelled into it."
0,“Suspect on Juniper using fire magic.
0,We are pinned down.”
0,Rynn tried to use this time to escape.
0,Fect ignited an abandoned carriage in front of her to force her back into the center of the street.
0,Her arms and legs shook in fear as she searched in desperation for a way out of her cage.
0,The more she panicked--the more the guards panicked--the happier Fect became.
0,"Another city guard carriage arrived on the other side of the girl from the first, and a third arrived close behind."
0,They parked their carriages perpendicular to the road to create a barrier between themselves and the girl.
0,Perfect.
0,One of the guards held a much larger weapon that Fect had seen at the medical facility.
0,He propped it on the front of the carriage with his body safely behind.
0,"“Dance for me,” Fect whispered, not at the spriggan but at the city guard."
0,They were reacting exactly as he had hoped.
0,Fect ignited a vehicle near them.
0,All the guards hid behind their carriages once again.
0,He needed more or his luck here would go to waste.
0,"He only had one more carriage at his disposal within his range aside from the city guard, but he was not against using theirs."
0,"He only feared that if he attacked them directly, they would shoot Rynn before he could witness the steady increase of their firepower."
0,"Both sides of the street were blocked, and the only alley Rynn could use as an exit was guarded by Fect."
0,The cage was complete.
0,There was no escape.
0,"Rynn curled up on the street and covered her head, trying to show she was not a threat."
0,“Eydis!” she cried through sobs.
0,One of the city guards peeked out from behind the carriage.
0,She flagged those near her to lower their weapons.
0,“Hold!
0,I don’t think she’s an enemy.” 
0,"Rynn certainly looked terrified, and Fect did not take into consideration that her terror would sway the guards."
0,"“What is happening here,” the guard called."
0,“Do you know Eydis FeAmel?”
0,Fect could not let the aggression die.
0,How could he spin this to his favor?
0,"If fear was such strong evidence of Rynn’s innocence, he needed to turn that evidence into a greater threat to the guard."
0,An idea popped into his mind immediately.
0,What better way could there be than to make the guard think that Rynn’s fire magic was spiraling out of control?
0,The crying girl lifted her terrified gaze to the guard who called out to her and was now leaving the cover of her carriage.
0,"The moment their eyes met, Fect set the female guard on fire."
0,Those close to her pulled her back behind cover and fought to suffocate the flames with their coats.
0,"The guard was badly burned, but she would survive."
0,Many of the guards aimed their weapons at the girl out of fear of their own.
0,“It’s not me!
0,"I didn’t do it!” Tears streamed down Rynn’s face, but no one could understand her cries."
0,“He’s over there!”
0,"Rynn stood and swung her arm to point at where Fect hid, but the moment her extended hand crossed the direction of the guards in front of her, multiple gunshots thundered across the street from a single city guardsman."
0,"The girl jolted from the numerous impacts of the high-speed projectiles, and she collapsed to the ground."
0,"“Stupid girl… Now I can’t use her,” Fect grumbled."
0,He was about to retreat when a flash of light appeared near the downed spriggan.
0,The elf scanned the guards with their weapons drawn and then found the girl bleeding out on the road.
0,The princess?
0,"No, that was Jethro’s magic, so that must be the doppelganger!"
0,The doppelganger ignored the guards and dropped to Rynn’s side.
0,She removed Rynn’s undergarment and immediately stemmed the bleeding.
0,Another gunshot.
0,"The impact knocked the doppelganger’s head aside, but there was no damage."
0,The projectile was deflected by a barrier.
0,The doppelganger looked in the direction of the attack to the terrified guardsman who shot Rynn and now shot at the doppelganger.
0,Her eyes glowed with vehement crimson.
0,“Beynard!
0,Did you do this?!”
0,She stood and confronted the guards.
0,“Did you attack this child!?”
0,Fect chuckled to himself as his grin steadily grew wider.
0,The weapon was blocked easily by spatial magic.
0,"Soon, they would bring larger and more powerful weapons."
0,This is what he wanted to see.
0,Dance for me.
0,"Chapter 13
“Choices Made in Desperation”
Eydis"
1,It began as an average morning.
0,Eydis woke up before Justin as usual on the days Justin could sleep in.
0,She teleported over to check on the princess who remained in poor condition.
0,"Instead of continuing her attempts to provide the princess ven, Eydis had been using her life magic to ease fatigue and nourish the body."
0,"Through both Eydis’s and Rynn’s efforts, the high fever was breaking."
0,The ven the princess’s body was expending to preserve her life now nearly matched its recovery speed.
0,"The princess would no longer weaken, and unless there was a sudden change, she would not die, but Eydis could not tell how long the princess would take to recover enough for Eydis to apologize and confess everything, if she would recover at all."
0,"After spending a moment with Rynn, Eydis returned to Justin’s apartment to begin breakfast."
0,"She was limited in her selection of recipes, but if it was the egg and cheese dish Justin served her when she first arrived, she was more than capable."
0,She was quite proud that she could cook it better than him and even asked Rynn what spices would best elevate the flavor.
0,Her omelets became an immediate favorite for Justin.
0,“Breakfast is ready.”
0,Justin stirred but did not wake.
0,Eydis walked over and planted a light kiss on his cheek.
0,“Breakfast is ready.
0,Eat before it grows cold.”
0,She grabbed Justin’s hand and pulled him off the couch.
0,"Part of her thought it odd that Justin still insisted on sleeping on the couch instead of sharing her bed now that she was one of his women, but she also felt that she did not deserve to share a bed with him."
0,"After all, she was not the princess."
0,Eydis also felt that she was not ready for that level of intimacy yet.
0,"Eydis’s face flushed lightly, and she suppressed the thought."
0,They ate together and spent the morning uneventfully.
0,"Justin worked on his studies while Eydis sat on the couch reading another book she borrowed from Sean, a dramatized account of a female ruler from the history of this world, Cleopatra."
0,She found reading a wonderful study aid to further improve her English.
0,This was the twelfth book she read this week alone.
0,"By the next week, she will have not only finished Sean’s bookcase but also the two boxes of books he stored under his bed."
0,The rate she devoured books surprised him.
0,"Apparently, the princess only read about a book a week and had yet to finish Justin’s small collection he rarely touched."
0,"Through careful conversation, she learned which books of Justin’s the princess had already read and completed them in secret while reading Sean’s collection."
0,Sean offered to accompany her to the library to obtain a library card next week so she could keep reading.
0,"While Eydis read, a faint buzzing reached her ear, but she thought little of it."
0,It passed in time only to reappear a minute later.
0,"Again, she ignored it."
0,"Once Justin’s ringtone played on the table, Eydis closed her book, tired of the annoyances, and decided to investigate the buzzing."
0,"It was very faint, so quiet that Justin could not have heard it, and it came from down the hall."
0,It was her phone.
0,She left it in her room.
0,Eydis quickly rushed down the hall as Justin picked up his phone in the kitchen.
0,"She did not reach hers in time to catch the call, but Major Wickenny’s name displayed on the screen, missed four times."
0,"“Eydis,” Justin called in a panic from the kitchen."
0,Eydis rushed back into the kitchen to find Justin on his phone staring at the local news on the television.
0,The voice she heard over Justin’s phone belonged to Colonel Richards.
0,The news showed areal footage of a road with burning vehicles where the police were in a standoff against a small figure.
0,Eydis’s heart sank into despair.
0,She knew the small girl.
0,“Where is this?!”
0,“The southeast side of the city.
0,The old town.
0,I’m not familiar with it.”
0,“Tell Colonel Richards that girl is not an enemy!” 
1,Eydis recalled the transmission formula she thought she had forgotten long ago and teleported to the top of the tallest building in the city.
0,Small wisps of smoke rose from the southeast.
0,Eydis strung together a transmission formula and activated it.
0,"Due to the inaccuracy of the destination, she fell twenty feet to the roof of another building, but from her location, she could just see the road where the standoff was taking place."
0,"Another transmission formula emerged in her mind at a startling speed, and with a crack and flash of light, Eydis appeared on the street."
0,Rynn was bleeding out on the road.
0,She was too late.
0,Eydis tore the gown off Rynn and ran her hands over the many bullet holes to stem the bleeding.
0,Rynn had severe internal damage.
0,She could not move Rynn for fear of sudden motion killing her.
0,She could not teleport Rynn away in this condition.
0,"Using life magic, she suppressed the shock in the body and stabilized the girl to prevent her heart and other organs from failing."
0,"Before she could treat the damage, her adept ears picked up on the small tick of a firearm, a sound she recognized from her demonstrations with the police and military."
0,She erected a quick barrier but was not fast enough to strengthen it.
0,"The impact of the bullet knocked her head back and caused some pain, but the bullet was deflected."
0,"Rage burned in her, her eyes glowing red."
0,She stood and stared down the police.
0,"Although all the police had their firearms raised, only one showed open animosity, Officer Beynard."
0,“Beynard!
0,Did you do this?!” 
0,She stood.
0,“Did you attack this child!?”
0,“I knew you were a demon!” Beynard shouted.
0,“Look at her ears!” 
0,Eydis did not have time to care about the police.
0,"If she did not act fast, Rynn would die despite Eydis’s life-support magic."
0,"She focused on the worst injuries first, starting with the bullet that penetrated Rynn’s back."
0,It lodged itself in Rynn’s left lung.
0,The lung was filling fast with blood.
0,Eydis expelled the bullet with wind focused in the bullet wound and sealed the hole in the lung.
0,She then expelled the blood in the lungs using wind once again.
0,"Rynn’s breathing improved, but that alone took far too much of Eydis’s ven."
0,She was already low due to aiding the princess’s recovery.
0,Eydis’s fury grew stronger.
0,“Do not let her revive that demon or more of us will be burned like Joyce.”
0,"“The Major is ordering us to stand down,” an officer called from the far side."
0,“The girl is not an enemy.” 
0,Another officer from that same side approached cautiously with his firearm lowered but still in hand for protection.
0,"“Stay back,” Eydis growled at him, her crimson glare burning."
0,The officer frightened and fired.
0,"The shot ricocheted off Eydis’s weak barrier, hitting Rynn’s extended ankle."
0,“We cannot arrest her.
0,"She can kill us if we touch her,” Officer Beynard warned, ignoring Major Wickenny’s order."
0,“You’ve read the reports.
0,Her barrier will break with enough force.”
0,Everything she taught the police they were using against her.
0,Eydis seethed internally.
0,She only managed to stop the bleeding of the new wound.
0,Her life magic was having less and less effect.
0,Eydis could not risk continuing in her ven-starved state without the threat of her treatment accidently killing Rynn.
0,The cold shivers of ven exhaustion informed her that she could no longer teleport away.
0,She lacked the ven to use transmission to send Rynn to safety.
0,"Even if she could, she might not be able to reach the house in time to treat Rynn, and the police would follow her there."
0,Using her Lurr strength to flee somewhere else with Rynn would worsen the already fatal injuries.
0,"The police would likely attack if she tried to flee, and her ven was too low to hold a barrier against them."
0,"“If we don’t kill her now, there is no telling how many more people will die!” "
0,Officer Beynard continued inciting his fellow police.
0,The police could not be reasoned with; they were too quick to act on fear.
0,Fleeing was impossible.
0,Eydis had only one option.
0,"“You killed her,” Eydis lied, but if she did not act fast, that lie would become truth."
0,"With what dregs of ven that remained, she created a barrier around Rynn, but she doubted it would hold back a single bullet."
0,“You killed her!”
0,The anger she felt towards the police raged into an inferno.
0,Eydis dove.
0,The force of her takeoff ripped away the soles from her shoes and fired pieces of asphalt out in her wake.
0,The gap between her and Officer Beynard closed in an instant.
0,She grabbed his collar with her momentum and threw him.
0,The man flew over fifty yards before hitting pavement and bouncing into a car.
0,Eydis did not care if he lived or died.
0,"She saved his life once, so she had no qualms about taking it again."
0,"Now openly hostile, the nearby police had reason to retaliate."
0,Eydis swerved to the right to avoid a gunshot.
0,She grabbed the attacker’s arm and swung him into the other officer.
0,"His arm broke from the torque, and both police tumbled to the sidewalk unconscious."
0,"To the side, Eydis saw a badly burnt body."
0,"She knew her, Officer Hellings."
0,"Fire magic was being used, but not by Rynn."
0,This was a setup.
0,"Two barbs struck Eydis’s back, and the surge of electricity through her body constricted her muscles, but the effect only slowed her a little."
0,"She already attacked the police, so she needed to eliminate the immediate threat first."
0,Eydis grabbed the cords and tore the weapon she had not seen before from the officer’s grip.
0,She kicked him in the side and felt his ribs buckle on impact.
0,"He flew through a store window, showering glass onto the sidewalk."
0,Eydis tore out the barbs by the wires and searched for the next hostile target among the police cars on the other side of Rynn.
1,The remaining police fled.
0,"In their place two large, armored vehicles similar in color to the tan uniforms worn by the army personal weaved through the abandoned cars."
0,No fewer than ten soldiers exited.
0,They wore the IOTV that had resisted her wind magic and brandished weapons that broke her barriers in the demonstrations.
0,Eydis’s heart sank into fear.
0,“I have created my own demise.”
0,The soldiers pointed their weapons at Eydis and advanced slowly.
0,"Instead of fighting, Eydis ran back to Rynn and shielded the small girl with her body."
0,The weak barrier that she left behind had already dispersed.
0,“I surrender!
0,I will not fight you!”
0,The soldiers hurried to check the status of the downed police.
0,Only three of the soldiers approached Eydis.
0,"Two of them kept their aim on Eydis, having seen her assault on the police."
0,A third reached down and grabbed her arm.
0,“We were ordered by Colonel Richards to retrieve you and have you explained the situation.
0,Medics are on the way to treat the girl.”
0,Eydis shook off the soldier’s grasp but did not attack.
0,"A second soldier attempted to help the first in securing Eydis, but they were no match for her strength."
0,“No!” Eydis released herself and returned to cover Rynn.
0,“Please. I must save her.” 
0, The soldiers could only guard Eydis.
0,"“What is the status of the police,” one of the soldiers asked from further away."
0,"“None are dead, but many are in critical condition."
0,One officer further from here has a broken neck.
0,We cannot risk moving him until EMTs arrive.”
0,The soldiers continued talking and aiding the injured.
0,Eydis did not leave Rynn.
0,She was recovering a little ven from her contact but not enough to teleport away or heal Rynn.
0,"In Rynn’s state, Eydis did not know if the young girl could even recover ven, so the longer she remained in contact with her, the more ven Rynn lost."
0,Draining Rynn’s ven only weakened her further.
0,"Even now, Rynn could pass at any moment."
0,Eydis gritted her teeth and pressed her head harder into the asphalt as she held Rynn under her.
0,"With what little ven she recovered, she periodically checked Rynn’s weakening vitals."
0,"If Rynn dies, I will kill them all."
0,I will kill every last one of them!
0,Eydis was ready to become the monster that everyone feared she was.
0,"She came to this world for Rynn, and if Earth rejected the girl as Whinhlem had, she would end it herself."
0,"Thorough and indiscriminate, until not one human remained."
0,“Eydis!”
0,"Eydis’s heart constricted painfully in her chest, choking out a whimper."
0,She knew that voice.
0,Justin ran behind Major Wickenny.
0,The soldiers guarding Eydis made room.
0,“What happened?
0,Are you okay?” Justin placed his arm on Eydis’s trembling shoulder to lift her.
0,"His grip retracted when he saw the condition of the young, horned girl Eydis covered."
0,“The police… they hurt Rynn… She’s dying…” Eydis cried.
0,“You can’t heal her?
0,Are you out of ven?” Justin removed his jacket.
0,He lightly embraced Eydis and held their arms together.
0,"“The more contact, the better, right?”"
0,Tears of gratitude fell down Eydis’s cheeks.
0,Justin’s ven recovery was exceptional.
0,"Elf ven recovery rate should be higher than a human’s, and other humans like Sammy were as low as what Eydis expected, but for some reason Justin was different."
0,This made her all the more grateful that he came.
0,A medic arrived and reached for Rynn.
0,“Do not touch her!” Eydis swatted the medic’s hand away.
0,"She felt the bones in his hand break, and he cried out in pain, cursing at Eydis."
0,“He is trying to help.”
0,“Do not touch her.
0,Nobody touch her.”
0,Justin held Eydis tighter.
0,"If she did not trust anyone else, giving her ven was all he could do."
0,“How much longer before you can help her?”
0,Eydis shook her head.
0,"Even though her ven was recovering, contact was still the slowest method."
0,"Rynn’s injuries need a substantial amount of ven, and fast."
0,She needed to return to the house on the edge of the city.
0,One of the armored vehicles exploded.
0,"The soldiers raised their weapons, some of them pointing at Eydis."
0,“It was not us!
0,We cannot use fire magic!” Eydis cried.
0,"“It’s not Eydis,” Justin shouted."
0,“Someone else is here!”
0,“Eyes on the buildings!” 
0,"The soldiers looked around, firearms raised."
0,No one could be found.
0,Eydis lifted herself off Rynn and held her carefully in her arms.
0,“Do you have enough ven?” Justin asked.
0,“No. But I can get more now.”
0,Eydis worked out a simple teleportation formula using the ven that Justin provided.
0,"When she tore open the portal, the ground beneath the soldier beside them heated."
0,Justin kicked the soldier away and used the force to pull Eydis and Rynn through the portal before the billowing flame erupted.
1,They landed on the carpet of a small bedroom.
0,"The portal collapsed almost immediately before the flames could enter, barely giving them time to exit."
0,"It was formulated for two, not three."
0,She never imagined Justin would pull them through.
0,His timing reacting to that attack was far too perfect.
0,She felt the peculiar sensation of his time magic at work.
0,"If he did not act, they may have been caught in the fire, and that soldier would have certainly died."
0,Eydis took a few long breaths to calm down and lifted Rynn onto the bed.
0,"“Was that…” Justin began, breathing quickly in his panic."
0,"“Yes, one of Jethro’s men was trying to make the police target Rynn to get to me.”"
0,“Who is Rynn and where is this?” 
0,“Rynn…”
0,How should I answer…?
0,"I was planning on introducing Rynn to Justin and Sammy eventually, but not this soon."
0,I have not thought of an excuse.
0,"Eydis’s mind raced to find something to tell Justin, but she could not think of anything."
0,The truth was all she had.
0,"“When Jethro had me prisoner, his men were using this girl as their… she was their slave."
0,"When I escaped, I took her with me and found this house."
0,She distrusts humans because of everything that happened to her.
0,I planned to introduce her to you eventually once she opened up more and I was certain she would be accepted.”
0,“Of course she would be accepted.
0,"I accepted you, didn’t I?”"
0,A pain pricked Eydis’s heart.
0,“You did.
0,You did.”
0,I should have brought Rynn with me to Justin.
0,I should have given an excuse then and there.
0,"If I did that, then Jethro’s men never would have found her."
0,She never would have gotten hurt!
0,"But then, there would have been no one to take care of Eydis."
0,Eydis’s chest hurt.
0,The emotional wound in her heart was burning once again.
0,"“Justin, can you wait here for a moment?”"
0,"If I feed on Eydis in her current condition, I will have enough ven to keep Rynn alive, but Eydis will die."
0,"To save Rynn, I will sacrifice the princess."
0,I am sorry Justin.
0,I cannot return her to you.
0,Eydis walked into the hallway.
0,Her hand rose to her mouth.
0,"The door to the closet was not only closed, but a thick layer of melting ice also covered the doorknob and latch."
0,The events that led to Rynn running through the city became clear.
0,"One of Jethro’s men discovered this house, and Rynn used herself as a decoy so that the princess would not be found."
0,Eydis fell to her knees.
0,"“Eydis?” Justin rushed over to her, but she ignored him."
0,She only stared at the frozen door.
0,Rynn risked her life to save Eydis.
0,Why?
0,Was it because I said I would save Eydis’s life?
0,"If I kill Eydis now to save Rynn, I would destroy the sacrifice Rynn made to save her."
0,Rynn would have been injured for nothing!
0,No… Rynn became injured because of my own selfishness.
0,I should have run.
0,I should have left with her and escaped Amel.
0,I never should have helped Jethro!
0,Rynn would have been safe!
0,Justin would have never lost his princess.
0,Sammy would have never lost her dearest friend.
0,"“Eydis, are you okay?”"
0,I can still get ven another way.
0,Eydis grabbed Justin’s arm and pulled him back into the room.
0,“What’s wrong?” Justin held nothing but loving concern in his eyes.
0,Eydis’s heart pounded in her chest.
0,“Lie with me.”
0,“What?” 
0,“I need ven.
0,Lie with me.
0,"Sex is the only way I can restore ven now,” Eydis protested."
0,“Please!”
0,A shadow fell across Justin’s countenance not unlike what Eydis often saw in Rynn.
0,There was something dark in Justin’s past that Eydis did not know.
0,“We can’t.
0,"I can’t,” Justin said as he struggled to voice some hidden torment the suggestion stirred inside him."
0,“Just take my ven.
0,You have expelled my ven and given me ven before.”
0,“I don’t know how!” 
0,Eydis did not have the time for argument.
0,Rynn was dying on the bed beside them.
0,“Please!” 
0,"In Justin’s fearful silence, she steeled herself against what she felt was necessary."
0,Justin’s troubled gaze widened in surprise when Eydis removed her clothes.
0,“Eydis?
0,Don’t do this.” 
0,"Justin’s eyes scanned her naked body, but instead of lust, his fear deepened."
0,Eydis’s hand caressed her tail.
0,Her chest tightened.
0,“Justin… I am sorry.”
0,She grabbed Justin by his shirt and forced him to the floor.
0,"He resisted, but a human’s strength could not compete."
0,“Please!
0,Eydis!
0,Let’s talk through this!”
0,I want to talk!
0,I want to tell you everything.
0,"I want to tell you who I am, WHAT I am."
0,I want you to love me for being me.
0,"I want to talk, but…"
0,“I do not have time!” 
0,Eydis pulled down Justin’s pants and was grateful that he was aroused despite his fear and confusion.
0,“Eydis!
0,Stop!”
0,She shut out Justin’s voice from her mind.
0,"He complained, but Eydis did not listen."
0,"She held him firm, and a stinging pain tore inward, but the amount of ven she was recovering was no different than regular contact."
0,She grabbed Justin’s shirt amid his struggling and removed it too to increase contact so the siphoning of ven would also increase.
0,"“Eydis, if you love me, please stop.”"
0,"Even though Justin’s voice was not a scream, even though she tried to shut him out, his words rang louder in her mind and heart than any former plea."
0,Eydis stopped.
0,She leaned over his body.
0,Tears fell from her eyes onto Justin’s confused and frightened face.
0,Justin wrapped his arms around her and pleaded in her ear.
0,"“Eydis, please."
0,I don’t want to hurt you.”
0,"“Rynn will die,” Eydis cried."
0,"“Is… Is there no other way?” Justin asked, his voice trembling."
0,"“No…” No matter what choice she could have made, she would hurt Justin."
0,"“…Okay,” Justin said."
0,"He no longer resisted, but that did not mean he wanted this."
0,Justin wrapped his arms around her and trembled.
0,He was afraid.
0,"He had some unknown trauma, a deep wound that Eydis was carving open."
0,"Even though he gave his consent, she knew she was hurting him."
0,"He did not want this, and neither did she, not in this way."
0,"There was no going back to the love they had before, even if it was a lie."
0,"Deep down, Eydis wanted love."
0,She wanted a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner with whom she could share her most intimate self.
0,"She had never known love, only abuse, only lies and deceit."
0,She had hope in Justin.
0,He was the first man to ever show her affection.
0,"He helped piece her heart back together and guide her from the wrong path she followed, even if he did not know it."
0,"If there was a man she wanted to share a pure and intimate love with, he was that man, but with each second and each movement of her body, she tore that dream apart piece by piece."
0,There was no going back.
0,Eydis held Justin tight but gently.
0,She apologized to him over and over in her heart.
0,Her body grew tense.
0,The flow of ven grew rapidly.
0,And then Eydis could see it.
0,Justin’s ven was like a vast reservoir of murky water.
0,Her movements chipped away at the dam holding it back until all at once the dam breached.
0,"The murky water spilled over into the small, empty vessel inside Eydis."
0,Justin’s ven capacity was enormous.
0,This level was inhuman.
0,It was inelven.
0,It was far beyond any elfkind.
0,It flowed and flowed and would not stop.
0,She wanted to push away but couldn’t.
0,Her Lurr nature thirsted for the ven and drew out all he would offer until her capacity stretched like a balloon about to burst.
0,"Finally, she let go and the flow of ven stopped."
0,Justin distanced himself.
0,He shuffled back and collapsed against the closed closet door.
0,"He said nothing, only burying his head in his arms."
0,She had done something unforgivable to Justin and knew their relationship ended here.
0,Eydis remained on her back.
0,"The pressure of the ven throughout her body was uncomfortable, almost painful."
0,Her head and all the way to her extremities throbbed with an unfamiliar ache.
0,"Her ven was restored, far more than drinking blood ever could."
0,She needed a moment to recover but could not spare that moment.
0,Eydis bit her inner cheek.
0,She grabbed onto the bedsheets and pulled herself up.
0,"After crawling onto the bed, she checked Rynn’s condition."
0,"Thankfully, Rynn was still alive, but just barely."
0,She immediately began healing the damage.
1,"* * *
Treating Rynn took hours and was not completed until the day was far spent."
0,"Treatment used only a fraction of Eydis’s ven, but the longer the treatment continued, the more ill Eydis felt."
0,"Her body was in physical pain when she finished, but her relief was far stronger."
0,Rynn slept peacefully.
0,"She lost a lot of blood, but she would recover."
0,“How is she?” 
0,Justin remained naked on the floor against the closet.
0,He never moved for the hours Eydis meticulously worked.
0,"She was sure that Justin hated her now, and yet he stayed."
0,“Rynn is fine.
0,She will live.”
0,Relief showed on Justin’s face.
0,“I’m glad.”
0,What can I say to him?
0,“Th… thank you…”
0,“I don’t want your gratitude.
0,I want an explanation!”
0,"Justin looked Eydis in the eyes, but she could not look back, averting her gaze to the floor."
0,“I’ve been thinking these past hours.
0,The difference in personality.
0,The blood I kept smelling on your breath.
0,Your red eyes.
0,Your strength.
0,Your lack of knowledge about magic.
0,The way you speak.
0,This other house.
0,Rynn.
0,Your knowledge about Jethro.
0,Your violence towards others.
0,And this…” Justin shook his head slowly.
0,“I had assumed everything was due to you being assaulted when you were captured or some similar reason causing you to be under a lot of stress or in a lot of pain.
0,I was worried about you.
0,I was so worried about you!” 
0,Justin gritted his teeth.
0,“I want to know the truth.”
0,Eydis’s face contorted in anguish.
0,This was her punishment.
0,“Get dressed.
0,There is something I must show you.”
0,"Chapter 14
“A Plea for Forgiveness”
Eydis"
1,Eydis tucked Rynn into the covers of the bed.
0,Her fingers lightly traced the young girl’s pale cheek.
0,"She was cold, almost as if dead, but the small girl’s weak breathing showed she was alive."
0,That did not remove the fear in Eydis’s heart.
0,"She scanned Rynn’s vitals once again, and a nauseating ache wracked her body from the simple use of life magic, but Eydis paid it no mind."
0,"Her body ached anyway, and she felt it was a meager punishment for what Rynn had to endure and for what she did to Justin, but the scale could not be balanced."
0,"Rynn had endured so much pain, and because of Eydis’s selfish desires, Rynn continued getting hurt."
0,"Justin was innocent like Rynn, but Eydis hurt him too."
0,She glanced behind at him as he dressed.
0,"Her face flushed warm, but it was not from the embarrassment that followed a maiden’s first passionate love."
0,Her heart burned in guilty anguish.
0,"She loved Justin, but because of what she had done, he would never love her."
0,Especially after she showed him the truth.
0,"Eydis dressed, and Justin followed her out the room to the closet."
1,The ice Rynn placed on the door to prevent it from being opened had melted.
0,Eydis led Justin through the closet and down the dark steps.
0,"“The light is broken, so I will stoke the furnace.”"
0,“Is someone down there?” 
0,"Scant light from the hallway filtered into the cellar from the closet, but even in the dark, an occupied bed of blankets could be seen from the stairs."
0,Eydis walked over to the furnace and inserted dry wood.
0,"She lit the tinder with a packet of matches set nearby, but before the flames could take life, Justin realized who slept in the blankets."
0,“It can’t be.” Justin rushed to the princess’s side.
0,"His hand rested against her cheek, trembling."
0,He looked back at Eydis.
0,"His eyes betrayed confusion, doubt, and a plea for explanation."
0,"Eydis felt a suffocating, tight pain in her heart."
0,It constricted her voice to silence the words she was about to speak.
0,"The anguish was unbearable, and breathing felt impossible."
0,She was terrified.
0,"Suppressing her fears and suffocating guilt, she squeezed out the confession stuck in her throat."
0,"“That… that is the true Eydis FeAmel, First Princess of the Amelian Empire.”"
0,Justin’s face froze in disbelief.
0,Slowly the realization of what he just heard seeped into his mind.
0,His hand returned to her cheek and then her forehead.
0,She had a fever.
0,"Her cheeks were sunken, and her lips were cracked."
0,Dark rings shadowed her eyes.
0,She appeared dead if not for the warmth.
0,He shook her lightly.
0,“Eydis.”
0,He shook her harder.
0,“Eydis!”
0,"The chains binding the princess jingled, their sound a warning siren blaring in Eydis’s ears."
0,She never removed the chains for fear that the princess would wake and flee at the first opportunity before Eydis could apologize and explain herself.
0,"She wanted to stop Justin from removing the blanket, but her body would not move."
0,Her guilt paralyzed her.
0,Justin saw the princess’s naked and emaciated body chained to a stake.
0,His hands reached for her but did not touch.
0,They shook as if trying to resist the reality lying before him.
0,He turned to Eydis with pure terror.
0,“What did you do to her?
0,Who are you…?”
0,Justin’s terrified eyes caused even greater anguish.
0,She did not want Justin to look at her like this.
0,He could hate her.
0,Eydis was prepared for that.
0,He could be angry at her.
0,Eydis was prepared for that.
0,"But more than anything, she did not want him to fear her."
0,"Anger may have come from what she did, but his fear came from what she was, a monster."
0,Eydis’s heart shattered.
0,"She sobbed in her hands, and no matter how she tried, she could not voice an answer."
0,The world around her drowned in her pain and sorrow.
0,Her hands fell to her lap lacking the strength to even hide the shame on her anguished face.
0,"Her voice wailed out, but no one would be there to hear it."
0,No comfort would come.
0,She was alone.
0,A firm hand gripped Eydis’s shoulder.
0,"She grasped out, and her hands found fabric."
0,She buried her face in the warmth it covered.
0,Her wailing continued as the scent that had once brought her comfort now only increased the aching of her heart.
0,"A second hand grasped her other shoulder to push her off, but she held fast to the warmth begging and pleading through her tears for the comfort to return."
0,“Stop!
0,Stop crying.” 
0,The hands gripping Eydis’s shoulders shook.
0,“I can’t…” The voice trembled.
0,“I can’t stand seeing someone with Eydis’s face crying like this.”
0,The voice fell silent.
0,His hands gripped tighter and tighter as Eydis’s unceasing tears drenched his shirt until finally the grip eased.
0,"A hesitant arm wrapped around Eydis’s shoulder, and it held her close to the warmth."
0,“I… I don’t know what drove you to do this to Eydis.” 
0,The arms held Eydis tighter.
0,"“I can’t… I don’t believe that the care, the kindness you’ve… The way you protected Sammy and healed Chloe."
0,The way you worked with the police to help save lives and fight those from your world.
0,I can’t believe that was all an act.
0,"I don’t know why you did this to Eydis, but I don’t think that someone who feels this bad over what they’ve done can be that evil.”"
0,Rynn’s words floated in Eydis’s mind.
0,“No monster would feel this pain.
0,A monster would not feel remorse.”
0,"“I can’t forgive you, but I can at least try to understand you.” "
0,"Eydis’s hoarse wailing reduced to sobs, but she still held firm to Justin, fearing that he would disappear if she let go, leaving her alone."
0,"She fought to stifle her cries, but it only made her choke."
0,“Please.
0,Talk to me.
0,I told you that I would listen.”
0,“Sorry…” Eydis’s voice escaped in a hoarse whisper.
0,She wrapped her arms around Justin.
0,“I am so sorry… sorry… sorry…”
0,Justin gently lifted Eydis off him.
0,“I said I don’t want your apologies.”
0,Eydis’s head hung low.
0,“Eydis.”
0,She looked up at Justin.
0,He was no longer afraid.
0,"His face was rigid from suppressed anger, but his deep blue eyes expressed honest concern."
0,“Talk to me.”
0,Eydis nodded slowly.
0,"She wiped the tears from her eyes, but more fell."
0,"With a hoarse voice, Eydis told her story."
0,"“Princess Eydis created me almost a year ago, maybe ten years in your time…”"
0,She explained how she was raised to believe she was the Amelian Princess in order to be a body-double for use in emergencies.
0,"She told of the fall of the Amelian Empire, of Jethro, and with bitterness and pain, she recounted her struggle with the Alukah and how she found out what she was."
0,"She continued with her reluctant agreement to help Jethro, recounting with anger how she met and saved Rynn from Austin, and how she came to Justin’s world."
0,"Her heart choked out painful tears as she hid nothing from Justin about capturing the princess, her abuse, and how because of her nature as a doppelganger, she pushed the princess near death, that the princess was going to die."
0,"“But… because of Rynn, Sammy, and you, I realized that was not who I am."
0,"I wanted to make everything right, but I was scared."
0,I did not want you and Sammy to find out what I was.
0,"I did not want you to fear me, so I decided to do everything I could to save Eydis."
0,I planned to tell her everything and then let her go back where she belongs.
0,I would then leave the city with Rynn.
0,You and Sammy would never know about me.”
0,Eydis gazed at Justin with yearning in her red and swollen eyes.
0,"“I love you, but I cannot lie to myself."
0,I can never be with you.
0,Not after everything I have done.”
0,Justin sat silent with his head hung low.
0,Eydis could not see his expression.
0,Her tale overwhelmed him.
0,She slid next to the true Eydis.
0,"“I cannot recover my own ven like she does, so I could not help her much, but because of you, I have plenty."
0,I will use it all to try and help her.
0,"I should, after what I did to you."
0,"It is your ven, not mine."
0,She will recover after that.
0,I hope.
0,"She is already recovering slowly, and this should help."
0,"I will let you take her, but please… please do not tell Sammy about me."
0,I do not want her to hurt because of me…”
0,Eydis placed her hand on the princess’s forehead.
0,"She used life magic to help boost the princess’s natural healing, the magic now far more potent than her previous treatments over the past few days due to her excess of ven obtained from Justin."
0,"With this, Eydis hoped that the princess’s body would stop converting its vital ven to sustain itself and allow the princess to slowly leave the critical levels, making her healthier."
0,She was only able to heal a little before sharp pain wracked her nerves far stronger than the constant ache.
0,Her stomach grew nauseous.
0,Eydis quickly turned aside and vomited.
0,"Justin rushed to the princess’s side, not caring for Eydis’s sickness."
0,“What happened?”
0,Eydis recalled when the princess nearly killed her with life magic.
0,Did Eydis attack me?
0,Is she conscious enough?
0,"No, this is different."
0,Eydis placed her hand on the princess’s forehead and attempted to read her vitals.
0,"Intense pain and nausea returned stronger than before, causing Eydis to wretch."
0,Impossible.
0,“I… I cannot use magic.”
1,“Did I just hear you can’t use magic?
0,My English is quite bad.”
0,A minum looked down at them from between the wooden beams at the top of the steps.
0,“Is that a minum?” .
0,Justin quickly covered the princess when fear replaced his surprise
0,"“Of course, I couldn’t use it anymore either because I spent too much in that little experiment with your pet sprig."
0,Had to sit and rest a bit.
0,I’m surprised you didn’t evacuate this place while I was gone.”
0,How could I be so foolish?!
0,"This place was discovered, and I came back here!"
0,"Eydis rose to one knee, but the minum waved his hand."
0,“Don’t get any ideas.
0,"From where I am standing, I can just see into the bedroom where your sprig is sleeping."
0,My fire magic works by sight.
0,I can burn that room to ash in an instant.”
0,Eydis gritted her teeth.
0,“What do you want?”
0,“A trade.
0,How about the sleeping Forrest Elf for the sleeping High Elf?”
0,Justin’s lack of reaction showed that the princess had not taught him Elven.
0,He did not understand the conversation.
0,I just promised to give Eydis back to Justin.
0,What am I to do?
0,"Even if his magic works by sight, he is looking at me."
0,"If I charge him, he might have time to go to the room and kill Rynn directly."
0,"If I can kill him with Jethro’s barrier magic, even if he sets fire to the bedroom, I should be able to get there before Rynn is hurt."
0,"Eydis tried to channel spatial magic into her hand, but the excruciating pain returned."
0,She lurched over and her body throbbed.
0,Sweat streamed off her from the shock.
0,"She could only stare at the floor that rapidly heated beneath her, unable to move or think."
0,"The floor soon cooled, and no fire appeared."
0,“Scared me for a moment.
0,Looks like I heard right.
0,Spent all your ven healing your pet?
0,No more tricks.
0,You… umm…” The minum rubbed his forehead.
0,“That… girl?
0,To me.
0,Give me.”
0,He pointed at the princess and gestured for Justin to bring her to him.
0,Justin understood and pulled the princess closer.
0,“Like hell I’m giving her to you!”
0,The minum pointed out the cellar and lit a flame in his hand.
0,“That girl.
0,You give me!”
0,Justin realized Rynn was now a hostage.
0,The girl that Eydis cared for more than anything was being held in return for the princess.
0,He looked around the room for anything that could diffuse or delay the situation.
0,"He held the princess close, and the chains binding her ran taut."
0,Justin grabbed the chains and shook them.
0,“These chains!
0,I can’t move Eydis with these chains!”
0,The minum shook his head.
0,“Monster!
0,"If you don’t want your pet to die, unchain the princess.”"
0,Eydis looked over at the princess.
0,Phlegm that regurgitated from nausea dripped from her lips.
0,"The worst of the pain subsided, but the severity had been debilitating to the point of paralysis."
0,She feared to move.
0,She could barely think.
0,"Only her eyes wandered over to a small, rusted metal box sitting on the middle shelf lining the wall."
0,It was the sole box amid many jars of preserved food.
0,Justin’s eyes followed Eydis’s gaze to the same location.
0,The minum also took notice.
0,“You!
0,That!” he ordered.
0,Justin set the princess gently on the blankets and retrieved the box.
0,"He pulled out an incredibly thin, three-toothed key made of the same metal as the chains."
0,"One by one, he inserted the key into tiny holes that ran across each shackle."
0,"The shackles separated from the princess’s ankles, wrists, and the chain itself."
0,She was free.
0,“To me.
0,Give girl.”
0,Justin supported the princess’s body with one arm hooked under her legs and held her close to his chest with his other.
0,Her head rested limp on his shoulder.
0,"Slowly he ascended the steps, and Eydis could do nothing but watch."
0,"Justin,  I am sorry."
0,“No say.
0,Walk.” The minum waited until Justin passed before turning to follow.
0,“You should have never betrayed Jethro’s trust.
0,"Consider yourself fortunate that he still has interest in you, otherwise you would be dead.”"
0,"After that parting warning, he vanished from sight."
0,I chose Rynn over Justin.
0,I chose her over my promise to him.
0,"Eydis wanted to cry, but no more tears fell."
0,They had run dry.
1,The sound of a struggle and crash came from the closet.
0,“Eydis!
0,He set fire to the bedroom!”
0,"In a burst of adrenaline, Eydis shot up the steps and through the closet."
0,Justin leaned against the wall in the hallway in front of the bedroom door.
0,He was in pain.
0,A charred and blistering burn covered his shin where the fabric of his pant leg burned away.
0,The minum clung to a toppled chair in the kitchen to pull himself off the floor.
0,An ear-splitting alarm rang to Eydis’s left.
0,The bedroom glowed orange.
0,Eydis ran inside to find the bed in flames.
0,She tore off the burning blankets and grabbed Rynn.
0,The thick covers insulated Rynn from the heat.
0,"If Justin had not kicked the minum away, Eydis knew Rynn would have died."
0,“Stupid human!”
0,Justin dove into the bedroom onto his back with the princess in his arms.
0,A pillar of fire erupted from the floor where he was standing.
0,"The hallway caught fire, and the billowing heat made Justin groan through his teeth from the burn on his leg."
0,Their escape was cut off.
0,The burning bed and blanket filled the room with smoke.
0,Justin held his shirt over the princess’s mouth and nose and searched for a way out.
0,He kicked Eydis to the other side of the bed and dove with the princess into the closet door.
0,Another pillar of flame shot from the floor where Eydis had been standing.
0,Justin had incredible timing and reflexes from his time magic.
0,A sudden realization came to Eydis.
0,The minum’s magic worked by sight.
0,He was in the room.
0,Eydis hooked her arm under the heavy wooden frame of the bed and flung it at the door.
0,Justin limped to Eydis’s side and to the broken window.
0,"Still holding the princess with one arm, he unlatched the window and pulled it up, but it would not hold on its own."
0,He held it open and nudged Eydis with his knee.
0,“Go!”
0,Eydis climbed through and pulled Rynn through after her.
0,"Justin lifted the princess’s legs, and Eydis pulled her the rest of the way."
0,"“Justin, hurry!” Eydis screamed."
0,Justin lifted his injured leg to the window but dove away.
0,A fiery explosion blew out the window knocking Eydis to her back.
0,“Justin!”
0,"Eydis left Rynn and the princess in the yard and jumped through the window, breaking the frame."
0,Justin lay on the floor struggling to lift himself.
0,Burns marked his arms and face.
0,She could not see the minum.
0,"She grabbed him and was about to jump through the window again, but an explosion erupted right in front of her."
0,She jumped backwards by reflex with all her strength.
1,"The wall behind her buckled from the force of her impact, and she rolled onto the gravel path on the side of the house while cradling Justin."
0,"Even without magic, she was still strong."
0,"For the first time, Eydis was grateful to be a Lurr."
0,Eydis called Justin’s name while carrying him over to Rynn and the princess.
0,"He was mildly disoriented, but he found focus after she patted him on the cheek a few times."
0,A crowd of people gathered at the edge of the property.
0,There were panicked voices and strange accusations from those who saw the fire and that the girls were not human.
0,Eydis ignored them and called out.
0,“Please!
0,Someone help them!”
0,"“Eydis, I’m okay.” "
0,Justin separated himself from Eydis and picked up the princess.
0,He hissed through his teeth from the burns and nearly fell again from his injured leg.
0,Two men and a woman ran over to help.
0,The woman placed her coat over Rynn and picked her up.
0,She showed no fear of Rynn’s appearance.
0,Justin pulled Eydis away.
0,Fire shot up from the ground.
0,The crowd screamed and fled in panic.
0,He dove into Eydis and knocked her to the ground.
0,A second pillar of fire shot up.
0,"“Take those two and run,” he shouted to the crowd."
0,The two cowering men listened to Justin and grabbed Rynn from the woman and the princess from the yard.
0,“You go too!
0,You are hurt!” Eydis ordered.
0,“You can’t use magic anymore.
0,I can still help!”
0,"Justin tried to pull Eydis to the side, but his injured leg slipped on the slick grass."
0,Eydis kicked back and flung Justin into the air.
0,They barely avoided the fire.
0,She caught Justin in her arms and then pushed him towards the crowd.
0,He stumbled over his injured leg and fell.
0,“Sammy was right.
0,All you can do is dodge!
0,Go with them.
0,"Make sure those two are safe, and do not let anyone touch Rynn’s horns."
0,"Unlike you, I can still fight without magic.” Eydis’s eyes glowed red."
0,They were no longer the burning crimson embers of a monster but the radiant glow of a polished ruby.
0,"“After all, I am a Lurr.”"
0,Justin grimaced and hobbled toward the crowd.
0,“It’s dangerous here!
0,Everyone Evacuate.”
0,"A man offered Justin his shoulder, and they followed the two carrying Rynn and the princess down the road."
0,Why am I not being attacked?
0,"Eydis looked around, and her keen Lurr eyes noticed a strange blur moving in the dark along the edge of the property in the direction of the fleeing crowd."
0,The minum can turn invisible.
0,That’s why she never saw him in the assault.
0,Eydis grabbed a disc-shaped cement slab from the garden bed lining the front of the house and flung it at the blur.
0,"Her aim was off, but it hit the ground and shot out dirt and debris."
0,The minum’s invisibility magic dispersed in the spray of dirt that knocked him to the ground.
0,Eydis ran at full speed to catch him before he could recover.
0,"She grabbed his ankle and was about to tear him apart, but his leg grew an intense flame."
0,She flung him away towards the house to avoid getting caught in the fire and to separate him from Justin and the fleeing crowd.
0,He bounced off the roof and into the back yard.
0,"The damage would not be fatal because of the minum’s incredibly light weight in this world, but hopefully he had a broken bone or two."
0,"“I hate those wretched Lurr,” the minum shouted from the back yard."
0,Eydis jumped the overgrown shrubbery lining the back fence but was blown back by an explosion that destroyed the side of the house.
0,"The windows of the neighboring homes shattered, and scattering flames set the neighboring houses ablaze."
0,The power was unlike the human mage she fought before.
0,This was the proper strength of the minum breed that could compete with the elfkind as equals in magic.
0,"Her body ached, but she was not injured."
0,The pain could not compare to her attempts to use magic.
0,"She only felt it for a moment until it was drowned out in her incessant, agonizing nausea."
0,Eydis ran back to the yard and found it empty.
0,She ignored the noise of the fire and focused on anything else that might give away the minum’s location.
0,The rustling of grass and leaves.
0,A snapping twig.
0,“The forest!”
1,The minum ran as fast as his small legs could carry him.
0,"There was no way he could compete against a Lurr’s strength, and his ven was likely running low."
0,Eydis counted on this and pursued.
0,She saw him in the distance before long.
0,She picked up a large fallen branch and broke it into smaller pieces as she ran.
0,"She tossed each one, but like the cement slab before, her aim was terrible."
0,The first shattered against a tree.
0,The other two flew the correct direction but far overshot her target.
0,"There she saw it, the black portal that devoured all light entering it like a deep cavern in the night air."
0,She could not let him escape back to Jethro.
0,Eydis picked up speed and ran with all her might.
0,The uneven ground made movement difficult.
0,Her foot slipped on a patch of mud and sent her tumbling over the dirt and brush into a tree that shook heavily from the impact.
0,"Air expelled from her lungs and would not return, but she couldn’t stop."
0,"The portal was close, and the minum was nearly upon it."
0,Eydis ran once more despite her suffocation.
0,She aimed for the portal.
0,The minum glanced behind him in terror.
0,"When she was almost close enough to grab him, the minum jumped in."
0,Eydis kicked off the ground to avoid the portal and crashed through the branches of a nearby tree.
0,She could not risk entering the portal.
0,It was made for the minum and him alone.
0,"If she tried to go through, the portal may have collapsed and killed her."
0,"Even if she survived, Jethro would be waiting on the other side."
0,She could not catch the minum.
0,Eydis wiped the mud and leaves from her face and looked back.
0,The portal was gone.
0,"Chapter 15
“The End of Preparation. The Beginning of Action.”"
1,“Close the portal now!”
0,Jethro immediately obeyed but did not show any concern.
0,“Are all your missions going to end like this?
0,At least you look far better than last time.
0,Care to explain?”
0,Fect brushed himself off and rubbed the large bruise on his cheek from bouncing off the roof of the house.
0,He felt justified by his aches.
0,"“Mission successful, sir,” he announced with a wide grin."
1,"* * *
Sammy was a nervous wreck."
0,"While watching the morning news from a small-time local station during breakfast in her dorm lounge, she saw the reports of a demon setting people on fire."
0,"Anyone else would have questioned the validity of such an absurd report, but she knew better."
0,Jethro’s men returned.
0,The news report cut to the helicopter feed of a police stand-off against what looked like a child with horns.
0,"She immediately called Justin, but he wouldn’t pick up."
0,The child was shot on live television just before Eydis appeared on the scene.
0,The helicopter feed then cut out leaving both the newscaster and Sammy stunned.
0,"Justin called back in not too long, stating that he was with Major Wickenny on his way to the location, but that was the last she heard from him."
0,"For the rest of the day, Sammy called Justin over and over, but he never answered or called her back."
0,"She tried calling Sean, Chloe, and Miriam, but neither of them had heard anything."
0,She did not have Major Wickenny’s phone number either.
0,Any attempt to contact the police station was met with a denial of information.
0,She could only wait.
0,She skipped classes and stayed tuned to the news and internet as reports trickled in on the aftereffects.
0,Seventeen civilians confirmed dead with eleven more injured.
0,Five police in critical condition.
0,The military was called in to intervene and suppress the threat.
0,"All the while, Sammy could not contact Eydis or Justin."
0,"Finally, she received a call from Sean."
0,He was en route to pick her up.
0,Justin and Eydis were admitted to the hospital.
0,Justin was hurt and Eydis was ill and unresponsive.
0,“Have you heard anything else?” Sammy asked.
0,Sean shook his head.
0,"“Major Wickenny did not know much, only what the dispatch and ambulance told him.”"
0,Sammy fiddled with the zipper on her coat in a futile attempt to calm her nerves.
0,“We’ll be able to hear everything from Justin when we get there.”
0,The hospital was still in operation.
0,"There was no other hospital for miles, and the hospital itself was rather large, servicing the surrounding farmlands and neighboring cities."
0,All the fire damage from the minum was secluded to the lobby and top floor of a single wing of one building in the hospital’s complex.
0,Sean pulled up to the emergency entrance and dropped Sammy off at the curb before parking.
1,Sammy ran inside and to the reception desk.
0,“Justin Hapfeld and Eydis FeAmel.
0,What rooms are they in?”
0,The receptionist looked up the names.
0,Her eyes narrowed.
0,"“That’s the… I’m sorry, but no one is allowed to visit by orders of the police.”"
0,“I know Major Wickenny!
0,I’m a part of all this!” 
0,Sammy struggled to keep her tears of worry from falling.
0,The receptionist grew troubled but picked up the office phone.
0,“Just a moment.”
0,Sammy sat in the lobby and waited.
0,The receptionist called a second number and then a third.
0,"With each new call, Sammy’s anxiety worsened."
0,Sean walked in and sat down next to her.
0,The anticipation and anxiety ate at Sammy as the minutes ticked on.
0,She continued fiddling with her zipper until it broke off the bottom of her jacket.
0,“Goddamn it!”
0,She threw the zipper across the room and buried her face in her hands.
0,"Sean placed his hand on her shoulder to comfort her, but Sammy swatted it away."
0,“Don’t let Miriam see you doing that.”
0,Sean could only sigh.
0,"“Sammy,” a voice called."
0,Sammy dashed to the reception desk.
0,“I have received permission to let you see them.
0,Is that Sean with you?”
0,“Yes it is.
0,What room number?”
0,The receptionist handed Sammy a slip of paper and pressed a button that unlocked the door beside the counter.
0,Sammy grabbed the sleeve of Sean’s jacket and yanked him through the door.
1,Sammy grew more and more frustrated with each wrong turn.
0,“Why do they make these places so confusing?!”
0,"“Keep your voice down,” Sean whispered."
0,“It’s early morning.
0,Patients could be sleeping.
0,We could ask someone.”
0,“Do you see anyone to ask?” 
0,"They continued walking through the halls of the hospital trying to follow the numbers on the doors, but the hall they walked down reached a dead end before the door numbers increased to match what they needed."
0,Sammy fumed.
0,She crumpled the paper in her hand and walked back down the other direction.
0,"At the opening to the hallway, a nurse waved them down."
0,“Are you Sammy and Sean?”
0,Sammy ran over to the nurse.
0,“Where is room 146?”
0,“It’s at the end of the next hallway down.” 
0,“But those numbers are decreasing!” 
0,“There was a remodel some years ago.
0,"About halfway down the hall, the numbers jump up and continue from where this hallway ends."
0,Sorry for the confusion.
0,Make sure to tell the guards your names or they won’t let you in.”
0,Sammy thanked the nurse and pulled Sean around the corner.
0,"She took the next right and hurried down the hall to a small waiting area with blue, padded benches."
0,A single door sat to the side.
0,Two fully armed military personnel stood guard on both sides of the door.
0,"They not only wore their combat helmet and tactical vest, they were even holding some large rifle that Sammy did not recognize."
0,They looked ready for combat at a moment’s notice.
0,“We are Sammy and Sean.” 
0,Sammy gave a haphazard salute and pulled Sean through the door after one of the soldiers nodded.
1,The large room contained three full-sized hospital beds and had room for a fourth.
0,The two beds on the left had their curtains drawn shut.
0,Justin sat up alone on the bed on the right.
0,"Aside from a bandaged leg and some burns that did not look too severe, he appeared alright."
0,A rush of relief overcame Sammy.
0,He acknowledged Sammy and Sean but then returned his stare to the curtain across from him.
0,Sammy ran over and spoke in a loud whisper.
0,“What happened?” Her eyes scanned his wrapped shin and the oiled burns on his face and arms.
0,“I’m fine.
0,It’s only a burn.
0,I don’t need a graft.”
0,"“A graft,” Sammy repeated in panic, staring at his bound leg."
0,Justin would not have brought up a graft unless it was serious enough to be considered by the doctors.
0,“How bad is it?”
0,"“I’m fine,” Justin repeated."
0,“I just have the burns and a concussion.”
0,“And Eydis?” 
0,Justin nodded towards the bed across from him.
0,Sammy peeked behind the curtain.
0,Her hand rose to her mouth.
0,"Her gut sank, and her breath grew short."
0,“What happened?
0,She looks terrible!”
0,Justin’s head hung low.
0,Sammy ran back to his side and grabbed his arm.
0,“Tell me everything!”
0,“Sammy…” Sean pulled Sammy away from Justin.
0,“Is it something you can’t tell?”
0,“I don’t give a damn.
0,I need to know!” 
0,Sammy’s eyes welled with tears.
0,“She’s my friend too!”
0,Justin’s hands balled into fists.
0,"“It was life magic,” he finally said."
0,Justin explained how Jethro’s men had sent an innocent girl to this world in order to frame her as an enemy and get the police and military to attack.
0,Their goal was to draw Eydis out of hiding.
0,Eydis fought back against the police in order to save the girl’s life but was forced to surrender once the military arrived.
0,"Jethro’s men were still there but hidden, so Eydis used a random teleport to bring them to some empty house in the city."
0,"Eydis used all her ven to heal the injured girl, but a minum that could use both life and fire magic found them."
0,“Eydis was at a disadvantage because she had to protect all of us without her ven.
0,The fight was noticed by the neighbors.
0,I don’t think that Jethro’s men want to be found because the minum fled once the crowd grew too large.
0,"By then, Eydis had collapsed."
0,It was probably magic to make her too weak to resist capture.
0,"I couldn’t carry both Eydis and the girl, so the neighbors helped us evacuate the area.”"
0,“Is that bed over there…?” Sammy began.
0,"“Yah, that’s the girl."
0,"I think she might be a different kind of elf than Eydis, but Eydis never told me what she was.”"
0,Sammy peeked around the curtain.
0,“She looks twelve.
0,How could they use a child as bait?
0,Is she okay?”
0,"“I don’t know when she’ll wake, but I trust Eydis’s healing abilities.” "
0,"“Sammy, can I speak with Justin in private for a moment?”"
0,"Sean looked serious, so Sammy found it hard to argue despite not wanting to be left out of the discussion."
0,"Sean and Justin knew each other far longer than Sammy, and as men, there may have been things that only they could discuss together."
0,"Reluctantly, she left the room."
0,“Make it quick!”
1,Sean pulled up a chair next to Justin and spoke with a soft yet serious tone.
0,“What you told Sammy was a lie.
0,I was with Major Wickenny as the reports came in after you and Eydis disappeared.
0,Those that saw the fight said there were two people who matched Eydis’s description.
0,Tell me the truth.”
0,Justin was not surprised.
0,“Major Wickenny and Colonel Richards already spoke with me.
0,"They have the general idea of what happened, but they agreed to keep it a secret within the police and military at my request."
0,"What I told Sammy, can you treat that as the truth, please?”"
0,Sean looked at Justin’s pained expression.
0,"This was a conversation that he could not press too far, but he had to make sure."
0,"“The one that has been with us since Eydis disappeared was an imposter, wasn’t it."
0,So much could be explained if that was the case.”
0,"Justin did not answer, but Sean took his silence as affirmation."
0,"“I don’t know why you want to keep it a secret, especially from Sammy, and I hope it’s more than to hide your shame or protect your ego, but I will trust you."
0,"However, you need to tell her eventually."
0,She might already suspect it as Miriam and I did.”
0,"Sean called Sammy back into the room, and their visitation continued, but Justin did not contribute much to the conversations."
0,"Just before sunrise, Sean suggested they leave."
0,"Sammy wanted to stay, but Sean convinced her to give Justin some peace so he could rest."
0,Sammy argued but eventually agreed and promised to be back later that day.
0,Justin was left alone once more unable to sleep and spent his waking hours staring at the curtain around Eydis’s bed.
1,"* * *
Later that morning, the nurse gave Justin permission to sleep, but he was awoken only a couple hours later by the screaming of a girl."
0,"The curtains had been drawn from the young elf’s bed, and two nurses tried to comfort the child."
0,"None of the nurses could understand the words the girl cried, but Justin recognized it as Elven and was able to pick out a name from her screams."
0,“Rynn wants Eydis.”
0,"One of the nurses heard and pulled the curtain around Eydis’s bed to the side to show Rynn, but Rynn only screamed louder."
0,"She wanted the other Eydis, but he could not tell them."
0,Justin did not know what happened to the other Eydis after he fled the fight.
0,He did not even know if she was still alive or if she was captured or lying injured somewhere unable to recover if she still could not use magic.
0,He sat feeling helpless as he watched the poor girl cry.
0,“Wait… Stop!”
0,One of the nurses held gauze in her hands.
0,The left horn on Rynn’s head was bleeding.
0,“Don’t touch her horns!” 
0,Justin stumbled out of bed and grabbed the nurse’s arm.
0,"“Don’t touch her horns,” he repeated."
0,"The nurse stepped back in shock, fearing that she might have done something terribly wrong or dangerous."
0,“We were trying to stop the bleeding.
0,Her blood levels are already dangerously low.
0,We can’t give her a transfusion because her blood is different.
0,We don’t know how her body will react.
0,She can’t risk losing any more.”
0,“Eydis is more knowledgeable about elves than any of us.
0,She told me to not let anyone touch her horns.
0,"If the bleeding was an issue, she never would have said that.”"
0,Rynn stared at Justin.
0,She was terrified.
0,Justin racked his brain to piece together the little Elven that Eydis had taught him.
0,"She told him to focus on one thing at a time, feeling and expelling his toxic ven first, so the Elven he could convince her to teach him was limited."
0,Justin’s mouth hung open.
0,“That’s what was wrong!”
0,The nurses started in surprise at his sudden shout.
0,"Rynn cowered, her budding tears about to fall."
0,“Sorry.
0,I just realized something unrelated.” 
0,He returned to piecing together something in Elven and looked at Rynn with the most comforting smile he could.
0,“It is fine.
0,You are fine.”
0,Tears fell from Rynn’s eyes.
0,“Eydis…”
0,"“Eydis is fine,” Justin repeated."
0,"Rynn shook her head, pointed at Eydis in the bed next to her, and cried something in Elven that Justin could not understand, but he was sure he knew what she meant."
0,He stood between Rynn’s pointed finger and Eydis’s bed and shook his head.
0,“No.
0,Eydis.
0,Eydis is fine.”
0,There was a chance that the words he spoke were a lie.
0,All he could do was attempt to comfort the scared girl.
0,Rynn calmed down and nodded her head.
0,She understood.
0,She then collapsed back on her bed thoroughly exhausted.
0,"Having lost so much blood, she could not have had much energy, especially not enough to fight against two nurses, being so small and light."
0,“What should we do about the bleeding?” one nurse asked.
0,“Can we wrap something around her forehead to at least catch the blood?”
0,The two nurses still looked concerned.
0,"“I’ll do it,” Justin offered."
0,“I might have better luck than you.”
0,The nurses agreed and handed Justin a long strip of gauze and a rolled-up bandage.
0,"When he approached Rynn’s bedside, she grew afraid once again."
0,“No.
0,It is fine.”
0,"Justin unrolled the bandage and wrapped it around his forehead to hold the gauze in place, showing her what he planned to do."
0,Rynn watched intently.
0,“It is fine.
0,You?”
0,"Justin pointed to Rynn, and she winced by reflex."
0,She struggled to sit up and nodded hesitantly.
0,A nurse handed Justin a new packaged bandage and a new strip of gauze.
0,"When Justin reached over to Rynn, she cowered again."
0,"She did not resist his aid, but she trembled with fear while Justin wrapped the bandage around her head as if even his proximity to her was painful."
0,"He then requested more gauze, slid it carefully behind her horns, and wrapped it in place as well."
0,One of the nurses then leaned over and taped the bandages down.
0,"Tears fell from the girl’s eyes when he finished, and Justin knew they were not of gratitude."
0,She was terrified.
0,Justin stepped back away from the bed hoping that would help calm her fears.
0,"After Justin distanced himself, the young elf calmed."
0,"Rynn felt her bandages and then wiped the tears off her cheeks, but she continued staring at Justin warily."
0,"When the nurses helped lay Rynn back into her bed, they did not elicit the same terrified reaction."
0,"Perhaps she was scared of him, and placing the bandages on was even more terrifying for her."
0,He should have let the nurses do it.
0,"His cursed his arrogance in thinking that because he was associated with the fake Eydis, he would be better for the task."
0,"Not wanting to trouble the girl further, Justin returned to his own bed."
0,"He was still exhausted, and it was the nurse’s job to help her anyway."
0,“Can we check your bandages before you go back to sleep?” a nurse asked.
0,Justin sighed but agreed.
0,"There was bleeding, and the burns stung through his painkillers, especially when exposed to open air, but the damage was far less than what could have been."
0,He kicked a minum in the face while that minum used sight-based fire magic.
0,He could have lost his leg or caught fire.
0,"Seeing Rynn alive and resting in the bed across the room from him, he was glad he did it."
0,"Once the nurse finished, Justin went back to sleep and slept through Sammy’s visit later that afternoon."
1,Someone shook Justin’s shoulder.
0,He turned to his side and ignored it.
0,The shaking continued.
0,“Justin.”
0,That voice.
0,Justin shot up and nearly hit the owner of the voice with his head.
0,The room was dark.
0,No nurses or doctors were present.
0,“You usually have a harder time waking up than that.
0,"I do not have food to bribe you with this time, so I was a little worried.” The voice laughed dryly."
0,“Eydis?”
0,The fake Eydis sat at his bedside.
0,Her red eyes shined with a subdued glow.
0,"Justin was filled with mixed emotions of relief, which surprised him, and sorrow that she was not the real Eydis."
0,“What happened with the minum?
0,How did you get in here?” he asked.
0,“Can I hold your hand?
0,I need to recover ven.”
0,“You can use magic again?”
0,She shook her head.
0,“But you couldn’t have gotten in otherwise.”
0,"“Even though my ven is almost full, I cannot use it without a lot of pain."
0,"If I can recover the tiny bit that remains empty, I can use magic with only a little pain."
0,"Even now, I feel rather ill.” Her face in the dark looked as one who was in the worst throes of a terrible flu."
0,"Eydis held out her hand, but Justin hesitated."
0,She retracted it and looked dejected as if she expected he would not help her.
0,"“I think I know what is wrong with you,” Justin explained."
0,“You are not the first person this happened to.”
0,“You mean…” Eydis looked over at the sleeping princess.
0,Justin quickly corrected himself.
0,"“No, two others, years ago."
0,They got sick just like you.” 
0,The dark trauma of his past haunted his expression once again.
0,“That… that’s why I tried to stop you.
0,I didn’t want to hurt you.
0,After what Eydis--the other Eydis--has taught me and seeing what happened to you after you…” 
0,Justin hesitated to vocalize her assault on him.
0,"“Anyway, I think my ven is the problem.”"
0,Eydis pleaded silently to Justin for an explanation.
0,“You have ven poisoning.
0,"When my body recovers ven, some of it turns toxic."
0,It even harms me when too much builds up.
0,Every day or so Eydis would force the toxic ven out of me.
0,"After she disappeared, and even when you took her place, the toxic ven was never removed."
0,It never even occurred to me to ask you to do it.”
0,"“If you had, you would have found out fast that I was a fake,” Eydis replied."
0,“You can’t do it either?”
0,Eydis shook her head.
0,"“If I could, I would be able to fix myself right now."
0,The control a Lurr has over its ven is severely limited.
0,"I can convert it in order to use it just fine, but I cannot recover it or manipulate it."
0,"As much as I tried, I could not give it to Eydis to help her recover."
0,I tried over and over again.”
0,“That means the only way to remove it would be…”
0,Eydis bit her inner cheek.
0,“I have to use it…” 
0,Her body shivered at the prospect.
0,"Justin knew how much his migraines hurt, but from how Eydis reacted when she tried to use magic against the minum, toxic ven was far worse."
0,"Even the true Eydis had told him that using the toxic ven was “very, very painful” whereas extracting it was “much less painful.” "
0,"When she forced out all his toxic ven the night he had the migraine, he felt like he was dying."
0,It was the most painful experience of his life.
0,He could not imagine a pain that was much worse.
0,“That’s why I don’t think you should get your ven from me.”
0,Eydis smiled weakly.
0,"“No, it should be fine."
0,I have been holding you and touching you all this time without any problems.
0,I only take a small part of what you are currently regenerating.”
0,"“Then, you won’t take the ven that becomes poisoned by me."
0,Eydis said that good ven is always used first.”
0,Eydis held out her hand in pleading.
0,Justin hesitated but grasped it.
0,Her smile widened ever so slightly.
0,"“I also wanted to hold your hand one last time,” she confessed."
0,Something sunk in Justin’s chest.
0,He unconsciously gripped her hand a little tighter.
0,“That means you are leaving the city?”
0,“No. One of the reasons I came here was to tell you that the minum got away.
0,There was a portal back to my world waiting nearby in the forest.
0,I am sure that is how they found Rynn.
0,It was so close to where we were hiding.
0,"I will remain in Gullivan for now and look out for Jethro’s soldiers, but you will not see me."
0,"Now that Princess Eydis is back, I… I no longer have a place with you.”"
0,"Justin wanted to tell her different, but deep down he had not forgiven her for what she did even knowing the circumstances that led her to take such harrowing actions."
0,He doubted that Sammy or anyone else would either.
0,“I should tell you this at least.
0,The police and military know you exist.
0,Sean also came to that conclusion himself.
0,Maybe Miriam too.”
0,“I thought Sean might.
0,He questions everything.
0,What about Sammy?”
0,“I haven’t told her.
0,I also asked Sean and anyone who knew to keep it a secret.
0,It all depends on what Eydis does when she wakes.
0,"I will talk to her, but the choice is hers.”"
0,Eydis looked across the room to the other Eydis’s bed.
0,She let go of Justin and placed her hand on the sickly elf’s forehead.
0,"After wincing from pain, she returned and grabbed Justin’s hand again."
0,“Her ven levels are finally rising.
0,"She is not out of danger yet, but she is recovering."
0,She is amazing.
0,I do not think a human could have survived what I put her through.
0,"High Elves have incredible vitality, and she’s not even a Lurr.”"
0,“Because of their life affinity.” Justin smirked.
0,"“That’s what she says, so it has to be true.”"
0,“Her life magic was the only thing keeping her alive.”
0,Awkward silence filled the room.
0,Part of Justin wanted to go back to when he believed this Eydis was the true Eydis.
0,"He was happy in his ignorance, especially when his feelings for Eydis were returned by this fake Eydis."
0,"But now that he knew the truth, he loathed his past self."
0,He was happy while the true Eydis suffered abuse at the hands of the one who shared in that happiness.
0,"The part of him that was happy in his ignorance was also happy that this Eydis was back and holding his hand, but that feeling filled his heart with anguish."
0,He wanted her to stay but also wanted her to leave and to never see her again.
0,She hurt the woman he loved.
0,She forced herself on him without a care for his feelings.
0,"If she had only given him the chance to tell her why he was so afraid, the trauma of his past… that he would hurt her too, he might have accepted whatever choice she made if she was willing to take the risk for Rynn’s sake."
0,"No, he knew she would have taken the risk anyway."
0,That much was obvious.
0,His own trauma was the only barrier stopping him from willingly consenting after Eydis explained that she needed sex to recover ven quickly.
0,"He was still angry, but he also felt guilty, part of him thinking that he was also at fault."
0,"All this confusion was because he knew deep down that despite what Eydis had done, she was not a bad person, just misguided, confused, and desperate."
0,This tumult of feelings made his head spin and tied his stomach in knots.
0,"He could not stand being in the same room as her, but not because he hated her."
0,He hated himself because part of him could not hate her.
0,"“You said that telling me about the minum was one of the reasons you came,” he said to distract himself from his own conflicting feelings."
0,“I assume Rynn is the other?”
0,Eydis exhaled weakly.
0,“Yes.
0,"I will take her with me, but I also wanted to heal you."
0,You got hurt protecting her.
0,I could not live with myself if I did nothing to thank you.”
0,She ran her hand over the burns on Justin’s arms and forehead.
0,"When she touched his cheek, her fingers lingered briefly past the ebbing of the sting."
0,Justin pulled away the blanket and turned his left leg towards Eydis.
0,She unbound it and eyed the burn with sorrow.
0,She ran her other hand over his leg.
0,Her face contorted in pain while she worked on the severe burn and soon had to stop to recover more ven before her pain grew unbearable.
0,"His skin healed and peeled, then healed and peeled again."
0,"After a second break to recover ven, Eydis slid her hand over his leg one final time."
0,"Fresh, pink, hairless skin that looked far healthier than the skin surrounding it covered his shin."
0,"“It should look like the rest of your leg in a few days, but I don’t know if the hair will grow back.”"
0,Justin was about to thank Eydis but stopped himself.
0,She did this to thank him or as an apology.
0,The awkward silence returned.
0,"Justin understood that Eydis would need to hold his hand longer to recover enough ven to leave, but he also knew there was more she wanted to say but was not saying it."
0,"Justin felt like he had to break the silence before it choked him, but he was saved by the rustling of a bed."
0,He pointed across the room.
0,Their talking woke Rynn.
0,"Her quivering mouth opened, but Eydis spoke a single word in Elven that made her cover her mouth."
0,She cried in silence.
0,Eydis walked over and hugged the young girl.
1,Justin was relieved to have a respite from interacting with Eydis.
0,He laid back in his bed while the two talked silently in Elven.
0,"He wanted to go back to sleep and let this dream or nightmare, which ever it was he was not sure, to end."
0,Only when Eydis sat back in the chair beside his bed did Justin reluctantly sit back up.
0,"Rynn sat in Eydis’s lap, and the difference in their height with Rynn wrapping her arms around Eydis made Rynn appear even younger."
0,"While in Eydis’s arms, Rynn did not exhibit the same fear of Justin she had before."
0,"“I know it is a little late for this, but let me finally introduce you to Rynn."
0,She is a Forest Elf and the youngest daughter of the Amelian Palace’s master chef.”
0,Eydis whispered something in Rynn’s ears.
0,"“Nais doo… meed… yuu,” Rynn repeated."
0,"Her pronunciation was terrible, but that only made Justin smile wider."
0,"Traditional Elven had no hard consonants, so the T’s might have been hard for her to pronounce."
0,"“Nice to meet you, too.” "
0,He searched his mind for an Elven greeting.
0,“Hanem-si-Justin-valeim.”
0,Eydis snickered.
0,“Too formal.
0,I did not know you spoke Elven.”
0,"Even though Eydis laughed at him, Justin did not mind."
0,“Eydis taught me a few basics but nothing more.
0,"If you don’t mind me asking, why did you warn me not to let anyone touch Rynn’s horns?"
0,Is there something dangerous about them?”
0,"Eydis’s fingers caressed the base of Rynn’s right horn, and Rynn quickly pulled Eydis’s hand away."
0,“The way a Forest Elf’s horn looks after it peels naturally is seen as beautiful.
0,Interfering with them while they peel can ruin the final appearance.
0,"She does not want anyone to touch them, and I also want her to grow into a beautiful adult."
0,"Once they finish peeling, she will be considered a fully grown adult woman in Forest Elf society."
0,She is two and a half years old.
0,"If I compare her to a human girl in this world’s years, she would be about thirteen or fourteen years old and the horns will finish peeling when she is fifteen or sixteen, maybe?"
0,"She’s actually older than me,” Eydis chuckled."
0,Sammy guessed that Rynn was twelve.
0,"With Rynn sitting in Eydis’s lap, Justin had the impression that she was closer to ten."
0,He never imagined that she was equivalent to a teenager.
0,“She will then be able to find herself a man and start a family.”
0,That last remark took Justin by surprise.
0,He had a bad feeling.
0,Eydis’s eyes glistened.
0,"“We plan on staying in this world, so Rynn will eventually choose a man from among the humans of this world."
0,"I have done too much that is… unforgivable, but Rynn is innocent of everything."
0,"I know you already have Sammy and Eydis, but once Rynn comes of age, I cannot think of a better man for her than you."
0,"You are not only kind, brave, and thoughtful, but you are also very accepting of our kind.”"
0,Justin was at a loss for words.
0,"“She is incredible with housework, has a water affinity which helps even more, and because she is the daughter of the master chef of the palace, she will be incredible at cooking, too, once she grows accustomed to the food of this world."
0,She is already very skilled with what supplies she had at that house.
0,"She also has a really long tail, but I guess you already saw it."
0,Do human males in this world even have tail preferences?
0,"And if you do not like the scar, I might be able to talk her into letting me heal it if it will give her a better chance at a happy life.”"
0,Eydis was like a mother trying to arrange a marriage for her beloved daughter.
0,Rynn on the other hand looked confused as she switched glances between Eydis and Justin.
0,It was clear to Justin that they had not discussed this beforehand and that Rynn had no idea what Eydis was talking to him about.
0,“Hold on.
0,Hold on.
0,You are moving way too fast.
0,"A year of age for elves is like ten or more for humans, right?"
0,That’s still a long way off.
0,And have you even talked with her about it?”
0,"“Elves mature faster when young, so she may be ready in four or five of your years."
0,"I know I might be rushing this, but I want what is best for her more than anything and everything."
0,I am begging you to please at least consider the possibility of taking her as one of your future wives.”
0,"Legality and social stigma against polygamy aside, Justin had long promised himself to never be in another relationship, and he felt even more committed to that promise knowing that he broke it by starting a relationship with the imposter of the woman he loved."
0,Now that same imposter was pushing Rynn on him.
0,How do I even respond?
0,Eydis did not wait for a reply.
0,She lifted Rynn off her and stood.
0,"Her formerly glowing face when talking about Rynn grew solemn, almost remorseful."
0,“I have said everything that I came here to say.
0,I will keep watch out for Jethro.”
0,Justin’s bed shook.
0,Eydis hunched over and used the bed as a support.
0,Sweat beaded and dripped from her face.
0,Rynn grew concerned and spoke some words in Elven.
0,"Once Justin was certain Eydis would collapse and almost reached over to grab her, she tore open a portal in the air at the end of Justin’s bed."
0,He could see the nearly empty hospital parking garage.
0,"After a few breaths, Eydis recovered, but the pain of creating the portal remained on Eydis’s already anguished face."
0,"“Making… a portal…for two… was harder than I… expected,” she said through haggard breaths."
0,Eydis righted herself but hesitated to walk through the portal.
0,Justin grew tired of her reservation.
0,“There is something else you want to say.
0,What is it?”
0,Eydis froze.
0,“Eydis.”
0,“Do you like my eyes?
0,"It is a bit tiring, but I am keeping them red."
0,"They are the only part of me that is different from Eydis, after all.”"
0,Justin grew annoyed.
0,That’s not it.
0,“And there is something else I regret.
0,I feel I need to confess it to finally have peace.
0,Tell the police to check the freezer in the basement of that house.”
0,Annoyance turned to anger.
0,That’s not it!
0,“You said that you did not want my apology.
0,You wanted an explanation.
0,"Now that I have told you everything, I can finally say this.” Eydis gripped her hand over her heart and bowed herself low enough that her forehead touched Justin’s feet."
0,"“I am so, so sorry for everything I have done to you and Eydis and everyone.”"
0,"Justin thought that her apology might have been the source of her reservation, but when Eydis raised her head, an even greater sadness and deeper darkness lingered."
0,He wanted to tell her to speak her mind.
0,I told you to talk to me…
0,Eydis forced a smile.
0,“Goodbye…”
1,Eydis walked through the portal with Rynn and closed it behind her.
0,She ached from the void in her heart.
0,The emotional pain was more agonizing than her ven poisoning.
0,She wanted to beg Justin to let her stay.
0,She wanted him to tell her not to go.
0,"But, she knew that would never happen."
0,"It could not happen, and she knew she had no right to ask that of him."
0,Eydis fell to her knees and cried.
1,"* * *
Fect stood in a chair set at the head of a large table of a meeting room on the second floor of the palace."
0,Dim morning light glistened between the half-drawn curtains of the crystalline windows.
0,Flecks of rainbow danced on a large fabric map pinned in the corners of the table by four knives.
0,The map depicted the city of the other world to the best detail that Fect could remember.
0,Fect did not draw the map himself.
0,The work was done by a professional High Elf cartographer under Fect’s direction.
0,Those attending the strategy meeting marveled at the detail produced in less than a day by a craftsman who had spent many times the lifespan of a human to perfect his craft.
0,"In attendance were Jethro, Fect, and five veteran generals nearing or past retirement who volunteered for what they believed may be their last mission: General Vard, a noble-born human; General Hattn, an eleventh-generation human military officer; General Makstev, a dwarf who worked his way up from a nameless foot soldier; General Teppo, a minum and magical prodigy; and General Oyak, a fifth-generation human military officer and the only female officer in Tolmyur."
0,Jethro placed his hand on Fect’s shoulder.
0,“Let us begin.”
0,Fect jumped onto the table and walked across the large map on his bare feet.
0,"He held a black, red, and blue stone in his hand."
0,"One by one, he drew three X marks on the map with the powdery blue stone."
0,The first was located further north of the city.
0,The second was on the road leading up the mountains to the east.
0,The final mark was in the forest on the southeast edge of the city.
0,“These are the three teleportation coordinates that Jethro has memorized.”
0,Angry voices whispered to each other due to the informal way Fect referred to their Commanding General.
0,Fect did not hold a military rank and was no more than an expendable foot soldier who was attending the meeting only to relay information.
0,Jethro raised his hands to silence the room.
0,"Unfazed, Fect continued."
0,"“As you can see, these three locations are on the east side of the river bisecting the city."
0,The highest probability is that our target is located here.”
0,Fect walked over to the other side of the map and thrust down a very thin dagger designed for use as a marker for locations of importance on maps.
0,The dagger was sharp at the tip but rounded on the edge.
0,On the small spherical pommel was etched a symbol meaning “primary.”
0,“And that is?” 
0,"“A medical facility, General Makstev.” "
0,The dwarven general stroked his beard.
0,“And you are certain that the princess will be there?”
0,“It is the most probable location.
0,"To my knowledge, this is the only medical facility in the city."
0,The size would suggest there is no need for another and that it services other regions outside the city as well.
0,The population of the city is not so ill that it would warrant a medical facility of that size.
0,The doppelganger that Jethro sent over succeeded in severely weakening our target.
0,"To my eyes, she was no different than a corpse."
0,"She was given into the hands of the humans, and the medical capabilities of that world are very limited, much like our own back in Tolmyur."
0,I expect her to be there recovering for a prolonged time.”
0,"“If the princess was before you, why did you not capture her?!”"
0,Accusatory voices sounded around the table.
0,"“With all due respect, General Teppo, I tried."
0,"Even with your three elemental affinities, how would you fare in combat against a doppelganger of the genius princess who is capable of using magic taught her by Jethro while simultaneously trying to take that Lurr’s prey?”"
0,The minum grew silent as did the other generals.
0,“And the other possible locations?” General Oyak asked.
0,Fect stabbed another dagger into the center of a complex of large and spaced structures.
0,The symbol on the pommel read “secondary”.
0,“This is an educational complex.
0,The princess worked as an instructor here and taught both combat and possibly magic.
0,"If she has recovered, we may find her there."
0,The final location is more troublesome.”
0,Fect grabbed five daggers that read “tertiary” from the side of the table and thrust them into locations along the river.
0,"“When I was secretly monitoring the doppelganger’s movements while she was working with us, I heard from her discussions with Austin that the princess lived with a man along the river, but I never discovered where."
0,"She ignored orders and teleported around the city, so I could not follow her."
0,These five daggers represent the five residential districts bordering the river.
0,Four of them are quite large.”
0,“Then the plan is to send our strongest forces to the medical facility and a secondary force to the school.
0,We can then handle the residential districts the same as we did here in Amel and the early fairy cities.”
0,Fect shook his head.
0,“Jethro is unable to do that.”
0,“Who are you to say what is and is not possible for our Great Commanding General!
0,"Know your place!” General Makstev drew his sword, and angry voices berated Fect."
0,Jethro raised his hand once more to silence the generals.
0,“Fect is correct.
0,I was personally involved with the Amel invasion and many of the fairy cities at the beginning of the Vallen campaign.
0,"However, I cannot accurately send someone to a location unless I have personally been there or have otherwise seen it."
0,Take a look at this.”
0,Jethro removed a sheet of parchment from his robe and slid it across the table.
0,The generals were amazed by not only the quality of the parchment but also the painting on it.
0,The face looked nearly identical to Jethro with other smaller faces on the bottom displaying modified hairstyles and beards.
0,“Fect returned with this from his latest mission.
0,The city knows who I am.
0,"If I go to that world to assess the precise locations to teleport our soldiers, I would likely be spotted."
0,The city would go on high alert and the princess would be hidden or removed.
0,"The matter could change if I arrive with you in the city and then sent you from there, but for now, that is not possible.”"
0,"“So, my Lord will not be taking part in the siege?” "
0,"“No, General Hattn.” "
0,"The generals grew silent, so Fect continued the meeting."
0,"“Because our three known teleportation locations are on one side of the river and there are only three bridges across the river to our primary and secondary targets, our movements from that side are limited."
0,"With Jethro’s help, I will find two more locations on the other side of the city for us to use."
0,"Due to randomization, I cannot tell you the exact location these coordinates will be, but we will try to set them here and here.”"
0,Fect drew two large circles with the blue stone in the northwest and southwest.
0,There were five generals and five locations marked in blue.
0,The generals quickly understood the plan.
0,Fect then drew four X’s on the map using black charcoal.
0,“These are the tallest buildings in the city.
0,"No matter where you are, you can see them and use them to orient yourself."
0,"As you can see, the topmost building is at the educational complex, making it easy to locate.”"
0,“What of the city’s forces?
0,Do we know a number or makeup?”
0,Fect removed a string with a loop tied on one end and then tied the other end to the waxy red stone.
0,“We cannot use our concept of military and force when thinking about this world.
0,"From what I have seen, they are few in number but are individually powerful."
0,This is mainly due to their weaponry.”
0,"Jethro produced the small handgun and set it on the table while Fect explained the fighting strength of the weaponry he saw as well as the weakness to fire that all the carriages had, including those used by the military."
0,"“Due to their small numbers and lack of organized patrols within the city, there is a delay in their response."
0,"I can only estimate this time from the speed I have seen their carriages move on their fastest highways, but it gives us a range of action something like this.”"
0,Fect looped the string around the handle of the dagger pinned into the medical facility.
0,He then wound the string around the red stone until it held the proper length and drew a large red arc.
0,The wax slid smoothly along the fabric to create a distinct line.
0,"“From the time I first attacked someone at the medical facility until the large majority of city guards arrived, I would place their initial location somewhere near the edge of this circle.”"
0,Fect then repeated drawing another large arc in the southeast side of the city using a longer string length.
0,"“When I attacked here, the response time was longer, making me think the large part of their force was about this far away.”"
0,There was a location where both arcs neared each other.
0,Fect pinned a dagger with a red pommel at that spot.
0,"“Two reference points are not enough to be certain, but if I had to guess, the main body of the city guard is stationed somewhere near here."
0,"As you can see, it is closer to the medical complex than the educational complex or river.”"
0,"“In all your time in that world, you were unable to locate the headquarters of the city guard?"
0,"What was the scout team doing,” General Vard asked, rather exasperated."
0,"“I saw their distinct carriages from time to time, but I had no idea those were guards and did not learn until my escape from the medical facility."
0,The culture of the other world is far too different from ours.”
0,"“Now that you know, can you remember any location where these carriages were stored?” General Makstev followed."
0,“It would be quite substantial to hold the numbers stated in your reports.”
0,"“Most of the buildings are large, and the city has both aboveground and underground mass storage locations for their carriages."
0,"I never saw one with the police carriages inside, so its entrance must be sealed or secluded.” "
0,"“If the general public had access to them, that would be problematic for the guard,” General Vard thought vocally."
0,“I understand.”
0,"“Then this ends my briefing of the other world, but I am able to answer any further questions you have.” "
0,Fect walked off the table and sat back down at the head while Jethro stood beside him.
0,"This unnerved the generals, but they continued the strategy meeting in a professional manner."
0,"The planning took most of the day, and Fect was thoroughly exhausted by its conclusion."
1,Jethro dismissed the generals and left the room with Fect.
0,He looked down at Fect and saw him shaking.
0,“A bit much for you?”
0,“No sir.
0,"I am just not used to it,” Fect replied honestly."
0,“You should know that their outward hostility towards you was all an act.
0,You did well not to lose face or yield to them.
0,They will remember your composure and be more accepting of you.
0,And you will become more accustomed to these sorts once your promotion to Captain becomes finalized.
0,"I would have liked to give you a higher position for the work you have accomplished, but I need you to stay active in the field and behind enemy lines, at least for now.”"
0,“No. It is an honor I am unworthy of.
0,How long until you know if you can join us in the siege?”
0,“That depends on Emer.
0,Inverting the coordinates of the origin and destination is far more complicated than just swapping the two.
0,It is more akin to turning a person inside out and expecting them to continue living as if nothing changed.
0,"Creating a new formula from the destination to return to the origin is far easier, but we still do not know where our world is in relation to that one, so that option is impossible."
0,I cannot go to another world until I am certain I can return this time.”
0,“Why not wait until Emer finishes?” 
0,“Why would you think not waiting is best?” 
0,Fect stopped walking to think.
0,"Having come to an answer, he continued after Jethro."
0,“We do not know when the princess will recover or if they will move her out of the city.
0,The sooner we act the better.”
0,“Precisely.” 
0,“Is there anything you need me to do in preparation for my mission?”
0,“I trust you enough to be able to prepare what is needed.
0,However…” Jethro gazed out the window at the palace courtyard and Temple of the Gods glistening golden red in the sunset.
0,"“If you feel you need assistance, talk with Penk and get him up to speed."
0,"If he can learn everything about the other world as well as you know it, feel free to take him with as security."
0,I cannot risk losing someone of your potential.
0,It will take me two days to prepare the soldiers.
0,You have until then.”
0,"Chapter 16
“Invasion”"
1,“You can’t stay cooped up in here forever.” 
0,Justin sat in a chair next to Eydis’s bed with a textbook in his hands and a notebook lying on the bed next to him.
0,The bags under his eye were the telling signs that he had been forgoing sleep.
0,“I want to be here when Eydis wakes up.”
0,Sammy folded her arms and looked up at Sean and Miriam to say something as well.
0,"“Besides, this is the only place that the reporters won’t bother me.”"
0,Rumors about Eydis being involved in something dangerous had spread around the university to the point that it became common knowledge to all the students.
0,"When Eydis appeared on the news for a few seconds before the feed cut, gossip among the students exploded."
0,"The news footage was seen by everyone within two days, and despite the police’s attempts to keep witnesses quiet, Justin’s involvement in the standoff and the fires in the southeast edge of town where Eydis was reportedly seen had reached the various news outlets."
0,"Everyone wanted to know who Eydis and the demon girl were, how Justin was involved, and what actually happened that made the police and military want to silence it so desperately."
0,"After a leak by the nurses that the demon girl disappeared mysteriously at night without the guards or Justin knowing, the press was in full force."
0,"They waited at the university for Justin to arrive, and some even found his address."
0,"Sammy, Chloe, Miriam, and Sean were accosted by the press at first, but once they explained that they were not involved in the incident and only knew what the news and police had already reported, they left them alone."
0,Only occasionally would someone new approach them and ask a few questions about Justin and Eydis.
0,“You will have to leave eventually.
0,I can stay and watch Eydis too.
0,"You don’t need to shoulder everything yourself,” Sammy said."
0,“But she’s like this because of me.”
0,Because I didn’t recognize that other Eydis was a fake.
0,"“He will need to leave soon anyway,” Sean said."
0,“He has a final in two hours.”
0,“Two hours?” 
0,Justin looked up at the clock across the room.
0,He had lost track of time.
0,“That settles it.” Sammy pulled Justin up by his arm.
0,“Sean I am borrowing your car.
0,Can you and Miriam watch over Eydis?”
0,"“Of course,” Miriam replied, elated."
0,"“And I know there are extra beds in here, but try to keep control of yourselves."
0,You don’t know when a nurse might pop in.”
0,“Was that supposed to be a joke?
0,Who do you take me for?” 
0,Sean shook his head lightly as he tossed Sammy his car key.
0,Miriam only smiled and waved off Sammy and Justin.
1,Justin raised the hood of his hoodie and tightened the strings to conceal most of his face.
0,"It was a hot April day, and Sammy knew he would be sweltering in his thick hoodie."
0,She only wore a single layer.
0,"Like her, Justin always felt warmer than most."
0,The hospital gave him permission to use a service exit instead of the main entrance to avoid any press who might be lurking around the hospital.
0,"He stayed silent during the drive over to the university, and they arrived with an hour and a half to spare."
0,"“I didn’t need to arrive this early,” Justin complained."
0,"“Yes you did,” Sammy shot back."
0,"Justin expected that Sammy wanted to account for possible students and reporters who might spot him, but that was not the case."
0,The campus had few students wandering the pathways due to finals week in session.
0,"Sammy skillfully led Justin around less used routes, and they only crossed one student."
0,"Sammy held a finger to her mouth, and the girl nodded and acted like she never saw Justin or Sammy."
1,Sammy led Justin into a building on the older side of campus and up a floor to a rarely traversed foyer.
0,“Wait here.”
0,Sammy ran off down the hallway.
0,"Justin hunched over on the couch to hide his face from anyone who might walk by, but he was sure no one would."
0,"It was a foyer that he and Sammy knew well, the same foyer where they first met."
0,"This was also the foyer where he instructed Eydis to wait after her first English class at the university, where Eydis also first met Sammy."
0,"Ten minutes later, Sammy returned with two cups of coffee and handed the larger of the two to Justin."
0,“There are a couple more shots of espresso in it.
0,Take this hour to relax and wake up so you don’t fail your test.
0,"I know it will be hard, but I forbid you to think about Eydis until your final is over."
0,"This is your only final because your other was a paper, right?"
0,"And knowing you, you probably need to get at least a B on it to pass the class.”"
0,“B-minus.” 
0,“See? So take a deep breath and caffeinate yourself.”
0,Justin took a sip of the coffee.
0,It was a tad too bitter.
0,"Sammy tended to be a little abrasive, but she was soft-hearted and had always been rather considerate when needed."
0,Times like today made Justin miss the year they had been dating.
0,“I know you already have others like Sammy.”
0,Had… Justin corrected the fake Eydis in his mind.
0,Sammy backhanded Justin’s arm.
0,“You were thinking about Eydis just then.
0,Stop.
0,"If you need to take a quick caffeine nap to clear your mind, I can wake you up in a half hour."
0,Feel free to use my lap if you need to.”
0,Justin downed half the cup and set it on the floor.
0,"“A nap is probably a good idea, but please spare me having to use your lap.”"
0,Justin slouched down in the couch so that he could rest his head against the back cushion.
0,"Once his eyes were closed, he fell asleep before even realizing it."
0,“Wake up.
0,You have fifteen minutes before you need to be in line for your test.” Sammy pulled Justin up off the couch.
0,"Once he stood, the sleep left him rather quickly."
0,He felt like he had a bit more energy.
0,"“Caffeine nap, huh?”"
1,Justin followed Sammy to the testing center.
0,"There were plenty of students in line who shot glances and tried to strike conversation, but he ignored them."
0,"Once inside the door, no one could bother him."
0,Sammy sat on one of the many benches outside and waited.
0,"After two hours passed, Sammy received a phone call from Dr. Shuman."
0,She looked to the northeast and saw whiffs of smoke.
0,Their greatest fear had become a reality.
1,"* * *
Jethro walked down the central hallway of the Amelian Palace beside Emer and Keeya with an entourage of over two hundred High Elves following behind him."
0,The grand palace door opened to a crowd of soldiers standing in rank and file below the steps.
0,An eerie silence enveloped the crowd.
0,"For such a large gathering, the breaths or coughs of the few should have been audible."
0,The small shifts in position should have created sound as the soldier’s armor rubbed.
0,"But no, despite the one thousand soldiers packed together on the proportionately narrow walkway of the palace’s main courtyard, not a sound was made."
0,Five generals stood at the top of the steps beside an elevated platform.
0,General Makstev saluted Jethro and approached.
0,“The men have been briefed on their missions with their individual roles explained by their generals before assembling.
0,Many of them are still nervous due to being sent to an unknown world.
0,A few words of encouragement from you should ease them.”
0,“I know my soldiers’ mettle.
0,What you see as nerves is only the excitement of war.
0,"Besides, I have never been one to speak before crowds."
0,I trust your words were sufficient.
0,Your ability to rally the soldiers is why I have given you command of the largest platoon and the key role of the siege.”
0,"“Yes, sir."
0,I am honored to lay down my life for our cause.”
0,“Do not go assuming you will die yet.” 
0,"If even General Makstev believed he would die, perhaps the soldiers truly were nervous."
0,Jethro reconsidered.
0,“A word will not hurt.”
0,"Jethro stepped up onto the platform, and General Teppo stood beside him to broadcast Jethro’s voice using wind magic."
0,"The army of one thousand included several of his army’s most skilled magicians and fighters pulled from their former positions in the occupation of Amel, the campaign against the fairies in Vallen, and even from back in Tolmyur."
0,Jethro created this very small but powerful force because he could not risk failure here.
0,“Grand soldiers of our proud Tolmyur Kingdom!
0,"The mission you are about to undertake is of the greatest importance in our destruction of our eternal enemy, the Amelian Empire."
0,The Tyrant Princess has fled to a new world where she believed we could not reach her.
0,Now she is hiding within the protection of the humans of that world.
0,"Yes, your enemies today are your fellow brothers and sisters, but they have been corrupted by the lies of the elves, the same lies that labeled us as enemies of our world."
0,Make no mistake; the humans of that world will try with all their might to kill you.
0,"Do not feel remorse, give them no quarter, and return with Princess Eydis FeAmel so that she can pay for her crimes and the crimes of her empire!”"
0,Shouts echoed like the beat of a drum.
0,Jethro’s words marked the beginning of a battle that bridged worlds.
0,“As masterful as to be expected of our Great Commanding General.” General Makstev and the other four generals genuflected with their left fist thrust at the ground beside them and their right fist across their chest.
0,It was not a salute but a posture used by military to show reverence to the king.
0,"For a military officer to perform such an act to one other than the King of Tolmyur was the highest form of treason, but for Jethro it was the highest form of respect."
0,"To many, Jethro was their king."
0,Jethro brought Emer to the head of the steps and called General Makstev.
0,“Bring your troops.
0,The mission starts now.”
0,"General Makstev raised his sword, and 500 of the soldiers advanced up the steps."
0,A High Elf from Jethro’s entourage placed his hand on Keeya’s back.
0,"Other High Elves grasped the arms of the first High Elf, and the elves behind grasped the arms of the ones before."
0,"All the High Elves’ ven connected through each other to Emer while the kissiae shaman, Keeya, acted as a filter to prevent any intended harm to Emer from the comparatively weaker life magic of the High Elves."
0,The army of five hundred arrived at the top of the steps with General Makstev at the head.
0,“To victory!”
0,"Jethro surrounded General Makstev with a barrier, and Emer sent the general to the other world."
1,"* * *
General Makstev stepped off the empty cement foundation of what had once been a house used as a base for Jethro’s men."
0,"Behind him, soldiers appeared in a flash of light one by one."
0,“Keep moving and do not hesitate.
0,"If you remain at the portal exit, you will die when the next soldier arrives.”"
0,A lieutenant remained at the exit to give instructions to the soldiers as they arrived and move them forward.
0,Makstev continued walking along the gravel road leading away from the house.
0,He could see the large city in the distance without a wall.
0,There were no towers or any external fortifications visible on the perimeter.
0,“Pure foolishness.
0,This is no siege.
0,Their lack of preparation will be their undoing.”
0,The sky spread clear and blue and a faint chill from the mountains followed the wind over the plains to ease the mild heat of the sun.
0,“Even the Gods of this world have given favor to our battle.”
0,Makstev turned to watch the remaining soldiers arrive.
0,"They stood in rank and file at the front of the property, fifty to a squad and ten squads in total."
0,Each squad was led by a lieutenant for individual action when needed.
0,No captains were present whose role would have been to lead the men into battle while the general strategized and controlled from the rear.
0,This was an unknown world with many unknown dangers.
0,"His final task was to lead them through the unknown as one of the most senior and seasoned of all Tolmyur, to fight and die with them."
0,He was proud of his men.
0,They did not show fear or surprise at the unfamiliar view before them.
0,Their faces were hardened.
0,“To our deaths!
0,March!”
0,"Jethro had expressed his confidence in Makstev’s ability to not only provide for their victory but also survive; however, Makstev knew the truth of the mission given to him and his men."
0,"In a battle where the strength of their opponent was still not fully measured, they were the sacrifices, decoys to lead the way for the other generals to fulfil their mission of finding and capturing the Tyrant Princess."
0,The army of five hundred marched at full pace.
0,Hiding was impossible among the fields.
0,The enemy would see their advance.
0,Show us what power your city holds.
0,Meet us in honorable battle!
1,What met General Makstev was not an army.
0,“Do they mock us?”
0,The march halted still distant from the edge of the city.
0,On the road ahead sat three of the armored carriages Fect had mentioned in the briefing.
0,No more than twenty men in speckled tan and black uniforms stood guard.
0,“No armor but helmets and fabric.
0,There is no honor in this.”
0,"To Makstev, this would be another massacre like all the others."
0,"For those who thirsted for battle, the Amelian Empire had fallen too easily."
0,But he still had a mission to perform.
0,Makstev faced his army.
0,“This city underestimates us!
0,Show them true fear!
0,The princess is ours for the taking!”
0,"The thundering chord of gauntlet, spear, and shield sounded from the army, and the humans of the city responded not with weapons but with sound."
0,"A voice echoed over the field, but neither Makstev nor his men could understand it."
0,“Earth mages to the vanguard!
0,Raise the walls!”
0,"A line of minums, dwarves, and a few humans marched to the front."
0,They thrust their hand onto the ground in perfect unison and raised a wall of hardened earth that covered the entire breadth of the army.
0,“March!”
0,The line of earth mages split into two alternating groups.
0,Every other mage sustained and hardened the earthen wall while the next pushed it forward.
0,"“Archers, ready!"
0,Fire!”
0,"A volley of arrows flew into the sky from the back lines, but they far over-shot their targets."
0,“Adjust aim!
0,Arrows carry further in this world!”
0,"Under the direction of their lieutenants, second and third volleys were fired."
0,Rapid cracks and popping reached Makstev’s ears.
0,A minum signaler at the front signed that the wall was being attacked but the damage was insignificant.
0,"The information on this world’s weaponry from the new minum captain was indeed vital, and Makstev began to understand why the Commanding General thought so highly of the boy."
0,The small projectiles fired from this world’s weaponry could not penetrate the thick wall of earth.
0,This mobile wall was the boy’s machination.
0,Earth mages were often employed for defensive walls in battle but never on this scale and never to lead a charge offensively.
0,This was a mark of genius.
0,“Your weapons mean nothing.
0,Mourn your misfortune of being born without magic.”
0,A faint white smoke wafted over the walls.
0,The signaler coughed and shielded his eyes.
0,The earth mages soon showed similar symptoms.
0,A burning object spewing smoke flew over the wall and landed near the front lines.
0,A second followed.
0,Any who ingested the smoke likewise fell into a fit of coughing.
0,The smoke was a heavy irritant.
0,“Clear the air quickly before it spreads!”
0,The few wind mages at Makstev’s command blew the smoke upward and away from his soldiers while the nearby earth mages buried the small sources of the smoke deep in the ground.
0,"Captain Fect never mentioned smoke weaponry, but he expected his knowledge to be incomplete."
0,It was only one of the many unknowns he knew he would encounter.
0,"In a world without magic, perhaps smoke weaponry might be effective, but such weak tactics served no greater purpose than to inconvenience his men."
0,"His men recovered their composure quickly, showing it was not toxic."
0,A signaler on the wall unaffected by the smoke held up his hand and signed that the enemy was retreating.
1,“March! Double speed!”
0,"The earthen walls thinned for ease of movement, and the soldiers picked up pace."
0,"The speed prevented the archers from volleying their arrows, but they were now in range of the first structures."
0,Arrows were useless against brick and stone.
0,“Fire mages!
0,Draw those cowards out!”
0,Countless fireballs soared through the air and over the wall in trails of grey smoke.
0,Buildings burst into flame.
0,The screams of the populace wailed from the city.
0,"Jethro, in his wisdom, placed the greatest number and most skilled fire mages under Makstev’s command."
0,Widespread destruction would draw the enemy from wherever they hid if they wanted to save their city from crumbling into a ruin of char and ash.
0,The Minum raised his hand and signaled.
0,"Enemy reinforcements, double the number."
0,“Still too few.”
0,The army’s advance reached the first enflamed buildings.
0,Makstev was confident that no enemy could be hiding in them.
0,"The walls became a hindrance in the narrow streets, but they had fulfilled their purpose in helping the army approach the city unharmed."
0,“We have reached the city!
0,Remember the words of your Great Commanding General!
0,Show no mercy!
0,Draw these cowards out of hiding.”
0,A small object flew over the wall and landed in the center of a squad.
0,The resulting explosion killed or injured a fifth of the squad.
0,Two more similar objects flew into the soldiers with the same destructive force.
0,“Wind mages!
0,Send them back!”
0,"Although Makstev gave the order, no more objects flew over."
0,"Instead, the minum signaled that the enemy was retreating."
0,"From what General Makstev could see, about ten of his men had died with many more severely wounded, but no deaths were confirmed yet from the enemy."
0,Their opponent did have power.
0,“Hahaha!
0,Much better!
0,Now we have a fight!
0,Listen to your lieutenants.
0,Purge the streets!”
0,Fire mages rained a large barrage of explosive fire over the wall to create suppressive cover for the earth mages to drop the walls.
0,The soldiers flooded unhindered into the streets and alleys killing all in sight.
1,"* * *
“That was the eighth carriage to leave."
0,How many do we wait for?” Penk asked Fect.
0,“We no longer wait.
0,General Makstev is attacking.
0,We must cut off their communication before the other generals arrive.”
0,Fect and Penk monitored what they believed to be the station of the city guard.
0,"Jethro sent them a day early to scout it out, and as Fect predicted, it was located not much further north from his estimation."
0,He expected their mission to involve eliminating the enemy’s commander before they could gather forced and retaliate but was surprised when Jethro gave a different goal.
0,"With the technological advancement of this world, the city guard could communicate orders to their forces and quickly respond to threats across the city; a tactic of which Jethro’s army was incapable."
0,"Having seen the power of the communication devices and how rapidly the city guard responded when Fect escaped the medical facility, he understood the importance of this mission far more than Penk."
0,Information was the greatest weapon in war.
0,The two minums activated their invisibility magic and split up.
0,"Penk headed to what they assumed was the headquarters or administration building, and Fect targeted what he believed to be the underground storage location for the carriages."
0,Penk waited by an entryway for someone to either enter or exit the locked backdoor.
0,"It opened, and a hurried guard ran out, across the paved lot, and past Fect to the carriage storage."
0,"Once Fect was sure Penk entered, he followed the former guard."
1,The stable for the carriages was just as Fect expected.
0,"The entrance was small, but once inside, it grew larger than the lot above it."
0,"Although he thought it a stable, a dock would be a more accurate label."
0,The machines were evenly spaced along the cement walls like boats at port.
0,"Three thick-armored carriages were parked near the back, and about ten to fifteen of the carriages with the red and blue flares affixed on top, their lights dead, were scattered among the remaining lots."
0,Fect waited to give time for Penk to begin his attack.
0,He did not want the dock swarmed with guards.
0,"Once enough time passed, he conjured pillars of fire from beneath the three armored carriages."
0,They exploded in a grand fireball.
0,"One by one, he continued with the other carriages."
0,"Two city guards appeared from a door to the horror of their vehicles’ destruction, and Fect engulfed them in fire before running through the door."
0,This was far too easy.
0,A guard with his handgun drawn in the narrow hallway noticed the blur of Fect’s invisibility magic in motion and fired.
0,Fect anticipated the attack and dropped to the ground.
0,"An intense and concentrated ray of heat shot from his eyes into the guard’s eye, roasting the inside of the guard’s head instantly."
0,"The guard collapsed, liquid fat and mucus draining from his nose and mouth."
0,Only two more guards remained in the structure holed up defensively in one of the back rooms.
0,Fect eliminated them without issue by setting the entire room on fire and ran for the headquarters.
0,He trusted that Penk had already finished.
0,Penk specialized in silent anti-personnel magic that became even stronger inside structures and other enclosed spaces.
1,"A small fireball blew out the back door to the headquarters, and Fect rushed in."
0,He ran past two dead bodies and entered a large open office.
0,There was no sign of Penk--he already moved on to the upper floors--but the aftermath of his magic permeated the office.
0,"Fect used wind magic to filter out the immense humidity near his head in order to breathe, and if not for his fire affinity, the heat of the air would have killed him near-instantly."
0,The skin of the people on the ground boiled and peeled right off their bodies.
0,"Everything that could not stand the heat and moisture dissolved and crumbled, including the wall coating and ceiling tiles."
0,"Penk was first and foremost a water mage, but he further increased its power with his aptitude for fire magic."
0,This was a level of silent lethality that Fect felt he could never match.
0,Fect ran for the stairwell door that had been blown open.
0,The second floor was in a similar state to the first.
0,One man clung to life and tried to crawl for the stairwell.
0,His eyes boiled and spewed out diluted blood.
0,Fect stabbed the man in the heart through his back to prevent him from sending out an alarm even if the probability of doing so was low.
0,He continued to the third floor where he found Penk standing over a body in one of the smaller offices.
0,"“From the difference in his badge, I would say he was the Captain of the Guard."
0,Mission complete.” Penk handed Fect the badge that read Major P. Wickenny.
0,“This should slow any response time against the remaining generals.
0,"Now we must determine if the princess is still at the medical facility,” Fect ordered."
0,"“If she is not, we will send up the signal.”"
1,Fect and Penk ran down the stairs and out of the station with their invisibility magic leaving a blurred outline around them.
0,A hand faster than Fect could see grabbed Penk’s head from behind and ground it into the paved walkway as the hand’s owner slid to a stop.
0,The High Elf looked at the red line of gore that was once half of Penk’s face.
0,She then lifted and inspected the intact side of Penk’s head.
0,“Not the one I was hoping to kill.”
0,Fect stared in horror at the red-eyed monster before him.
1,"* * *
General Makstev’s assault on the northern side of the city began effecting the citizens."
0,"The city was large, so much of the population was unaware of the dangers at first, but there were some who leaned on the side of caution, having seen the smoke rising from the northeast, and decided to evacuate, or at least travel to the Gullivan City Viewpoint in the mountains where they could better see what was happening."
0,The road to the east up the mountain gradually increased in traffic.
0,"In a flash of light, an elderly woman with waist-length, silver hair tied back in a ponytail and wearing a studded leather tunic appeared on the mountain road."
0,A horn from an approaching metal carriage blared.
0,"With a step to the side and a twist of her waist, General Oyak drew her bow with her shaking left arm and fired a wind-enhanced arrow at the side window of the carriage as it passed by close enough for her to feel the draft."
0,The arrow broke through the window unobstructed and passed through the heads of both driver and passenger.
0,The carriage swerved and collided with a metal railing bordering the mountain’s slope on the side of the road.
0,Oyak removed two arrows from the left quiver on her hip and fired them in quick succession at two more oncoming carriages.
0,Each arrow broke through the glass with the aid of wind magic and hit their mark.
0,"The first carriage continued forward past Oyak, but the second swerved to the left and collided with another."
0,The clash of grinding metal roared from behind.
0,"The carriage that had passed her collided with a much larger carriage, or perhaps what may be considered a wagon in this world."
0,The large vehicle jackknifed and slid downhill perpendicular to the road.
0,She ran at the vehicle and slid feet first underneath.
0,"The large vehicle tipped over and stopped, blocking both lanes of the roadway."
0,No more traffic approached from either direction.
0,Panicked people left their vehicles and ran towards the wreckage to aid those caught in it.
0,"Oyak staggered in her gait as she returned to the location the transmission sent her, making sure to stay a few feet clear."
0,One concerned man called out to Oyak.
0,"She drew her bow to kill him, but a white flash of light blew away half the man in an explosion of gore."
0,A bearded giant wearing thin plated chainmail and brandishing a halberd stood in his place.
0,Those who witnessed the gruesome scene fled screaming.
0,"“Lieutenant Borgrum, move from that spot unless you want to become like him."
0,Make certain the others who appear do so as well.”
0,General Oyak walked over to the large metal crate of the wagon and used wind magic to lift herself on top.
0,She looked down at the bizarre yet beautiful city that glimmered in the sunlight and at the smoke rising from the northeast side of the city.
0,“Tis a pity that this great land has fallen prey to the Tyrant Princess’s deceit.
0,I wonder if they can still be saved.” She looked back at her arriving soldiers.
0,"“No, the city will be lost."
0,The greatest salvation we can give the humans of this world is to quell the elven corruption here before it can spread.”
0,The small force of fifty soldiers finished gathering.
0,General Oyak once again used wind magic to aid her aged body in jumping down from the metal crate.
0,"When she landed, her head grew faint, and she fell backwards."
0,A large hand supported her back and helped her stand.
0,"“Thank you, Lieutenant Borgrum."
0,The air is far too thin here.”
0,“Do not force yourself.
0,You are nearing six years old.
0,I should have been the one to clear the exit.”
0,"“As strong as you are, you could not have stopped these carriages without magic."
0,My health matters little.
0,"So long as our mission is accomplished, our lives are but a small price to pay.”"
0,Oyak faced her single squad of soldiers made primarily of human elemental archers and giant spearmen wielding square tower shields the size of a full-grown man.
0,“We march!
0,"By our Great Commanding General’s orders, kill all those in your path!"
0,Purge this city!”

One-hundred and forty-eight soldiers stood on an evacuated road on the northwest side of the city."
0,Demolished vehicles and dead bodies littered the ground.
0,The destruction happened in an instant.
0,"General Teppo and his men had appeared within the city on an intersection of two large roads only a short distance from the northernmost tower located at his target, the school."
0,Only two of their men were lost from collision with the metal carriages.
0,“We have been blessed by our Great Commanding General!
0,Only kill those who oppose us until we reach the school!
0,We march for the tower!”
1,"* * *
General Hattn viewed his surroundings, slightly awestruck by the peculiar architecture."
0,"Vast warehouses filled with wood, metal, and many unknown items and material surrounded them on all sides."
0,This warehouse district was vastly different than the structures towering in the distance.
0,"The map of the city drawn from the young Minum’s memory was surprisingly accurate, at least to the positions of the towering structures."
0,"He and his 250 men had appeared on the southwest edge of the city, and the tall buildings, which he had originally assumed to be watchtowers due to the young captain’s description of their height, stretched as if reaching the sky in the exact positions his mental map had set them."
0,The tallest of the structures even put the Amelian Palace to shame.
0,Hattn could see the smoke from General Makstev’s assault on the other side of the city.
0,He wished that he had been given the role of leading the assault.
0,"Having come from a long line of generals, he thirsted for the glory that would come from dying in battle in a foreign world; however, he also knew that no one else could perform the vital role that his Commanding General entrusted him."
0,"He was provided the second largest army and was given the task of searching the primary location, the medical facility."
0,He and his men could not afford to lose their lives.
0,Searching for the princess required him and his men to live while becoming a distraction required General Makstev and his men to die.
0,Hattn turned to his men who had just finished exiting the portal and now stood in formation.
0,“We have received the choice position from our Great Commanding General!
0,We march for the medical facility!
0,"Earth mages, break up all streets as we march!"
0,We cannot let them flee with the Tyrant Princess!”
1,The soldiers marched at a jogging pace through the warehouse complex and onto the open road.
0,Any vehicles that approached were flung to the side by earth mages upheaving the pavement or detonated by fire mages igniting the combustible fuel inside the carriages.
0,"All the civilians who saw the carnage fled for cover, except one."
0,Hattn saw one man kneeling on the ground in shock.
0,"In front of him, a tossed vehicle sat inverted with a large slab of pavement crushing it into the ground."
0,Beneath the pavement and metal was a woman.
0,"Hattn ignored the civilian, but in the man’s anger, he removed an object from his hip."
0,"Multiple loud pops echoed out, and Hattn watched six of his men crumble to the ground."
0,The civilians were armed!
0,“Archers!”
0,"In an instant, five arrows impaled the man’s chest, neck, and head."
0,"When the man was confirmed dead, an archer ran over to reclaim the usable arrows, but he was shot down from an unknown direction."
0,“In the window!”
0,"One of Hattn’s scouts pointed to a window, and a fire mage blew up the side of the brick structure."
0,No more attacks followed.
0,One civilian killed six of his men.
0,"If his scout had not seen the secluded attacker, no one could have followed the path of the invisible projectile."
0,Was that the strength of this city?
0,Was that why they felt no need for walls?
0,"If every man he saw was armed as such, they would not survive until they reached their target."
0,"This was vital information that the young Captain neglected to tell them, or perhaps the boy did not know."
0,The ranged weapons of this world were small despite their lethality and could easily be concealed.
0,He could have spent all his time in this city and not learned that the citizens were armed.
0,"Normally, arming villagers or other civilians was an incredible waste of resources."
0,The thought had never even crossed Hattn’s mind.
0,It was impractical.
0,"But with the quality of the architecture of this city, with the advanced machinery and weaponry these people possessed, the humans of this world could very well have the spare resources to arm the populous."
0,How many people were in this city?
0,"100,000?"
0,"500,000?"
0,More?
0,"If he assumed a tenth of the city was armed, even at the smallest estimate, that was still ten times the number of soldiers his Commanding General sent to this world."
0,"If one hundredth the city was armed, ignoring the city guard and military, that number still matched the strength of their armies."
0,"The massacres in the Amelian Empire would not, could not, be repeated here."
0,“Assume all civilians are armed militia!
0,Be preemptive and kill anything that moves!
0,We must survive until our mission is complete!”
1,"* * *
General Vard pressed his hand tight to his side."
0,"His head felt light, and his body was quickly growing cold."
0,"Behind him, numerous houses burned, the sign of their progress, but in the streets were the bodies of over half his 50 men."
0,“How could we be so… underprepared?”
0,The thunder of the weapons held by the citizens reverberated in his ears.
0,Another three of his men fell.
0,“Sir!
0,We must retreat!”
0,General Vard’s vision grew blurry.
0,The light was fading.
0,"“Lieutenant, you have command now."
0,I underestimated our enemy… 
0,That is my shame to bear… and I will take it with me to death.
0,This is where… that minum attacked.
0,I should have known… they would be prepared.
0,I should have expected a militia…”
0,The lieutenant’s face split in a mist of red from another unseen attack.
0,“We are done…
0,"Forgive me… Lord Jethro, I have failed you…” "
0,May I find myself once more in your care in my next life.
0,General Vard struggled to his feet using his sword as a crutch.
0,"With one final call to rally his remaining men, he charged into the streets."
0,"Fire, arrows, and ice flew over his head at the doors and windows of the houses."
0,"A shot to his shoulder wrenched his back, and he twisted to the ground."
0,In his dark eyes he watched as one by one his men fell until all light left him.
0,"Chapter 17
“Fear and Panic”"
1,"“Gullivan is under attack,” Dr. Shuman announced to Sammy over the phone in a panic."
0,“A large army is attacking from the north.”
0,The rising smoke on the northeast of the city that Sammy had taken no notice of earlier became a terrifying alarm.
0,"She watched it with shaking hands, ignoring whatever else Dr. Shuman was saying."
0,The other students in line outside the testing center chatted among themselves completely oblivious to the dangers.
0,"Perhaps some of them were worried as they looked at their phones, and a few pointed out the smoke rising far in the distance out of curiosity, but their anxiety could very well be due to their approaching exam, not an invasion."
0,"None of them knew what was happening, or they would be fleeing."
0,Sammy hung up her phone.
0,“Everyone!
0,The city is under attack!
0,You need to evacuate!”
0,The line stared at her in disbelief.
0,"A few students grew more nervous, but they kept their vital place in line."
0,They were not Sammy’s problem.
0,She gave her warning.
0,"The one person whom she did care about was still in the testing center, oblivious to what was happening in the outside world."
1,She pushed her way through the line into the testing center to the check-in counter.
0,“What room is Justin Hapfeld in?!
0,This is an emergency!”
0,One of the campus security assigned to the testing center approached.
0,"Before he could speak, she grabbed his arm."
0,“Put the campus into lockdown immediately.
0,"Better yet, evacuate the campus."
0,Dr. Ryan Shuman will vouch for me.”
0,"Those who heard Sammy talked worriedly among themselves, and a few students left their lines."
0,"“Justin is in testing room six,” the receptionist answered, slightly flustered."
1,"Sammy ran through the door, and the security officer chased after her."
0,“Is there a gunman on campus?”
0,“Worse.
0,The city is under attack.”
0,“This isn’t a time for jokes.”
0,Sammy turned to face the officer and pounded her index finger into his chest.
0,“I wouldn’t joke about something like this!
0,"Think about when those people died about a week ago but much, much bigger!” "
0,She then ran to the sixth door down the hall and opened it.
0,“Justin!
0,Jethro’s army is invading the city!”
0,Justin shot up from his desk with enough force to knock over the empty desk behind him and push the rim of his desk into the back of the woman in front of him.
0,"He ran to Sammy ignoring the complaints from the proctor and the profanity spewed at him by the woman, and she pulled him down the hallway."
0,"The Security officer was radioing in Sammy’s message, and she nearly jumped when the lockdown alarms roared in the hallway."
0,"“Dr. Shuman told me over the phone,” Sammy explained."
0,“How did he find out?”
0,Sammy and Justin pushed past the scared students and exited the testing center.
0,“I don’t know.
0,"We can see the smoke from here, so maybe he saw it from his office.”"
0,Justin pulled out his phone and dialed a number while Sammy watched the student’s scatter.
0,"The university never had lockdown drills, so there was confusion on whether the students should enter the buildings to hide in the classrooms like they learned in grade school or escape campus to somewhere else."
0,"“Major Wickenny is not picking up,” Justin said."
0,"“Of course not, you idiot!"
0,He’d be swamped right now!
0,I thought you were calling Sean or something!”
1,"In the brief time Sammy had been inside the testing center, the few plumes of grey smoke had grown into large dark funnels that billowed into the sky showing that the attack had grown immensely and would only worsen."
0,“This is bad…”
0,What do I do?
0,What do I do?
0,Sammy’s mind grew blank from unease and panic.
0,“Ah!” The vibration of Sammy’s jeans pocket made her jump.
0,The name on her phone read Chloe.
0,“Chloe! Jethro’s attacking the city!”
0,“I’m on campus.
0,Where are you?” Chloe asked.
0,“We’re here too.
0,Outside the testing center.”
0,“On my way!” 
0,"While Sammy explained to Chloe where they were, Justin searched his contacts for the number she had admonished him for not calling."
0,“Sean.
0,Jethro is attacking.
0,There is a lot of smoke on the north side of the city.
0,Inform the hospital and see if they can increase security.
0,"We are on our way there… No, I don’t know when."
0,"We are still on campus, and I think Chloe is going to meet us."
0,"I can’t get in contact with Major Wickenny either… Yes, thank you."
0,We will.”
0,"“Chloe!” Sammy pulled Justin over to Chloe, and he nearly dropped his phone, juggling it while she pulled him backwards."
0,"“It’s bad,” Chloe said with a shaking jaw."
0,“There is smoke coming from west of campus too.
0,They’re close.”
0,Sammy saw the fresh black plumes rising above the campus buildings.
0,It was so close that she could see every bulging detail as it billowed into the sky.
0,It wasn’t there a minute ago.
0,How did they get here so fast?
0,Two large fireballs flew over the campus and collided with the side of the humanities building.
0,The small explosions sent glass and debris falling onto the campus grounds.
0,Screams erupted all over campus.
0,“They’re here…” Sammy cried.
0,“Sammy!
0,Justin!
0,Where did you park?” Chloe’s shout brough back Sammy and Justin’s attention.
0,Justin looked towards the direction of the smoke and screams.
0,“On the west side of campus.”
0,“We need to get out of here.” 
0,"Sammy grabbed Justin and Chloe’s wrists, but she could not hold onto Chloe."
0,Just touching her almost burnt her hand.
0,Steam wafted from Chloe’s clothing.
0,"Unable to pull her friend along, Chloe followed Sammy close as they ran."
0,“Why are you so hot?” Sammy asked.
0,“I don’t know.
0,"When you said Jethro was attacking, my body just heated up.”"
0,The three ran south across campus through the pandemonium.
0,The few students who were there to study or take their finals fled in every direction.
1,"As they neared the humanities building, Sammy saw a few injured students who had been caught in the falling debris ignored on the ground."
0,Then they appeared; a mob of medieval- or pre-medieval-armored soldiers ran through the campus.
0,They shot arrows and magic at anyone who moved.
0,The skirmishers drove their swords and spears through anyone they could catch.
0,The soldiers seemed impossibly nimble on their feet despite the weaponry and armor they carried.
0,No one could outrun them.
0,"“Faster,” Sammy cried to herself and her friends."
0,"From the corner of Sammy’s eyes, a man and woman running from the soldiers were engulfed in a fireball and crumbled to the ground."
0,“This can’t be happening!
0,"God, no!”"
0,“Sammy!” Justin pulled Sammy’s arm.
0,Something flew by her face close enough for her to feel it brush her bangs.
0,They stumbled together and fell to the ground.
0,Sammy looked to her left and saw an arrow protruding from the ground about twenty feet away.
0,Sweat beaded and fell from her forehead.
0,A group of five soldiers grew closer.
0,"One of them hurled a fireball at them, the same that had killed the two students just before."
0,Sammy could not move.
0,She only stared at the death that rapidly approached.
0,"Chloe jumped in front of them, and her sleeves burst into flames."
0,She lunged forward and clapped her hands in front of her.
0,An explosion of fire weaker than what she had produced in her demonstration during training erupted out front.
0,It caught the fireball and detonated it.
0,"The heat of the explosion washed over them, but the force blew out sideways like a wedge had been driven between it."
0,“Hurry!
0,I can’t pull you up with my arms like this!” Chloe screamed.
0,Justin grabbed Sammy’s wrist and pulled.
0,"Wasting no movement, they broke into a sprint with Chloe following close behind."
0,The group of five called more soldiers over to help pursue.
0,Two of them nocked arrows into their bows and fired.
0,Justin let go of Sammy and pushed Chloe to the side.
0,"One arrow overshot, but the other traveled right past where Chloe’s back would have been, nearly hitting Justin’s outstretched arms."
0,Neither of them lost their footing and continued running.
0,Another fireball approached.
0,Chloe swung her arm out to release an arch of fire.
0,It had little force but traveled far enough to catch the fireball and detonate it in the air.
0,"Unlike the wedge before, the explosion erupted towards them and knocked Justin and Chloe to the ground."
0,Sammy looked back at her downed friends and the eight soldiers who were quickly gaining on them.
0,Her body shook in fear.
0,"In the deep reaches of her mind, something told her to run, to leave them behind."
0,They would be okay.
0,Justin could dodge attacks.
0,Chloe could fight.
0,"But Sammy, she had no combat potential."
0,She could barely even hold a sphere of water steady.
0,All I can do is create water and swim and make things waterproof.
0,I can’t fight them.
0,I will just slow Chloe and Justin down.
0,I will get them killed!
0,"Sammy took a step back, then another."
0,“Run!
0,We’ll catch up!” 
0,Justin’s eyes pleaded for Sammy to flee.
0,Her heart sank.
0,"She knew that if she fled, she would be the only one to survive, or perhaps with how fast the soldiers were, they would catch her anyway."
0,All her body told her was that she had to move.
0,Sammy’s legs broke into a sprint before she realized.
0,A firm ball of water grew in her hands.
0,"She leapt over Justin and brought her arm back to toss the ball at their attackers knowing full well that it would be useless, but before she could release it or even touch ground, Justin grabbed her ankle and pulled down."
0,She lurched forward and fell face-first into the grass.
0,Two arrows nearly missed her head.
0,"“What do you think you are doing,” Justin yelled."
0,"“I can’t fight!” Sammy screamed back at him, her nose bleeding lightly."
0,“I can at least buy time for you two to get away!”
0,"“Too late…” Chloe looked ahead, and she extinguished her arms."
1,"Six of the soldiers surrounded Justin, Sammy, and Chloe."
0,They knew that at least Sammy and Chloe could use magic.
0,“Eydis where?!”
0,Sammy could not believe what she heard.
0,The soldier pointing his sword at her spoke in English.
0,“Eydis where?!”
0,"In a world with no magic, only those who could use it would be connected to Eydis."
0,Both she and Chloe realized this far too late.
0,They could no longer hope to escape in the panic while the soldiers killed someone else.
0,"The moment they used magic, they became priority targets."
0,Sammy looked at the tip of the sword with fear.
0,"Words would not leave her mouth, and the hand that held the sword grew impatient in her silence."
0,"He thrust the sword at her, but a tug on her hair wrenched her neck to the side."
0,The blade of the sword nicked her ear.
0,Justin then batted the flat end of the sword away with the side of his fist.
0,"“No Eydis here,” Justin shouted back."
0,Sammy recognized the poor Elven that Justin spoke from what little she had learned.
0,The man smiled.
0,He held up his bloodstained hands in the shape of a red cross.
0,"“Eydis here,” the man replied in English, a pleased grin spreading over his blood-speckled face."
0,He knew Eydis was at the hospital.
0,The other soldiers did not seem to understand the soldier’s epiphany.
0,Sammy lunged at the man before he could inform the others of his discovery.
0,"If she was going to die anyway, if she could take down this soldier, then she could prevent this information from spreading and at least save Eydis and Miriam’s life."
0,"He braced against the impact, but Sammy’s weight pushed the oddly light man back."
0,The two soldiers beside him grabbed Sammy and threw her back to the ground in the center of the tight circle.
0,A sword swung and a spear thrust.
0,"Justin grabbed the spear with impossible reflexes and yanked it into the path of the sword, deflecting them away from Sammy."
0,The remaining soldiers brought their weapons down for the execution.
0,“Duck!” Chloe shouted.
0,Justin pulled Sammy to the grass.
0,Chloe’s upper body erupted in flames that exploded outwards in a powerful blast.
0,The six soldiers encircling them caught fire and flailed in burning torment.
0,"Justin broke free of the group, grabbed a dropped sword as he passed, and thrust it into the stomach of the startled bowman who was about to send a warning flare into the sky."
0,The second bowman next to him nocked an arrow and fired.
0,Justin only had time to lift the sword into the path of the arrow.
0,The arrow nicked off the edge of the sword and cut along his shoulder close to his neck.
0,"Before another arrow could be nocked, Justin ran and swung the sword, but an orange glow approached from the corner of his eyes."
0,"He jumped back before a fireball engulfed the bowman, the fire clinging like oil."
0,Sammy sat stunned.
0,All eight soldiers had been defeated in an instant.
0,She then noticed the raging fireball beside her.
0,Chloe’s fire was not dying.
0,It completely engulfed Chloe’s upper body.
0,Chloe dropped to her knees and hunched over.
0,“Chloe!” Sammy produced water ball after water ball and tossed it on Chloe.
0,Each ball had little effect.
0,The heat was too intense.
0,Chloe began to scream.
0,She needed more water.
0,"Using all the ven Sammy could gather into her hands, she forced it to condense and create water."
0,"When she produced water, she channeled more ven into it."
0,"It grew from a trickle to a spout, but it wasn’t enough."
0,She forced more and more ven until her arms ached.
0,"The spout became a constant stream, and steam rose from Chloe’s bare back."
0,The fire weakened and the intense heat abated.
0,"The flames died revealing light pink burns covering Chloe’s back, arms, and face, but they were no worse than a bad sunburn."
0,"“Chloe, are you okay?!” Sammy asked."
0,Chloe shivered from fear and cried.
0,“I… I could not control it.
0,It was getting too hot.
0,I couldn’t stop it.
0,I thought I was going to die…”
0,"The burns did not look severe, but Sammy knew that Chloe would have been terribly hurt if she had not doused the fire quickly, even with Chloe’s incredible resistance to heat."
0,Justin removed his hoodie and handed it to Sammy to help cover Chloe.
0,"The hoodie was a loose fit on Justin from back when he was heavier, so it fit Chloe well enough, but she winced from the pain of the fabric sliding across her skin as Sammy helped her slip it on."
0,“We need to hurry.” 
1,"Justin pulled Chloe to her feet, and they ran off campus, Sammy leading while holding Justin’s other hand."
0,"Sammy continually checked behind her out of fear that other soldiers might follow, and the longer she watched, the more smoke rose from the campus."
0,"More people Sammy knew would be killed, but there was nothing they could do."
0,"Her body shook, and it was then she noticed that the hand she held trembled far stronger than hers."
0,“I… I killed someone.” 
0,It was not Justin but Chloe who spoke.
0,A cold feeling sunk into Sammy’s chest.
0,Both Justin and Chloe just killed multiple people.
0,Justin released Sammy’s hand and held his mouth.
0,He stopped walking.
0,A moment later he lurched over and vomited on the sidewalk.
0,Chloe grabbed her chest.
0,"Her legs grew weak, and she fell to her knees."
0,"Now that the adrenaline of their fight was wearing off, the emotional trauma of what had just transpired surfaced in both her friends."
0,Sammy looked at their struggle to cope with what they had done.
0,"She was the only one unaffected, because she was the only one too weak to fight back."
0,Guilt ate at her and knotted her stomach.
0,"She wanted to throw up just like Justin, but she needed to be the strong one."
0,She needed to help them through this.
0,Sammy gripped both their hands and pulled them to a run.
0,“You didn’t have a choice!
0,It was self-defense.
0,"If you didn’t kill them, they would have killed us."
0,We have a long way to go until we get to the hospital.
0,We might run into more of Jethro’s army.
0,We might have to kill more of them!
0,"If you are this troubled after that, we won’t be able to save Eydis!”"
0,Justin coughed and spat out the sick in his mouth.
0,He wiped his face with his shirt and nodded.
0,“You’re right… 
0,We can’t let them take her.” 
0,Justin trembled despite his declaration.
0,He pulled out his phone and dialed Sean.
0,“The army arrived on campus.
0,We made it out but don’t have a car.
0,They know the hospital is one of the places that Eydis could be at.
0,You need to get her out of there.”
0,Sammy heard gunfire from Justin’s phone.
0,“Sean!
0,Are they there?!
0,"Sean!” Justin shouted, but no answer came."
0,Sean’s phone cut out.
1,"* * *
Pain."
0,Intense burning pain that felt as if Symra’s insides were torn to shreds.
0,Each breath gurgled from the blood filling her lungs.
0,Each cough shot out a spray of red mist.
0,"The faster she ran, the harder she breathed, and the harder she breathed, the more she coughed up blood."
0,"But she was alive, at least for now."
0,The vile human to whom she and her sisters in torment had been given never returned.
0,They lost their usefulness.
0,"Jethro systematically killed them one by one in a teleportation experiment, and had she not taken the slim sliver of hope that presented itself when Jethro’s barrier broke, she too would have died."
0,"So, she fled."
0,She fled until the pain and exhaustion broke her spirit and sent her collapsing to the ground unconscious.
0,An unknown amount of time passed in unconscious darkness without even a thought or dream.
0,Symra’s weary eyes opened and saw a majestic cerulean sky.
0,"A small, almost translucent body fluttered above her and then disappeared letting the bright rays of the sun assault her eyes."
0,"One arm rose to shield her eyes from the blinding light, but the small movement sent snaking pangs throughout her body."
0,"Her muscles were tense and ached, her mind was clouded, and her body temperature was high."
0,"Anyone else would assume they were ill, but for a Mountain Elf these symptoms came from a physiological safety mechanism unique to them."
0,“I… hibernated?”
0,"When a Mountain Elf’s body came under extreme physical trauma, it was forced into hibernation to recover."
0,The length of the hibernation changed depending on the amount of damage and strain on the body.
0,"Even if an inch from death, hibernation could preserve the life of a Mountain Elf."
0,This ability developed due to the near-inhospitable habitats of the ancient Mountain Elves; arid lands and treacherous mountains where food was scarce and the physical toll on the body was high.
0,Symra sat up.
0,Sharp rocks stuck to her back where they had slowly dug impressions over time.
0,She brushed off the rocks one by one while she gazed at the otherworldly scene before her.
0,She sat inside a rocky crag between two spindly bushes.
0,"Outside, a vast and majestic city spread out from the base of the mountain on whose slope she sat."
0,Golden sunlight reflected off glass and metal buildings that stretched up as if desiring to reach the mountain’s heights.
0,The scene would have been breathtaking if not for the smoke rising from the four corners of the city.
0,This was the city Jethro targeted.
0,This was the city where Her Highness was hiding.
0,Jethro was here with his armies.
0,This was an invasion.
0,"No matter her injuries, she had to act."
0,The largest concentration of smoke rose from the north side of the city.
0,"Fires were plentiful, and as she watched, new fires grew."
0,The largest force was located there.
0,A diversion.
0,"In a search operation, the attackers drew most of the city’s forces as far from the suspected location of their target as they could."
0,The only question then was which of the other forces was the primary force.
0,A battle unfolded on the highway leading up the mountain a fair distance from where Symra sat.
0,A small force of soldiers fought their way into the city.
0,The army was far too small.
0,A supplementary force.
0,The fires to the left on the mountain side of the river were few and did not appear to grow.
0,The damage almost looked like it was being suppressed.
0,"In her cloudy memory, Symra felt that she had fled to the mountain from that direction."
0,"Jethro must have used the same coordinates for an attack, but there were likely no more soldiers there."
0,A supplementary force that failed.
0,"On the opposite side of the city, the second largest concentration of smoke rose into the sky."
0,"The number of soldiers there would be high, but something felt off."
0,That was too close to the diversion force.
0,"If that was where they believed Her Highness was located, they would have sent their diversion force to the failed location."
0,"And given the damage, they had not located Her Highness yet."
0,She was not there.
0,"The final location on the far side of the city had little to no smoke, the level of which would not look all that peculiar rising from a large city, at least in her world."
0,"However, the small wisps of smoke grew in a line."
0,"As Symra watched, another new plume rose."
0,"The other locations were fighting where they were, but this army of unknown number was traveling fast."
0,"If they were at half march or even full march, Symra was confident that she could still intercept them from this distance."
0,"From her elevation, Symra memorized the lay of the roads to plan an intercept route to what she believed was the main army."
1,She coated her feet in earth ven to reinforce them and sprinted down the mountain with all haste.
0,"Forest Elves were faster and more agile, but none of the elfkind could compete against Mountain Elves in strength, and only the dryads beat them in endurance."
0,"On top of this, her earth magic gave her a speed boost across land."
0,"Every step she took, flat earth pushed up against her feet and propelled her legs forward."
0,Her light weight in this world further increased the distance of each stride.
0,She reached the city at a breakneck pace.
0,Continual kicks off the ground shot stone pillars up from her feet that launched Symra over building after building until she reached the first road on her mental map.
0,"The shawl hanging from her shoulders billowed in the wind and kept pressing against her face, so she tore it off."
0,"The humans watched in confusion, amazement, and fear as a woman with a tail ran faster than the vehicles down the road leaving demolished pavement and wreckage in her wake."
0,"Turn after turn, she followed her mental map."
0,"By Symra’s estimates, she was nearing her targets."
0,She chanced a glance up to see the smoke not too far off in the distance but nearly collided with one of the strange automatic metal carriages of this world in the process.
0,"After another turn that set Symra on the road to her target, the same semi-translucent body she saw when she woke floated in front of her eyes."
0,It was feminine and beckoned Symra to follow.
0,"Somehow, it was able to keep pace and even moved faster than her."
0,She knew the identity of the figure.
0,"It was a wind sprite, an elemental being from her world."
0,Something inside Symra told her she should follow.
0,The sprite turned sharp down a road that led Symra away from the enemy army.
0,"If she did not focus hard on keeping sight of her, she knew she would lose the small figure."
0,"Turn after turn, road after road, she followed until the sprite led her up a sloped road to a complex of large buildings."
1,There she slowed down and led Symra to a set of large glass doors that opened automatically when she approached.
0,The figure floated above a woman behind a counter before vanishing.
0,The woman behind the counter stared at Symra in dumbstruck astonishment.
0,She lifted some black object to her ear and spoke into it.
0,What do I do here?
0,"Symra’s legs faltered, and she leaned against the counter."
0,The exhaustion of her sprint caught up with her.
0,Pain assaulted her body.
0,"Her chest burned and pleaded for air, and she coughed hard into her forearm."
0,Blood sprayed both the counter and the woman.
0,She was not healed.
0,"The sprite woke her from hibernation, and that should have been impossible."
0,Mountain Elf hibernation was known as the sleep of death.
0,Even severe trauma to the body would not wake a hibernating Mountain Elf.
0,Mountain Elves passed on cautionary tales of those who had collapsed into hibernation in the wild and were discovered half eaten by beasts and yet still slept.
0,Only healing and treatment could wake them.
0,Somehow the sprite cut Symra’s hibernation short and then led her here.
0,"“Call a doctor and bring a stretcher,” another behind the counter ordered to someone unseen in back."
0,"Two men rushed beside Symra, but she pushed them away and found them strangely heavy."
0,Symra knew she no longer had the strength to intercept Jethro’s army and find where they were headed.
0,"Now that she was aware just how injured she remained, attacking the army on her own would be suicide, even though she was confident she could still trim their numbers a little."
0,"In a last desperate attempt to find meaning in being led here, she spoke a single name."
0,“Eydis FeAmel.”
0,Another woman behind the counter reacted.
0,"She looked at Symra’s long, drooping ears and then into Symra’s deep orange eyes."
0,“She’s a type of elf.
0,"She must be connected to Eydis,” she said to the other receptionist who was wiping Symra’s spray of blood off her face."
0,These humans knew Princess Eydis.
0,Maybe she was here.
0,Renewed determination welled up in Symra.
0,"She leaped over the desk and ran down the hall, pushing her pain to the back of her mind."
0,“Eydis!
0,Eydis!” 
0,"She called out, hoping for a reply."
1,"The blinding white hallways were a maze, and Symra had no direction where to go."
0,The sprite returned.
0,It fluttered left and then right towards the end of a hallway.
0,Sprites were citizens of the Amelian Empire.
0,Symra knew where she led.
0,A guard wielding a weapon that Symra had never seen stepped out into the end of the hallway.
0,"He waved to the side, and a second guard appeared."
0,“Don’t move!” they shouted as they pointed their weapons at her.
0,"From the feeling beneath Symra’s feet, she knew stone hid beneath the glossy floor."
0,"She kicked the ground, and jagged pavement jutted up knocking both men to their back."
0,"One fell unconscious from the impact, but the other pointed his weapon and fired."
0,Symra had no time to react.
0,"She knew the loud roar of the weapon announced her death, but the sprite appeared before her."
0,The air rippled like water.
0,Small metal objects fell to the ground at Symra’s feet.
0,"Not wasting the opportunity, she conjured a stone baton in her hand and beat the man across the face."
1,Symra opened the guarded door and met a man and woman.
0,She lunged at the man and swung her baton before they had time to attack.
0,"The man dodged right, but the baton shattered the small rectangular object in his hand."
0,"In the bed to the side, Symra saw her."
0,Princess Eydis lay asleep and very sickly.
0,“What did you do to her!?”
0,"She once again targeted the man, but the woman with him grabbed her arm."
0,"She felt the ven in her body lock up, and with a step and twist of her hip and arms, the woman sent Symra flying over her shoulder back to the ground."
0,Sharp stones appeared in the woman’s hands and one by one they shot out at Symra.
0,This was an earth mage like her.
0,"Symra swung her baton, and the two projectiles exploded into powder on contact."
0,They were weak.
0,This was a novice.
0,"She energized the ven wellpoints in her body, and her ven began flowing again."
0,The baton in her hand molded and changed shape to a curved blade.
0,"In Symra’s other hand, she conjured a second identical blade."
0,"Now that she looked at the two, the man was thin and ill-suited for combat, but the woman was fit, toned, and held a practiced stance."
0,She would not mistake her true opponent again.
0,She felt insulted to call herself the instructor of the palace guard having been caught off her guard and thrown in such a humiliating manner.
0,Pavement shot out below Symra’s feet to propel her forward.
0,Both swords swung down faster than the woman could defend against.
0,They hit the woman’s shoulders and cut down across her chest.
0,"The woman’s clothing sliced open, but there was no blood."
0,"Impossible, Symra mouthed in shock."
0,"Earth ven could be used to protect the body, but Symra had created the strongest and sharpest blades within her power."
0,Symra would not have been able to protect herself to this level.
0,"But even if there was no visible damage, the force of the hit still knocked the woman to her butt."
0,"Even if the body could be protected, places like the eyes were still vulnerable because hardening the eyes led to temporary blindness, so any practiced earth mage avoided it."
0,One of her swords re-shaped into a thin spike that she thrust forward.
0,The sprite appeared in front of the woman’s face.
0,"The air rippled like before, and the spike shattered."
0,Symra looked at the sprite with her mouth agape.
0,It flew over and fluttered above Princess Eydis and then above the woman.
0,"“Do not fight them,” spoke a feminine voice in her mind."
0,Symra realized the first attack the woman performed that locked her ven was the same that she taught the palace guard and royal family.
0,"It was a beginner skill for the lowest rank of bem in the art Symra both practiced and instructed, the first that taught how to temporarily block the flow of an opponent’s ven."
0,These were not enemies.
0,"She stepped back and looked over to Eydis’s bed, but the man moved and blocked her."
0,Fear enveloped him.
0,"He did not want to confront Symra, but something inside him drove him to do so nonetheless."
0,"“You… you are protecting her,” Symra spoke in English."
0,"Symra’s adrenaline abated, and her pain and exhaustion caught up."
0,She sat back into the metal siding of the bed beside her.
0,The man and woman looked at each other.
0,Their hostility and fear vanished.
0,Footsteps came from the door.
0,The guard who had first fallen unconscious entered the room with his gun pointed at Symra.
0,“Stop! She’s not an enemy!” 
0,The woman shouted at the guard and moved quickly to cover Symra while the man hurried to confront the guard and speak with him.
0,Symra looked up at the woman.
0,"The sprite sat on the woman’s shoulder and patted it, but the woman did not notice."
0,"“You, you led me to them, to Her Highness.”"
0,The woman smiled and knelt in front of Symra.
0,“We are Eydis’s friends.” 
0,"“Friend Eydis,” she repeated in broken Elven."
1,"* * *
Of all the people Fect wanted to avoid, his worst fear stood before him holding the bloody corpse of his partner."
0,"“I know you are there, coward."
0,I can smell you.”
0,Fect had delighted in Jethro’s suggestion to bring Penk along on this mission solely for the chance that he may encounter the Doppelganger again.
0,"Jethro stated that Penk would be extra security, and true enough, if Penk had not been there, Fect would be in the clenches of this monster with half his head carved away from the pavement."
0,"Penk’s presence had saved Fect’s life, but not in the manner he intended."
0,He hoped to kill the monster should he and Penk encounter her.
0,He did not understand Jethro’s attachment to her.
0,Now Fect stood alone against the monster once more.
0,Cold sweat ran down his back.
0,He fought to keep his racing heart calm.
0,"So long as he did not move, he would not give away his position, but no matter what he did, he knew the monster would find him eventually."
0,She no longer needed to protect her prey or pet or mate.
0,She could fight unhindered.
0,There was only one chance for Fect to survive.
0,"“Your offense is relentless, but once you lose your initiative, you crumble.”"
0,Captain Byurk had spoken such words to Fect.
0,"If he could strike the monster down before she could target him, he could win."
0,"But if it failed, he would lose to her merciless onslaught."
0,The only advantage Fect had against the monster was his sight-based magic.
0,He did not need to move.
0,"His flame pillars were silent and invisible, but she was fast enough to avoid the attack if she noticed the cement at her feet heat rapidly."
0,"His heat ray was his swiftest magic, acting almost instantly, but if he did not kill her, his position would be revealed."
0,"The condensed fire ven was visible, but if not used at full power, it might remain unnoticed."
0,Eydis gazed around at the sidewalk in front of the police station.
0,"The minum’s scent wafted into her nose, and she could faintly hear his racing heart."
0,"Thankfully, her gruesome execution of the first minum cleared any people in the nearby street, but the few passing cars still made listening difficult."
0,"Her target was somewhere in front of her, but so long as he stayed immobile, she could not see him."
0,She channeled wind ven into her hands causing an intense pain to burn through her body.
0,"Before she could gather enough, the pain grew so intense that her body rejected the ven and stopped."
0,"A wide blade of wind would have forced the minum to move, but she had already used ven to teleport to the police station when she saw the fire from her perch on top the tallest building in the center of the city."
0,"She lacked enough clean ven to use combat magic, and the dead minum in her hands would not supply her any."
0,She regretted not knocking him out instead of killing him.
0,The shirt on Eydis’s chest heated.
0,"She moved the minum in her grip in front of her, and the minum caught fire."
0,The heat grew rapidly until the minum burst into a charred fireball.
0,She released him.
0,"Eydis jumped back, but the pavement beneath her heated."
0,A pillar of fire shot up the moment Eydis dove to the side only to have a second come up from where she landed.
0,"The flames caught her side, singeing her and burning her clothes."
0,A wall of fire grew along her right.
0,"When she moved to the left, a second wall grew."
0,It stretched behind her and filled in close.
0,"Once the walls met both in back and front, she was trapped in a small room of flame only two meters wide."
0,The heat made her drip with sweat.
0,"Eydis was about to jump out, but the instant her feet were about to spring, the front corner of the fire wall detonated, blowing her back."
0,She collided with one of the stone pillars in front of the police station.
0,Another explosion in front of her sent her through the side of the stone pillar.
0,The metal reinforcement inside the pillar cut her arm.
0,Eydis’s vision grew red with the blood running into her eyes.
0,Her chest would not expand to allow her lungs to take in air.
0,The attacks came one after the other without pause.
0,"If she did not move, she knew she would be killed."
0,"… But then, nothing happened."
1,Fect breathed deep.
0,"His assault had worked, but in his haste, he blew the monster outside his line of sight."
0,He did not know how much damage she took or if he could escape.
0,Should he finish her off?
0,But what if she could still fight?
0,"If he moved, she might see him."
0,"Plus, Jethro still wanted her alive, but after everything the monster had done, Fect felt that she was too great a danger and risk to let live."
0,Jethro would understand.
0,"Keeping his eyes on the direction the monster landed, Fect slowly crept closer to the police station for a better position."
0,"When he rounded the pillars, he could not see the doppelganger."
0,A large chunk of the pillar flew into Fect’s field of vision.
0,He focused his eyes on it with all his might.
0,The chunk of pillar heated and then exploded from the ray sending molten and red-hot rock in all directions.
0,“Found you!” Eydis charged.
0,A wall of fire rose from the ground in front of the minum.
0,Eydis kicked the ground with her heel using her Lurr strength and the momentum of her charge.
0,"Cement shards shot through the fire unabated, and a voice cried out on the other side."
0,"She jumped over the wall of flame, but before she could land another immense explosion on the outer wall of the police station sent her soaring through the air to the empty street."
0,Eydis bounced and rolled onto the sidewalk.
0,The bloody minum glared down at her from the steps across the street leading up to the police station.
0,"“You are strong, but you know nothing of combat."
0,You never should have crossed Jethro.
0,"If you would have given us the princess, you could have avoided all this.”"
0,"“I know that already,” Eydis coughed, half smiling."
0,She was long past any regret.
0,A thin line of heat shot from the minum’s dazed eyes.
0,"Unfocussed, it split and pierced through Eydis’s left arm and into her side."
0,"The burning pain charred through her ribs and lung, exiting through her back."
0,The other hit her left leg and bored into the sidewalk.
0,Eydis glared at the minum.
0,She would not let him see her cry in pain nor plead for mercy.
0,The pain from the burn was weaker than the pain of using the toxic ven plaguing her body.
0,She could tolerate it.
0,She rolled to her elbow and smirked confidently at the minum.
0,A second beam fractured worse than the first.
0,"Four rays hit the sidewalk and the building behind her, all missing."
0,The blood draining from his forehead showed some of the cement she kicked up had struck him near the eyes.
0,The minum never approached for better aim.
0,She knew he feared her.
0,The minum grew more and more frustrated.
0,"“Once I am through with you, I will join the assault on the medical facility."
0,I will have your prey and kill all those who protect her.”
0,Eydis knew Justin had been staying in the hospital room every day.
0,"Even though she kept her distance, she tried to monitor his actions to protect him."
0,"If she died here, then Justin would die in the assault on the hospital."
0,That much was certain.
0,She had no time to feign confidence.
0,She still had one spell that used very little ven.
0,"She removed the bloat in the transmission formula that she had always questioned, not knowing whether it was needed."
0,She did not care about stability.
0,"This reduced the ven cost a staggering amount, almost to a hundredth of what it was formerly."
0,"Her body screamed out in pain and agony worse than the burns on her skin or the charred lines through her chest and leg, but with a rush a relief, the spell finished."
0,Eydis extended her hand.
0,"An explosion hit the sidewalk beside her, sending her through the window of the building behind her, but amid the deafening sound, her keen Lurr ears picked up the distinct snap of transmission."
0,"She coughed and spat up blood, pulling herself to her feet and relying on her Lurr resilience to endure the pain."
0,"Across the street, the minum was gone."
0,"Her left leg struggled to support her, and her chest burned with each breath, but because there was no hole despite the pain she felt, she could still breathe well enough."
0,"Forcing the pain to the back of her mind, Eydis limped out of the building and in the direction of the hospital until her leg steadied enough to hold a jogging pace."
0,"In her heart she prayed that she would reach Justin in time, and that the minum could not swim."
0,"Chapter 18
“Resistance”"
1,"Miriam helped a nurse treat the unknown, injured elf while Sean worked to deescalate the panic in the hallway."
0,"Every few breaths, the elf coughed out blood into her forearm."
0,"From what she could hear from the hallway, the elf broke a guard’s nose, a few teeth, and dislocated his jaw."
0,"Once Sean explained that it had been a misunderstanding by an acquaintance of Eydis that could use magic, it appeased some of their worry, but they were still furious about the attack and the damage to the hallway."
0,"The hospital was already overworked due to the sudden influx of patients from the fighting all over the city, most arriving in their own vehicles after escaping the assaulted areas."
0,"“Here, you should cover yourself.” "
0,Miriam handed the elf a hospital gown provided by the nurse.
0,The elf inspected it and pulled it over her head.
0,"It fit loose up top but restricted leg movement, and she did not seem pleased."
0,"She moved her legs, but the fabric caught in odd ways depending on her movements."
0,"After she tore a slit up the side to her hip to give her legs more freedom, she grew content."
0,"“What’s your name,” Miriam asked."
0,"“Symra,” the elf responded, understanding Miriam’s question."
0,“How do you know Eydis?”
0,"“I taught Princess Eydis to fight, same as she taught you.” "
0,Symra’s reply further surprised Miriam.
0,It was perfectly grammatical with only a light slur in the accent.
0,“Your English is excellent.
0,Where did you learn?” 
0,“I learned English as a slave to a man Jethro brought from your world.
0,I begged him to teach me to give the other girls a chance to rest.”
0,Miriam immediately understood the situation Symra was in before arriving on earth.
0,She must have escaped just before or during the attack on Gullivan.
0,“We have no time.” 
1,Symra grabbed Miriam’s arm and pulled her to the hallway where the nurses were treating the downed soldier.
0,The other soldier stood guard and held both rifles.
0,She grabbed the second and pulled it away amidst the shouts of the soldier and the screams of the medical staff.
0,“What are you doing!?”
0, Miriam tried to pull Symra away from the soldier but found the gun thrust into her hands.
0,“Jethro’s soldiers are on their way.” 
0,Symra noticed and grabbed the tactical vest of the downed soldier that had been set aside.
0,"She almost handed the vest to Miriam but then donned it herself, simply pulling it over her shoulders without strapping it around her chest."
0,Two stone blades appeared in Symra’s hands.
0,"The nurses screamed, and the soldier pointed his rifle at the Elf."
0,“Follow her.” 
0,A faint feminine voice that was not Miriam’s spoke inside Miriam’s mind.
0,Sean hurried to Miriam’s side.
0,"“Just before she broke my phone, Justin said that Jethro’s men knew Eydis was here.”"
0,Miriam checked her pocket for her phone.
0,“Shit!
0,I left my phone in the car.”
0,"“Call for whatever reinforcements you can,” Sean ordered the soldier."
0,“An enemy army is on its way here to the hospital.
0,We need to evacuate everyone.”
0,"Miriam ran after Symra who waited at the end of the hall, and Sean followed, but she stopped him."
0,"“No, you stay with Eydis and make sure everyone gets out."
0,I’ll find you and Eydis later.”
0,Sean did not question Miriam’s order.
0,"“Here, take this.” "
0,He removed his coat and handed it to Miriam.
0,"Without embarrassment, Miriam removed her torn coat, shirt, and bra that was only hanging by a single shoulder strap and donned Sean’s coat."
0,“Thanks.”
0,Sean pulled Miriam in and kissed her.
0,Warmth grew from where their lips met and spread downward to dwell within her chest.
0,“Be careful.
0,"Please,” he begged."
0,“I will.
0,"I’m tough, remember?”"
0,"After radioing in Sean’s information about the approaching army, the soldier met Miriam and Symra and helped Symra strap on the tactical vest."
0,He then noticed how Miriam held the assault rifle with proper form and trigger discipline.
0,“Do you know how to use it?”
0,“My father is a gun nut.
0,I was practically born with a gun in my hands.
0,I have fired a SCAR before.” 
0,"Now that she thought about it, he probably wanted her interests to be as far from witchcraft and magic as possible."
0,If only he knew.
0,"Miriam chuckled wryly, which created a small grimace of concern on the soldier’s face."
0,The soldier removed earplugs from his pocket and handed them to Miriam.
0,"“If you absolutely plan on fighting, you should also use my IOTV.”"
0,Miriam accepted the ear plugs but rejected the vest.
0,“My body is strengthened with magic.
0,My skin is probably harder than your vest.”
0,“I’m jealous.” 
0,"Instead of his vest, the soldier handed Miriam two spare clips."
0,“Thank you.
0,What’s your name?” she asked.
0,“Nathan Karls.”
0,“Miriam Schruder.” 
1,The three rushed out of the hospital.
0,Light smoke rose above the buildings about two miles to the south.
0,"“They’re closer than I hoped,” Miriam whispered."
0,There was not enough time to evacuate everyone.
0,“How long until reinforcements come?”
0,Nathan shook his head.
0,“The few of us who were stationed in the city are already engaged with the terrorists.
0,Mark and I were ordered to stay here at the hospital.”
0,He turned to look up at the greying sky from the ever-growing fires on the far side of the city.
0,“Damn it.
0,We should have taken that elf from the city before this happened.”
0,Miriam recalled her earlier premonition when that same suggestion was brought up in their meeting with Dr. Shuman the day after the fake Eydis appeared.
0,"That time as well, a feminine voice spoke in her mind telling her not to remove Eydis from the city."
0,"“Doing so would lead to a greater catastrophe,” Miriam repeated the words of the voice."
0,Was this the voice that her grandmother heard?
0,Was this the source of her premonitions and predictions?
0,The city was under siege.
0,No doubt many people had already died.
0,What disaster could be worse than what was happening now?
0,Did she do something wrong?
0,Was there more to the premonition that she was not connected or attuned enough to hear?
0,Fear bubbled in her stomach and constricted her chest the more she dwelt on these worries.
0,"Miriam claimed to be a witch, but the truth was that her parents kept her away from her grandmother as much as was possible."
0,What training she gained was little more than stories and a trust of things spiritual and natural.
0,She could only maintain steady contact after she moved away from home.
0,"Just before her grandmother’s passing, she said Miriam would grow to be a wonderful witch, and Miriam believed it, joyful to claim the title."
0,"Now, she did not know."
0,She only practiced fake spiritualism in her spare time.
0,She had no way to learn how to be the great witch her grandmother was.
0,Have I failed her expectations?
1,An army of about 200 soldiers in crude armor marched into view at the intersection down the long declining road leading to the hospital.
0,One van that tried to turn and speed away met a fiery demise.
0,Miriam took a deep breath.
0,“Protect the hospital.
0,Protect Sean.
0,Protect Eydis.
0,Here we go.”
0,The road leading to the hospital rose at a three-degree incline.
0,"It was not steep enough to slow the march of the army, but it gave Miriam and Nathan a higher vantage point."
0,"Symra nodded at Miriam and walked out to the center of the road, standing at the top of the incline brandishing her swords."
0,She was in view of the army.
0,A few overeager arrows attempted to fly the distance but missed their mark.
0,Symra only moved to strike down a lucky arrow midflight but returned to her menacing stance.
0,“I am here.
0,"I will not let you pass,” her posture announced."
0,“This way.” Nathan led Miriam back up the road out of sight of the army so they could move unnoticed.
0,They snuck along the side of the road to the perimeter ledge of the hospital to remain hidden and find a vantage point with cover.
0,No cars were parked on the slope or near the top.
0,There were no buildings close to the road.
0,The shrubs and trees planted for aesthetics provided the only weak cover.
0,"The trees were not thick enough to hide behind, but the shrubs were just tall enough that one could kneel or crouch and stay completely obscured, however they provided no protection."
0,“Stay here and wait for my signal.”
0,Nathan continued further down the side of the road.
0,"The brick hospital sign was another fifty yards ahead, but there was a large gap in the shrubbery."
0,"As Miriam worried that he might try to make for the sign, Nathan stopped at the largest shrub before the gap."
0,"He was within arrow range of the army, but they did not notice him."
0,The army was focused on the sole elf standing menacingly in the middle of the road.
0,Miriam had to wonder if Symra knew the nature of the ranged weaponry she and Nathan held.
0,"By using herself as a decoy, she would leave the army open to a surprise attack."
0,The army continued their march and neared where Nathan hid.
0,The first fireball flew from the backline towards Symra.
0,"She remained rooted, unyielding."
0,She kicked the ground with her heel forcing the asphalt to rise into a wall.
0,The fireball exploded with no damage to her.
0,She kicked the wall down and continued glaring at the army.
0,"She would not let this be a long-ranged fight, at least from their end."
0,"Symra shouted in a language other than Elven, and the army responded with a cacophony of shouts and banging metal."
0,Miriam saw in the back of the army an elderly man standing poised.
0,He lifted his hand and shouted orders to the army.
0,She raised her SCAR and aimed.
0,"Max effective range should be somewhere around 300 yards, and he is probably about 200 away…"
0,Miriam’s heart pounded in her chest.
0,"Her entire life from childhood, she had only shot at targets."
0,She had never even hunted before.
0,Not once had she taken a life with a gun.
0,Her breath became ragged.
0,Should I shoot?
0,She looked over at Nathan but could not see him well from his obscured position.
0,He remained motionless and waited.
0,Miriam peered back down her sights at who she believed to be the commander.
0,She slowed her breaths and focused on the rhythm to calm her heart and clear her head.
0,The safety was off.
0,The general was down the sights and compensated for distance.
0,"At the end of a long and full exhale, her finger felt the trigger, but she hesitated."
0,"“Shoot,” spoke the feminine voice."
0,One shot.
0,"After a split-second pause to readjust aim, a second shot followed."
0,Miriam inhaled.
0,Her body shook from adrenaline.
0,"At the back of the formation, Miriam could not see the commander standing."
0,Nathan opened fire.
0,Chaos erupted from the army as the few mages attacked indiscriminately in all directions and rangers scouted to search for the origin of the gunshots that were dropping soldier after soldier.
0,"Taking advantage of the chaos, Symra charged."
0,Miriam’s shot signaled the start of battle.
0,Symra erected a wall on her left to protect her as she attacked the soldiers on her right.
0,Her quick and precise slashes with her curved stone swords showed a well-practiced mastery of the weapon.
0,Each cut avoided the studded leather or thin plate and aimed for joints made of simple fabric or leather that the peculiar stone could cut easily.
0,"Through the struggle, Symra would cough, and slowly blood trickled from her mouth."
0,Miriam remembered how Symra collapsed in the room after realizing that she and Sean were not hostile.
0,Symra was badly injured or sick.
0,Miriam originally planned to target the archers and mages but instead switched to supporting Symra hoping that Nathan would remove the ranged combatants.
0,She lined her sights and pulled the trigger.
0,A spearman who jumped around the small wall to attack from behind crumbled to the ground with a red spray from his face.
0,Another swordsman took advantage of the death of two of his comrades to attack while Symra’s swords were still in them.
0,"Miriam fired, and the bullet hit the swordsman’s side, but it was not enough to take him down."
0,"The soldier forced Symra to release her blades, but she was not defenseless."
0,"Symra struck the soldier in the chest with a weak-formed strike from the back of her wrist, but the form appeared similar to one of the closed-fisted strikes Eydis taught in her self-defense classes."
0,The only difference was the shape of her hand and positioning of her arm.
0,"When Symra rotated her elbow thirty degrees, her posture locked, and the soldier collapsed to the ground spewing blood from his mouth and nose."
0,"Symra claimed to be Eydis’s combat instructor, and perhaps Miriam was now witnessing advanced forms of the art that either Eydis did not know or did not feel safe teaching her students."
0,Symra caught the falling soldier and used his corpse as a shield while she conjured another curved saber.
0,"She left her back open, so another spearman closed in to strike her down."
0,"Symra did not react, so Miriam shot the soldier twice, dropping him."
0,Symra knew Miriam now covered her flank and focused on those in front of her.
0,Miriam shivered with excitement and adrenaline.
0,A small grin curled up on the corners of her mouth.
0,"It scared her to realize this, but she was having fun."
0,"Killing should not come natural to anyone, but for her it was so easy."
0,Miriam continued focusing on the one-versus-many melee while Nathan picked off the ranged fighters and scouts as she had hoped.
0,"They only had three on their side, so the survival of their single vanguard was top priority in Miriam’s mind."
0,"Ten, twenty, thirty, soldier after soldier dropped between her and Nathan’s assault, and Miriam was forced to swap out her magazine."
0,Only one spare remained.
0,"Lacking their general, some of the more confident soldiers became desperate and broke formation to take out the single vanguard or make a run for the hospital, but there were three or four who called them back and continued giving orders."
0,Of course there would be more leaders than a single commander.
0,"After waiting for an opening where Symra could survive without support fire for a few seconds, Miriam targeted one of the men shouting orders."
0,"Three shots later, he dropped."
0,"This enraged the group under his control, but they were seasoned soldiers."
0,"Even without command, they continued working together to fish out their enemies who were picking them off from a distance."
0,The search passed the sign and was nearing Nathan and her position.
0,"In the corner of Miriam’s eye, a lucky fireball landed in the bushes where Nathan hid."
0,The subsequent explosion knocked him back into the metal fencing along the edge of the slope.
0,They found their target.
0,Nathan patted out the flames on his body and quickly ran for more cover.
0,Miriam could see charred burns on his face.
0,Arrows and near invisible wind projectiles flew his direction.
0,Nathan barely had time to dive out of the way before another explosion sent him tumbling to his back.
0,The soldiers who had only focused on Symra now divided their forces to attack Nathan.
0,Symra hurried after them.
0,"If she could reach him, the earlier melee could continue with Nathan as support."
0,An arrow that blustered with visible wind current shot through the air at such an incredible speed that gravity could not pull it into an arch.
0,The arrow embedded itself up to the fletching into the center of Nathan’s vest.
0,A sole archer stood on the shoulders of a giant in the back of the army.
0,He knocked another arrow and fired again.
0,Once more the arrow flew and penetrated through Nathan’s stomach.
0,“Damn it!” Miriam cursed under her breath.
0,She aimed at the archer and giant.
0,One bullet took down the archer with two more killing the giant.
0,"She had outlasted Nathan, not by her skill or reinforcement magic but by the roulette of the battlefield."
0,"Certainly, that same arrow would have killed her just as easily as it killed him."
0,This realization extinguished any sense of thrill in Miriam’s mind.
0,"They were pre-medieval soldiers fighting modern firearms, but they had magic that could compete."
0,"This was war, a life-and-death, kill-or-be-killed struggle."
0,"In Miriam’s hesitation after seeing the death of Nathan, she had forgotten to cover Symra."
0,Symra had multiple bleeding cuts on her body from fighting off her overwhelming attackers.
0,"The cuts were not deep, showing that Symra might have reinforcement magic, but Symra was already fighting injured."
0,The toll was visible in the steadily increasingly lethargy of her curved blade.
0,"Unlike before, the soldiers now parried them with relative ease."
0,An involuntary and intense cough dropped Symra to one knee.
0,No less than ten weapons rose against the fallen elf.
0,Miriam pulled the trigger as fast as she could while attempting with all her might to hold the SCAR steady.
0,Soldier after soldier dropped to the ground giving Symra time to pull back and retreat.
0,A sharp pain hit Miriam’s right temple and caused her head to twist to the side.
0,The arrow that hit her head skidded across the road.
0,Her cover was blown.
0,A second and third arrow followed and narrowly missed her.
0,A fourth hit her shoulder and bounced off.
0,"The pain was intense, her magic only preventing it from penetrating."
0,She tried firing amid the rain of arrows but was forced to run when a fireball flew her direction.
0,"She was far enough from the explosion to stay standing, but the pressure knocked the wind out of her."
0,Symra retreated after Miriam.
0,"They no longer had their surprise advantage, and most the army still remained."
0,Miriam fought to ignore the pain of the arrows hitting her and wondered how long her ven would last.
0,Symra propelled herself back to avoid a fireball and landed two yards to Miriam’s left.
0,"When their eyes met, they knew they needed to retreat and find another strategic location."
0,Together they broke into a sprint and trusted their reinforcement magic to keep them alive.
0,Miriam glanced back as she ran and saw four large fireballs flying their direction.
0,The fireballs converged midflight and created a massive burning sphere that radiated heat so strong that Miriam could feel it.
0,There was no way she could defend against that.
0,Symra noticed the heat and turned back to erect and emergency wall as thick as possible in the short time she had.
0,The burning sphere struck the back of the wall with incredible force and erupted into an explosion that shook the entire hospital complex.
0,"The heat was suffocating, and Miriam’s ears rang despite her earplugs and the reinforcement magic she applied, but she and Symra survived."
0,They pulled each other out of the rubble of the wall and continued running while Miriam shot at who she could.
0,"From their position, Miriam could see the evacuation of the hospital in full force."
0,"The soldiers also noticed, and two platoons broke off to break up the evacuation."
0,Miriam fired at them but could not stop the fifty or more soldiers.
0,There was nothing she could do.
0,"Only a small feeling of relief came from the knowledge that Sean and Eydis were not in that direction; however, if the army continued pushing her down the road, she would arrive at that wing of the hospital where Sean and Eydis resided."
0,The remaining army continued their pursuit after Miriam and Symra.
0,"The number of soldiers slowly dropped with every shot of the SCAR, but the final magazine eventually ran dry."
0,Miriam created a sharp spike of stone with her ven and threw it at the soldiers in desperation.
0,"The ven placed on the back propelled it forward at incredible speed, but it shattered against a soldier’s shield without making so much of a dent."
0,The words from the fake Eydis’s training echoed in Miriam’s mind.
0,“Still not good enough.”
0,"Miriam did not know who the fake was or her purpose in training them, but just like the true Eydis, her instruction was designed to hone in on Miriam’s weaknesses."
0,Miriam’s rocks were hard but far too brittle to be used as weapons.
0,The martial training taught her by the true Eydis would also do little against such large numbers.
0,"Without a gun, she was defenseless."
0,"Once again, four fireballs approached and converged into one."
0,"Symra tried to erect another wall, but she was panting too hard and her stance was weak."
0,The wall that jutted from the street was thin.
0,"She turned to Miriam and shouted, “Build a wall!”"
0,“I can’t… I don’t know how.” 
0,They both knew the magnitude of the danger that rapidly approached and that they had no way to prevent it from hitting them with full force.
0,Miriam and Symra braced themselves behind the thin wall.
0,"With all the ven she could gather, Miriam coated her body and strengthened it to the extent of her ability."
0,"The blazing sphere exploded, and everything went dark."
1,"* * *
“We have thirteen in this wing, seven requiring special care and transport."
0,How many ambulances are available?”
0,“Only five.
0,The rest have already been dispatched.”
0,“Radio them and tell them not to return if they have injured.
0,"If they don’t need the extra wheels, we do."
0,All incoming urgent care patients are to head to the 27th Street clinic until they are stable enough to travel.
0,All others who can handle the 50 miles are to head north.”
0,“I just got word nine busses are on their way.
0,They will be here in ten minutes depending on traffic.
0,We still have our vans available as well.”
0,"Doctors, nurses, and administrators ran about the halls of the hospital like an army of ants whose anthill had been stepped on."
0,Their first priority was to ensure safe travel for critical patients to the nearest hospital just over fifty miles away.
0,Local clinics in the city would temporarily house patients within their medical specialty where feasible until it was safe to return to the hospital or they needed to head north as well.
0,"Sean helped where he could amid the chaos, but not knowing the hospital’s evacuation plan, he was mostly getting in the way of the practiced professionals."
0,“Do not stand in the hallways.”
0,A sweating male nurse pushed a heavyset man on a gurney past Sean.
0,The sound of an explosion shook the walls of the hospital.
0,"A few feminine yelps and masculine cries echoed in the halls, but the fear only increased the urgency of the evacuation."
0,The receptionist at the counter hastily made phone call after phone call.
0,A female nurse looking behind her as she ran bumped shoulders with Sean as she passed.
0,"A man in a suit jogged in Sean’s direction, but like everyone else, he paid Sean no attention."
0,Sean rushed to the man’s side.
0,“Is there anything I can help with?”
0,“Get rid of that damned elf!” 
0,The man sneered and continued running down the hallway.
0,"Sean stood frozen, unsure how to reply."
0,Eydis was the reason the hospital needed to evacuate.
0,Her presence placed everyone in danger.
0,"“Don’t stand in the hall!” Another gurney pushed past, the eleventh from Sean’s count."
0,Sean was just in the way.
0,He returned down the hallway outside Eydis’s room.
0,No one came.
0,"He heard that there were thirteen patients in this wing, but when the twelfth passed the end of the hall, his worry grew."
0,They would come for Eydis next.
0,"A door halfway down the hall opened, and an elderly woman on a gurney passed."
0,“Wait!
0,Hold on!”
0,The nurse did not listen to Sean and continued evacuating his patient.
1,Sean ran back down the hall and jumped over the upturned cement floor.
0,He had to make sure he did not somehow miss Eydis’s evacuation.
0,"Inside the room, Eydis slept in her bed."
0,“Damn it.”
0,Sean grabbed the first person he could find back down the hall.
0,“There is still a patient back here.”
0,“I was informed that she was the last one.” 
0,The nurse thumbed to the gurney that turned the corner out of sight.
0,“Eydis is still back there!”
0,A hand rested on Sean’s shoulder.
0,"Feeling that the suited man would help Sean, the nurse hurried after the final gurney."
0,“We will not be taking the elf with us.
0,The people attacking the city are after her.
0,"If we bring her, they will follow and place us all in danger."
0,This is a decision made by the hospital.”
0,"Sean prided himself on being levelheaded and remaining calm under pressure, but his chest burned with anger."
0,This was blatant injustice.
0,"His hands balled into fists, and he struck the man across the face."
0,The man staggered back a little and rubbed his jaw.
0,The punch was embarrassingly weak.
0,"“You keep calling her elf, elf."
0,Are you doing that to say that Eydis is inhuman and not worth helping?
0,What about your oath as a doctor?!”
0,"“Our job is to save lives, and that is what we are doing."
0,I must prioritize the many over the one in this case.
0,Sorry.” The man’s tone was anything but apologetic.
0,"He was the one who made the decision, not the hospital."
0,"“If you want to evacuate her, take her away in your own car.”"
0,Sean did not voice his building rage but instead ran down the hall back to Eydis’s room.
0,Escaping with Eydis in his car was not possible.
0,"He had arrived with Miriam and Sammy, and then Sammy left with Justin in his car for Justin’s final."
1,Sean inspected Eydis’s bed and then the door.
0,"The bed was far too large to fit through the door, and even if it could, the destroyed floor of the hallway would not let the bed pass."
0,He rushed out of the room and opened door after door hoping to find a smaller bed or gurney.
0,“Is there anyone still here?!”
0,The hallway was silent.
0,The main hall of the wing was the same.
0,“Is anyone here!?”
0,Sean continued checking rooms until he finally found one with a thinner bed.
0,"He unplugged the power cord, tossed the control pad on it, and pulled."
0,It didn’t budge.
0,"After a deep breath to calm down, he unlocked the wheels and maneuvered the bed out the door and down the hall."
0,The upturned floor was as close as he could push the bed.
0,"He removed Eydis’s IV using the methods he had seen many times before when giving blood, removed her catheter with no small amount of trouble, and carried her to the bed."
0,He pulled the bed down the hallway to the door by the main reception counter.
0,No one remained in the lobby.
0,"The hospital was efficient in its evacuation, but he knew that the other buildings and wings with multiple floors would still be working hard to evacuate all the other patients."
0,"If he could take Eydis to one of the evacuating groups from a different wing, they should take her, he hoped."
0,Sean pulled the bed out the switch-activated double doors to the lobby.
0,A loud explosion rattled the glass doors and Sean instinctively crouched down for cover.
0,"On the road just past the emergency drop-off roundabout, Miriam flew into view about ten feet off the ground and rolled onto the pavement."
0,The rifle she held flung out of her hands and bounced away from her.
0,She struggled to stand.
0,A fireball flew over her and landed twenty feet behind her.
0,The explosion knocked her back to the pavement.
0,“Miriam!”
0,Blood drained from Sean’s face.
0,He forgot the task he was engaged in and ran out the doors to pull her to safety.
1,Another explosion shook the lobby.
0,The florescent lights on the ceiling flickered.
0,Two fingers on the bed twitched and then slid across the dim blue mat.
0,Water welled in weary eyes that had not opened for weeks and then fell like dew from a pale leaf.
0,Eyes too hazy to make shape or form of the light gazed upwards at the ceiling.
0,A broken and raspy whimper disturbed the empty lobby.
0,“Justin…”

“I apologize for interrupting the work I gave you."
0,The invasion took priority.
0,But it looks like you were able to get back on track without too much trouble.”
0,"Jethro sat across a grand redwood table from Emer inside a massive, redwood-accented, white-marble banquet hall."
0,Emer’s hand raced over a piece of parchment to write the spell he had been working on since the success of the transmission experiment.
0,"“If you wanted to take part in the invasion, you could have waited another day.”"
0,"“I had no idea how far you were, and this wasn’t something I could delay."
0,To think you had just about finished when I stopped you.”
0,“The break in focus made this take longer than it would have otherwise.” 
0,"“Oh, I understand that.” "
0,The quill stopped moving.
0,"One by one, Emer lifted the parchment and scanned it over for errors."
0,"He wanted with all his heart and soul to slip in an error, some fatal flaw that would kill Jethro, but the kissiae entangled with his body prevented him from even penning such a betrayal against the one who was her master."
0,"Even if the kissiae knew nothing of spatial magic, she could perceive his thoughts and understood his will even better than he did."
0,No instinct or unconscious action could deceive her.
0,He was under her complete control.
0,The spell had no errors as written.
0,He slid the parchment over to Jethro who also scanned it over and inscribed it to memory.
0,“Peculiar.
0,"Even though the formula looks nothing like the original in structure, I can see all the vital elements that make it the original’s perfect partner."
0,How were you able to finish the coordinate reversal so quickly and elegantly?”
0,"“Practice,” Emer said flatly."
0,Jethro slouched in his chair.
0,“I cannot even imagine what would be possible for me if my lifespan was as great as yours.
0,You elves are truly a blessed race.”
0,The words that would normally sound like praise or complement rang in Emer’s ears as those of a madman hiding pure malice and rancor behind a smiling façade.
0,"“No other spatial mage aside from you or I could manage such a spell, so unlike last time, you must be my test subject."
0,Pray that this works the first time.”
0,“I am confident it will.” 
0,“Good.
0,"Keeya, make certain he returns immediately to this room once he arrives in the other world."
0,We have no time to waste.”
0,Keeya nodded.
0,Emer stood from his chair and moved a short distance from the table.
0,"Without even a breath to concentrate, he encased himself in a barrier and activated the inter-world transmission spell."
1,The redwood-accented marble dining hall vanished and was replaced with a graying sky and open field.
0,Emer stood on the cement foundation of some demolished structure.
0,The thin wind caressed his face.
0,"In the distance, a grand city rose from the fields at the foot of a mountain."
0,Smoke rose as a black mist from the city.
0,"In Emer’s mind, he could almost hear the screams of the citizens who were thrust into a war with an enemy they never knew existed."
0,It pained his heart that he was the cause of their strife.
0,"If he had not made a mistake in his formula to help the First Princess escape, she would have been placed in the care of another nation of their world."
0,The people of this city would have been able to continue their lives in whatever peaceful manner they pleased.
0,Emer’s jaw quivered.
0,“I am so sorry.”
0,“Must return.” 
0,A simple command wormed its way into Jethro’s mind.
0,"Without any intent or control on his part, Keeya activated the newly designed transmission spell through him."
1,“I see you are in one piece.
0,Any pain or fatal injuries?”
0,Jethro’s lighthearted tone was sickening.
0,"Emer remembered the faces of the innocent women who died in the last experiment, their tears and pleas for mercy."
0,Dyas…
0,“Are there any complications with Emer’s body?” 
0,Keeya shook her head.
0,“Wonderful!
0,"I guess it is time I take a look at this grand, new world.”"
0,Jethro vanished leaving Emer alone in a hall too large for one person.
0,He collapsed to his knees on the floor and pounded it with his fist over and over.
0,He increased the force of each consecutive hit with gritted teeth.
0,Suddenly his hand would no longer move.
0,“You are hurting us.”
0,“I don’t care!” 
0,“We do care.” 
0,"“After everything I did to save her, after she tried her hardest to live a life away from all this conflict, I handed Jethro the weapon to hunt her down."
0,You made me place a knife at Eydis’s neck!”
0,"Emer grabbed a vine digging into his stomach, but Keeya would not let him pull at it."
0,"As often as he tried to tear the kissiae off him, he never could."
0,“Why?!
0,"Why do you obey Jethro when you know he is an enemy to all elfkind, to all dryads?!"
0,Why do you let him kill your own empress who has done nothing but love and care for the people of her empire?”
0,“A small price for survival of kissiae.” 
0,“Are the elves truly alone in their struggle?” 
0,Keeya ignored Emer’s dejected mumble and smiled.
0,“Let’s explore palace until Jethro return!”
0,Emer could not even voice his disproval as Keeya whisked him away out of the dining hall.

“Still no contact from the police."
0,Assume communication has been compromised.”
0,“Fifth Humvee is down.
0,All wheels on site are inoperable.”
0,Colonel Richards wiped his hand down his face.
0,“Do we still not have a number on how many are out there?”
0,"“Aside from the estimated four to five hundred north of the city, reports are still coming in about hostiles throughout the city."
0,"The Southeast has been neutralized by the civilians, but fighting continues at the university.”"
0,The screen to Colonel Richard’s left showed areal footage from a news helicopter.
0,About two square miles of the northwestern corner of the city burned.
0,"Buildings along the east highway leaving the city billowed smoke, but the damage did not seem to be spreading."
0,The university campus in the distance was not even visible through the volume of its smoke.
0,"Major Wickenny said it was a handful of terrorists, not a fucking army."
0,“Sir!
0,Gullivan Central Hospital has sent out an urgent request for aid.”
0,“How long ago?” 
0,“Not long.
0,Five minutes.
0,They claim to be a direct target of the attacks and are evacuating.
0,The enemy is on top of them.”
0,“Anyone in the area?” 
0,"“Aside from the two positioned there, none.” "
0,“They are after Ms. FeAmel.
0,Where are the nearest ground forces?”
0,“All we could contact are engaged elsewhere.
0,Radio silence from those at the police station.”
0,This was a precisely planned attack.
0,The enemy knew the police were the central contact with the military and somehow broke that line of communication.
0,The number of Army personnel stationed in the city was meant as reinforcements for the police in the event of a terrorist attack.
0,There were not enough to stop an army assaulting four or five separate locations.
0,The initial request for additional reinforcements arrived an hour and a half ago after the first contact with hostiles on the northern edge of the city.
0,"Ground and air forces were dispatched, but nearly three hundred miles was a long distance to cover."
0,"Police from nearby cities were contacted and should have arrived, but with the central communication between law enforcement in the city cut, organizing them would be difficult."
0,This was proven by the sole fact that none of the additional police had contacted him yet.
0,“Contact all police departments of the neighboring cities and link them with us.
0,"If that is not possible, I want every cell-phone number of every officer you can find."
0,ETA on air support at the city?”
0,“Three eggs in 15.
0,Apache in 30.”
0,“Send two to the hospital and the third to the University.
0,"The Apache will continue to the main force in the north, but inform them to keep their ears open.”"

“The Master of Time and the Bridge between Worlds”"
1,Jethro breathed in the warm air that tasted faintly of ash.
0,“The air is so much easier to breathe in this world.
0,The air in Whinhlem is too suffocating.”
0,The gravel of the driveway crunched beneath his boots.
0,There was no sense of urgency in his gait.
0,The city before him was ablaze.
0,"Smoke rose into the sky in such volume that grey mist was beginning to tint the otherwise blue sky, and if Jethro looked closely, he could see small flecks of black drifting down around him."
0,"If he ignored the destruction, the buildings of the cityscape had an almost nostalgic feel."
0,"It felt like ages since he had last seen tall rectangular structures, yet their shape and form still looked primitive, confirming his earlier assumptions after viewing the handgun now strapped to his waist."
1,"Jethro vanished, and the scenery changed in an instant to a lively city."
0,"He appeared in midair, but before he could fall a barrier supported him from underneath."
0,It held stable in space and was unaffected by gravity.
0,"The wind blew strong and tasted of ash, but at his height it was not thick enough to obscure his view of the city."
0,He only stood at about three times the height of the two- and three-story buildings below.
0,"He would have liked to stand atop the tallest buildings in the city, but the view would be obscured by the plentiful smoke."
0,"No progress had been made on the residential districts bordering the river, but smoke rose from both the university and hospital."
0,General Makstev had succeeded in diverting enough of the city’s fighting power to enable General Hattn and General Teppo to reach their targets.
0,A small column of smoke even rose from Fect’s estimated location of the city guard headquarters.
0,"“Or, given the similarities, it was probably more of a police force or constabulary.”"
0,Jethro chuckled to himself.
0,It was like looking at a window into ancient history.
0,Whinhlem was far too dissimilar to elicit the same feeling of nostalgia.
0,"In the distance, two dots hovered in the air above the city."
0,"He could not make out precisely what they were, but they did not attack."
0,“Observation?”
0,Jethro vanished again and appeared in a freefall near the flying vehicle.
0,It suspended itself in the air with a large propeller mounted on top and a smaller propeller on the tail for areal stability.
0,“Truly primitive.
0,And here I got my hopes up that technology here would be a little more advanced than this.”
0,His descent grew level with the helicopter.
0,A swipe of his arm sliced off the tail.
0,The helicopter immediately spun out of control and lost elevation.
0,Jethro vanished again and reappeared on top a nearby building to watch the vehicle crash.
0,There was no safety or escape mechanism built in.
0,This world’s flying vehicles were nothing but death traps.
1,"After a disappointed sigh, Jethro teleported to the window of the second helicopter."
0,A man controlled a large machine with what looked like a lens.
0,The operator jumped back into the other side of the compartment in surprise.
0,These flying machines were not weaponized.
0,"As expected, they only observed the battle."
0,Jethro jumped out and swung his arm.
0,The propeller detached from the top of the helicopter and spun upwards while the machine plummeted.
0,“That should halt some of the information passing to their forces.
0,"Now, to the hospital.”"
1,"Back in the communication room at Fort Samper, Colonel Richards happened to be watching the news feed when a man appeared out of thin air before the camera."
0,"Shortly after the man jumped away, the helicopter dropped from the sky amid the screams of its passengers."
0,Cold sweat beaded on Colonel Richard’s forehead.
0,He scrambled to the side of the table and shuffled through a stack of papers.
0,Those in the room who were not actively engaged in another task watched their usually composed commander with confusion.
0,"Colonel Richards found the paper, a facial composite made by the imposter Eydis FeAmel of a man she stated was unrivaled in magic ability, a man who could cut through their defenses like butter."
0,He rushed to relay new orders.
0,A superhuman weapon had appeared on the battlefield.

Justin, Sammy, and Chloe ran onward toward the hospital ignoring their aching bodies screaming in protest."
0,"In the distance, smoke rose from the hospital."
0,"Oh God, please let Eydis be okay."
0,"Justin had never prayed seriously once in his life, but if there was ever a time he needed a miracle, it was now."
0,Two ambulances had passed them on the road heading north as well as a handful of vans and busses.
0,"Evacuation was in full force, and he hoped with every heavy beat of his thundering heart that Eydis was on one of them, but he also knew he could not make any assumptions."
0,"Until he saw Eydis personally, he would never feel safe."
0,"Until he was with Eydis again, he would not feel relief."
0,The driving force that cut deep in his heart and kept him moving was the gunfire he heard before Sean’s phone cut out.
0,“Hurry it!” Sammy was in far better shape than Justin.
0,She looked back at him from twenty or so yards ahead.
0,Chloe was even further ahead.
0,Justin’s chest burned.
0,"He did not know how much further he could go, but the hospital was in sight, so he had to push through the pain and exhaustion."
0,"When Justin caught up to Sammy, she grabbed his wrist and pulled him along."
0,“Only two more blocks.
0,You can make it.
0,We’ll see Eydis.
0,I promise.”

0,"“If the hospital was near the river, I’d be there already!"
0,"If I had parked the car somewhere else, we’d be there already!"
0,Gah!”
0,There was nothing she could have done.
0,They were just unlucky.
0,Justin forced himself to keep hope.
0,"If he let doubt fill his already worried heart, he would collapse on the spot."
0,They were lucky enough to escape campus alive after being directly targeted by soldiers.
0,"One block to go, but now the road inclined."
0,The hospital and the rest of the city westward sat atop an elevated fluvial terrace rising out of what had anciently been the river’s flood plain.
0,Each step up the shallow incline was heavier than the last.
0,"If Sammy was not half pulling him up, he would not make it."
0,“They’re under attack!” Chloe called from atop the incline.
0,"Spurred by energy Justin did not know he had, he raced beside Sammy up the remainder of the incline."
1,"Two of the hospital buildings burned, and numerous soldiers were attacking people trying to load patients into vans and busses."
0,They had not seen any more vehicles pass down the road because those vehicles could no longer leave.
0,"Two police officers fought desperately to shoot the assailants, but they were killed as Justin watched."
0,"The number of dead was low from what they could see, so the massacre had only just begun."
0,"“We need to help them!” Chloe ran off towards the soldiers, but Justin and Sammy hesitated."
0,Neither of them had any confidence in their combat ability.
0,Justin’s hesitation vanished in an instant.
0,"Two swift-footed soldiers caught a fleeing woman cradling a young, bleeding boy in her arms."
0,One of them ran both woman and child through with a single thrust of his spear.
0,Justin’s exhausted feet moved forward after Chloe.
0,He had to do something.
0,He could not sit back and watch these innocent people die.
0,“Damn it.
0,Damn it.
0,Damn it!” 
0,"He shouted, both to fent his anger and to spur his exhausted body forward."
0,"Ahead, Chloe intercepted the pair of spearmen."
0,"They were not expecting retaliation from a woman, and their hesitation proved fatal to the one who struck the killing blow."
0,Chloe’s fist erupted in flames and exploded upon impact with the face of the soldier’s open helmet.
0,The second soldier backed away and used the length of his spear to his advantage.
0,Chloe was barely able to avoid the thrusts and was forced to retreat.
0,"Sammy conjured a ball of water and threw it with perfect aim, hitting the soldier in the face."
0,That minor distraction was all Chloe needed to close the distance.
0,"She swung her arms together, and when they clapped, a flame shot out into the soldier’s face."
0,"It was not powerful, but the soldier cried out."
0,His face charred and his eyes sealed shut.
0,"Sammy grappled the wailing soldier to the ground, and Chloe stomped his head at an angle."
0,His neck snapped with a pop.
1,Both Sammy and Justin grabbed one of the bloody spears and ran at the main body of the soldiers.
0,A bitter feeling in the pit of Justin’s stomach told him that he was running to his death.
0,How many soldiers were there?
0,Forty?
0,Fifty?
0,"They were lucky that the two spearmen could not use magic, but a few of the soldiers ahead of them were clearly using fire, water, and earth magic to massacre the people."
0,He did not doubt there was wind magic intermixed but invisible in the chaos.
0,"One lone, aged soldier took notice of their approach and separated himself from the group."
0,"From his gait and how he held his sword, he gave the impression of a battle-hardened veteran unlike the two teenaged spearmen from before."
0,He called out in a language that was not Elven and grew a smile.
0,"Another soldier followed for backup, but the man waved him off."
0,He noticed them take out the two young spearmen and was looking for something better than a one-sided massacre.
0,"Unlike Chloe’s earlier reckless charge, she approached cautiously."
0,Only her fists grew flames to keep her heat under control.
0,"Sammy conjured a water ball and tossed it to create another opening, but the soldier flicked his sword and hit the water ball with the flat side of the blade without even moving his torso or breaking his stride."
0,This man was a professional.
0,"“Chloe… this is a bad idea,” Sammy said."
0,The soldier charged and covered the remaining distance in a second.
0,Chloe jumped back to avoid the sword’s downward swing.
0,The blade nicked the tip of her chin and the front of Justin’s hoodie.
0,The damage to her face was only a scratch and the blade only cut a small portion of fabric.
0,"Leaving no time for Chloe to recover, a thrust came next."
0,"Justin swung the tip of his spear upwards, and time slowed to a crawl."
0,He could see the soldier’s sword move forward inch by inch.
0,His own spear was going to miss.
0,It was not extended far enough.
0,Chloe was going to be killed.
0,"Justin stretched his arm out, abandoning his balance, to increase the reach of the spear."
0,The sword’s edge caught on the socket and wings of the spear’s tip.
0,"The force was weak, but it deflected the blade enough to pass just under Chloe’s arm."
0,"The soldier jumped back, and Justin tripped to the ground."
0,Time resumed its normal pace.
0,"Justin expected the soldier to attack, but he was given enough time to right himself."
0,The soldier expressed both amazement and joy.
0,Justin parried a veteran’s blade.
0,The veteran brandished his sword in a stance that Justin felt was defensive despite knowing nothing about swordplay.
0,Sammy hurried to Chloe to make sure she was okay.
0,Justin stood alone between them and the soldier.
0,"“We can’t fight him,” Sammy screamed."
0,“We need to run!”
0,"“He’s not going to let us go,” Justin said, not breaking eye contact with his opponent."
0,The spear felt like lead in his hands as the veteran stared him down.
0,The veteran grew more and more confused.
0,His eyes kept jumping between Justin’s grip on the haft and Justin’s eyes before lowering his guard slightly.
0,The next strike did not hold the same ferocity as before.
0,It swung diagonally down to cut at Justin’s right arm.
0,Time slowed the moment Justin moved his spear.
0,He stepped to the side and blocked the slash with the butt of the haft.
0,The sword cut in and got caught in the hard wood.
0,Justin almost lost his balance while ducking under and spinning the back end of the spear to the side to deflect the blade.
0,Time returned to normal.
0,The face of the veteran grew even more confused as if wondering whether Justin was actually skilled in combat or simply lucky.
0,The next attack thrust at Justin’s unguarded stomach.
0,The blade approached at a snail’s pace and was easy enough for Justin to sidestep so the blade slid under his arm.
0,The veteran stepped forward and shifted his body weight.
0,The blade swung sideways at Justin’s torso.
0,The spear was on the other side of the blade and could not be brought in to block the strike.
0,Justin had no other choice but to release the spear and drop his body while jutting back away from the incoming blade.
0,His body moved slower than the blade.
0,He watched the blade approach as he reeled back.
0,The blade touched his shirt and dragged it along his chest until the tension forced the blade to cut the fabric.
0,"He felt the cold chill of the blade slide across his right breast, but it did not cut in."
0,It finished its horizontal arch an inch over his face.
0,Justin’s back hit the pavement.
0,Time resumed.
0,Fire flew over Justin and forced the veteran to retreat a few steps.
0,Justin kicked frantically back against the pavement to place as much distance as he could from the soldier.
0,His hand felt the torn shirt on his chest but there was no blood.
0,The moisture he felt was the sweat seeping from every pore in his body.
0,"Sammy pulled Justin up, and they ran as Chloe’s punches spewed flames behind their flight to keep back their potential pursuer."
0,Fear and bitterness welled up in Justin’s stomach and brought tears to the corner of his eyes.
0,He realized how foolish they had been.
0,The only reason they killed the soldiers pursuing them at the university and the two spearmen that killed the woman and child was because they caught them by surprise.
0,They could not compete against these trained soldiers in a real fight.
0,He looked behind at the innocent people in the thick of slaughter.
0,They could not help.
0,"All they could do was find Eydis, Sean, and Miriam and then run for their own lives."
1,"* * *
A sense of relief washed over Eydis."
0,She arrived at the edge of the parking lot in time to see the thrust and sideways slash of the soldier.
0,"Justin avoided any harm, and Eydis knew she had his time magic to thank."
0,"After one final glance at the carnage, Justin did not look back."
0,He and Sammy and Chloe ran off around the side of the building.
0,The soldier who had confronted them called back towards his fellow soldiers.
0,“We have priority targets!
0,Let’s move!”
0,No less than ten or twelve heard his call.
0,"A sense of urgency laced with adrenaline spurred Eydis’s aching body to action, numbing the pain."
0,“You will not harm him.”
0,Pavement buckled under her bare feet with the thrust of her good leg.
0,The gap between her and the first soldier disappeared in an instant.
0,Her fist collided with the side of his helmet with the creak of buckling metal.
0,"Red gore spewed from the opening, and the crushed head ripped clean off its shoulders at the completion of her swing."
0,"Unable to stop on her injured leg, Eydis collided with the side of the building twenty yards from where the soldier’s body dropped."
0,"The impact knocked the wind out of Eydis, but she recovered quickly and stared down the other soldiers who looked back with terrified faces."
0,One of them noticed Eydis’s eyes.
0,“It’s a Lurr!”
0,All soldiers immediately prepared for combat.
0,Eydis grabbed the trunk of a young tree no thicker than her arm and ripped it from the bed lining the side of the building.
0,The roots left a trail of dirt as it dragged.
0,Eydis snapped off the top of the tree where the first branches grew and brandished her makeshift club still caked with rock and dirt.
0,She charged.
0,The first swing hit three soldiers and sent them flying through the air.
0,Their light weight in this world only added to the distance.
0,"Two shields blocked the second swing, but both buckled under the force, and the two soldiers flew."
0,Eydis smiled.
0,None of these soldiers had magic or they would have used it.
0,It was purely a contest of strength.
0,“Die.” 
0,"Her voice was calm but reeked of an unbridled hatred of humanity, or at least the humans of her world."
0,Swing after swing killed soldier after soldier.
0,"The clumps of dirt and rock broke away leaving gnarled bunches of fractured and broken roots that impaled the faces, torsos, and appendages of the soldiers where armor was weak or missing."
0,One last swing and the trunk finally snapped.
0,The sole survivor of the onslaught brandished a shaking spear at Eydis.
0,Eydis’s eyes flared.
0,"The soldier tried to run back to his companions, but she easily caught the back of his neck and squeezed until her hand gripped tight around his neck bone."
0,Blood seeped from where her hand dug into flesh and dripped down her arm.
0,A little more force and the bone snapped.
0,The soldier’s head hung from the small bit of flesh that could not fit into her grasp.
0,Eydis looked back in the direction Justin fled.
0,No more soldiers would pursue him.
0,"She wanted to chase after, but something in her heart stopped her."
0,I cannot see him.
0,I do not deserve to.
1,She turned her attention to the ongoing slaughter.
0,Some of the soldiers who witnessed her one-sided assault stopped and tried to motion others to focus on the new threat.
0,Most humans of Earth were good people.
0,They did not deserve this.
0,Eydis grabbed a sword from a felled soldier.
0,It felt no heavier than a twig in her hand.
0,"Unlike before, she could not recklessly charge into the fray."
0,There were innocent civilians intermixed with the soldiers.
0,"Instead, she ran with enough presence that many of the nearby soldiers halted their slaughter and changed their focus to her."
0,She chuckled.
0,They were not cowards like that minum.
0,They were willing to die.
0,"The soldiers formed a defensive wall, but Eydis ignored it."
0,She jumped right over and targeted the first spellcaster she saw.
0,She had to look back to see if her swing even made contact.
0,"There was no resistance, almost like slicing air, but the head of the wind mage slid from the woman’s shoulders as she collapsed to the ground."
0,The chaos of the massacre played in Eydis’s favor.
0,Those who could use magic were so preoccupied with the ones they were killing that they did not notice Eydis until their head was on the ground.
0,"The sword grew blunt, but the strength of Eydis’s arm more than compensated."
0,"In truth, she was happier to feel some resistance because she could move onto the next mage or archer without worry of having missed or the soldier surviving."
0,One last swing and all ranged fighters were corpses on the ground.
0,No more innocent people fell prey to Jethro’s army.
0,The only prey was the soldiers now.
0,Eydis’s rampage caught the attention of all remaining soldiers.
0,The surviving citizens did not mistake their opening and fled.
0,Eydis laughed.
0,She reveled in the thrill of finally having a personal hand in stopping Jethro’s plans and killing the human soldiers that had caused so much pain in her world.
0,A circle of armed men formed around her.
0,"Shields took the front with spears in the back, but the faces of the soldiers showed no confidence."
0,They knew as well as Eydis that they had no hope.
0,"An intelligent Lurr was far too fierce an opponent to fight without magic, and only an intelligent Lurr would think to remove all ranged fighters first."
0,"Eydis took a few steps forward, and the circle of soldiers followed to center her in their radius."
0,"Her hand grabbed the metal frame of what looked like a thin, burnt bed."
0,She flung it with all her strength.
0,Not one soldier had time to react.
0,It hit a group of six and sent them flying back in a spray of metal and blood.
0,None of the soldiers moved.
0,None took command or gave orders.
0,Everyone was silent.
0,“Heh.”
0,Eydis raced to the gap and swung her sword.
0,"The shield bearers attempted to block, but one hit with the sword sent their shields awry with enough force to twist and break their arms."
0,"The sword snapped from the force of impact, but she quickly grabbed another from the broken shieldman."
0,The next swing cut them down without resistance.
0,"Spearmen tried to use their reach, but their thrusts were too slow for a Lurr’s eyes."
0,Eydis closed in and dispatched them with ease.
0,"The circle tried to enclose from behind, but Eydis simply jumped to the outside to continue her massacre."
0,"Twenty soldiers dropped to ten, then five, then one."
0,The sole remaining spearman sat on his back looking up at the red-eyed woman dyed in the blood of his comrades.
0,"He pointed his spear at her chest, but she only laughed."
0,“This world is under my protection now.
0,You were foolish to come here.”
0,"The soldier thrust his spear, but Eydis caught it just behind the wings and yanked it from his grip without effort."
0,She then spun it around and stabbed the man in the heart.
0,“Monster…” The man’s eyes grew still.
0,“I am no monster.”
1,Eydis surveyed the carnage.
0,Countless innocents had lost their lives.
0,"In her heart, she wished she could have arrived quicker, but the injuries to her leg and chest, not to mention her inability to teleport due to being out of clean ven, had slowed her down tremendously."
0,"Even now, the pain that had been suppressed by adrenaline returned with full force."
0,"Eydis ran through the complex following the trail of dead bodies to make sure Justin and Sammy were safe, but what she heard from the other side of the complex made her heart sink."
0,A battle was still raging.
0,She let Justin go without even thinking that there were more soldiers elsewhere at the hospital.
0,"The combat hinted that most mages were with the first group she already eliminated, but there was an unfamiliar sound coming from the direction Justin fled."
0,It buzzed like the quick flapping of large wings and was accompanied by the sound of rapid gunfire.
0,This unknown filled Eydis with fear.
0,Justin’s life was in danger.
0,"A familiar sensation from above washed through Eydis’s body, freezing her in place."
0,The fear in her heart heightened to an unbearable sense of dread.
0,"It had been weeks since she last felt it, but the signature was unmistakable."
0,Why did she not realize sooner?
0,"If the army was here, so was their commander."
0,"She looked up in the sky and saw a lone man hovering in the air as if standing on some invisible platform, a barrier."
0,“Jethro…” The name escaped her lips like a phantom.
0,Jethro eyed the destruction of the hospital but soon noticed Eydis.
0,He disappeared from her vision and reappeared in front of her in a flash of light.
0,Fear paralyzed her.
0,She could not speak or breathe.
0,She knew that she had no chance against him.
0,Her ven was poisoned.
0,Even the powerful magic she learned from him was useless.
0,“My dear doppelganger.
0,I am so happy to see you well.”
0,Eydis dropped the sword that once belonged to one of Jethro’s men.
0,Her body was dyed red with their blood.
0,He’s going to kill me.
0,He knows I have been slaughtering his men!
0,The look on Jethro’s face was not anger but unbridled joy.
0,“I want to congratulate you on a job well done!
0,I never expected you to have accomplished so much in your short time here.”
0,Eydis’s mind went blank.
0,"“Truly, the First Princess was a serious cause for worry."
0,I knew none of my men could fight her.
0,Her skill with magic is absurd.
0,I did not know just how skilled she was until I tried to assassinate her.
0,"But you, you did what even I could not!”"
0,No… 
0,"“On your own, you rendered her helpless."
0,"Of course, I did not expect you to kill her."
0,You are an incomplete doppelganger after all.”
0,No… I did not do it for… 
0,"“Without you, this mission never would have worked!"
0,All that is left is to find her.
0,"She is here, is she not?”"
0,Eydis’s eyes unconsciously flicked in the direction she felt the presence of her “prey.” 
0,"Jethro’s well-trained eyes caught the very subtle movement, and Eydis immediately knew she had made a terrible, terrible mistake."
0,"That was where Justin was headed, or perhaps he was already there."
0,“I did not do it for you… I did not mean…”
0,“Of course not.
0,"It was only your instinct after all, but a promise is a promise."
0,I will let you live free in this world.”
0,“No!
0,I wanted to stop you!
0,I wanted to fight you!
0,"After what you did to me, after what you did to Rynn!”"
0,Eydis swung her fist at Jethro but it broke against an invisible wall.
0,The smile disappeared from Jethro’s face as he shook off the numbness from the recoil.
0,Eydis shrunk back.
0,He would not forgive her now.
0,"“I guess you would not want me to take away your prey, but I cannot have you interfering.”"
0,"No… I… If I am gone, he will kill Justin."
0,"Please… “Please… please, do not kill Justin."
0,"You can take Eydis, but please… do not hurt Justin!”"
0,Jethro’s eyes grew wide.
0,This doppelganger was letting her prey go for the safety of another.
0,A faint smile returned to his face.
0,“Is Justin the man who was living with the princess?”
0,Eydis managed a nod.
0,"“If he gets in my way, I may have to kill him.”"
0,Eydis prostrated herself.
0,“I beg you!
0,Anything but him!”
0,Jethro sighed.
0,"“Alright, get up, get up.”"
0,"At his command, Eydis stood, but she kept her head down and eyes closed in submission."
0,"“Our agreement was for you to live in the princess’s place, and that place was with that man, correct?"
0,I will not go back on my word.
0,"I will not kill you, and I will let you live in this world with Justin.”"
0,Relief washed over Eydis.
0,Her body shook and tears welled in her eyes.
0,"“However, I cannot rule out that you will not attempt to cross me.”"
0,Eydis’s breath caught in her throat.
0,Her eyes rose.
0,Jethro’s hand was extended with his palm facing her chest.
0,An incredible force hit Eydis like a high-speed boulder.
0,Jethro immediately shrunk in her vision.
0,She flew backwards and broke through two walls of a hospital building.
0,"“How troublesome,” Jethro sighed."
0,“I hope that was enough to keep her down.
0,"I should probably kill her anyway, but I did make a promise.”"
1,"* * *
Corpses littered the ground, mostly hospital workers and patients."
0,Justin only counted two of the medieval soldiers among them.
0,The traumatic scene slowed them down due to the pure mental and emotional exhaustion.
0,"The hospital complex was not even that large, but the number of dead made the distance between two buildings feel like a mile."
0,"To make the trauma even worse, behind them they heard the massacre escalate, and ahead of them they heard more fighting."
0,People were dying all around them.
0,They held in their nausea and fought to ignore the pungent smell of iron and filth that permeated every square slab of sidewalk or black stretch of asphalt.
0,Twice Justin had to stop and vomit out bile from his empty stomach.
0,He could imagine that his pallor was just as sheet white as Sammy’s and Chloe’s.
0,With every step his legs wanted to give in.
0,He wanted to ball up on the ground and cry.
0,"In his head, he kept on repeating one thing."
0,“I caused all this.”
0,"He never regretted saving Eydis that early morning in November, but Sean was right."
0,He should have contacted the police after learning assassins were after her.
0,"Eydis trusted him to be always with her, but he got lax in his watch allowing Jethro’s men to capture her."
0,"They learned of the university, and Justin couldn’t even begin to guess how many died and how many more will die there."
0,He was the closest to Eydis but never noticed the other Eydis took her place.
0,"Through prolonged abuse, Eydis grew too weak to wake, so they could not properly handle the preliminary attacks on Gullivan in her absence, allowing them to escalate into an invasion."
0,"Because of his own toxic body, the other Eydis became ill and incapable of using magic."
0,"Justin did not know where she was, but he doubted she could stop the attack on Gullivan in her state."
0,She could barely stand when she left his hospital room with Rynn.
0,All his mistakes culminated into the carnage before him.
0,"This was his fault, and disregarding whether that was true or not, he did not have the mental capacity to refute it, not among all this death, not next to the large man sprawled at his feet with his fat and entrails seeping out of the deep gash in his stomach."
0,“Come on.
0,"We need to hurry,” Sammy said."
0,But there are more of them that way!
0,"Sammy’s voice was kind albeit shaken, so Justin could not find within himself to shout his thoughts."
0,She and Chloe each grabbed one of Justin’s hands and pulled him along.
0,"They were far stronger than him in so many ways, and Justin knew he would never make it through this without them."
1,They neared the opposite side of the hospital to where the sound of a helicopter and gunfire originated.
0,They waited behind the corner of one of the buildings.
0,Sammy peeked out with an audible gasp.
0,Chloe and Justin then followed.
0,"A couple hundred yards down the road in front of their destination, two small attack helicopters fired ceaselessly at a group of soldiers."
0,"Soldiers launched a few fireballs and shards of ice in retaliation, but the helicopters were able to avoid most of them from their distance."
0,One of the ice shards hit but shattered on contact with minimum damage.
0,"Most of the soldiers were dead, their corpses littering the road with the vast majority amassing where the current struggle unfolded."
0,"From what Justin saw, the soldiers had not quite reached Eydis."
0,His legs moved with unconscious effort down the road.
0,Sammy called after him but soon followed with Chloe when Justin would not stop.
0,Only a handful of soldiers remained.
0,Two archers released futile arrows and one last mage hurled large spikes of ice like javelins.
0,"The remaining two held as many shields as they could carry to try to defend their ranged comrades, but the guns of the small attack helicopters ripped through one of the shieldmen and the mage behind him."
0,The apparent victory pushed Justin to move faster.
0,One of the helicopters lost its propeller and crashed to the ground.
0,A man in the air disappeared and reappeared in a freefall next to the second helicopter as it tried to make distance.
0,A visible shockwave expanded from the front of the man and crumpled the side of the helicopter.
0,"Pieces of glass and propeller blew outward as if hit by a massive, invisible explosion, and the machine fell from the sky."
0,Justin froze.
0,The remaining three soldiers cheered.
0,A verbal and wide-gestured exchange traded between the man now standing in the air and the soldiers on the ground.
0,He pointed.
0,The soldiers ran towards the nearby single-story hospital wing.
0,Eydis’s room was there.
0,Fear could no longer hold him.
0,"Justin ran, and Sammy and Chloe pleaded in desperation for him to come back."
0,Twice Justin nearly tripped over the ever-increasing corpses.
0,"Sammy tried to reach him and pull him back, but Justin kept running."
0,They were too conspicuous.
0,They would be seen.
0,The man standing in the air vanished and reappeared in front of Justin.
0,He tried to stop but collided with an invisible wall and fell back over the body of a fallen soldier.
0,Justin trembled.
0,He had seen the facial composite created by the fake Eydis.
0,Pure white fear spread through his body and locked his arms and legs.
0,“Do you know a Justin?”
0,"The man’s voice was slow, like he had to think specifically about each English word he spoke."
0,“Jethro…”
0,Jethro smiled and spoke an elated sentence in some unknown language.
0,Sammy and Chloe reached Justin and pulled him away.
0,They were shaking just as much as him.
0,They knew who stood before them.
0,“You are Justin!
0,You are lucked.
0,Lucky?”
0,"Jethro’s manner of speech was reminiscent of Eydis when she was first learning English, but Justin did not have the leisure to feel nostalgic."
0,“A Lurr asked me do not kill you.”
0,Justin knew that Lurr.
0,Another feeling of unease spread through him.
0,"He knew he shouldn’t care about her, but that part of him he hated worried about what happened to the other Eydis."
0,"“But, I must make Eydis FeAmel hurt.” Jethro’s eyes grew narrow."
0,“You three are her friends.
0,I will not kill Justin.
0,I can kill you and you.” 
0,His fingers pointed to Sammy and Chloe.
0,Justin spread his arms to cover Sammy and Chloe and pulled them in behind him.
0,"Jethro vanished with a light crack, and a flash appeared behind them."
0,Time slowed around Justin.
0,A near invisible planar object that split the air extended from Jethro’s downward-swinging hand.
0,Eydis’s assassin could cut anything with magic.
0,He had heard that from Eydis a long time ago.
0,"Justin pulled on Sammy’s coat to move her where he stood and away from the slow moving, near-invisible blade."
0,"The blade missed, and time returned to its normal pace."
0,Chloe was far slower on her reaction and swung a flaming knife-hand behind her.
0,The fire arched out from her swing but stopped against the invisible force.
0,She could not reach Jethro with her magic.
0,"Justin prepared for a second attack, but one did not follow."
0,Jethro looked at Justin with a surprise on his face not unlike the veteran soldier from before.
0,"However, unlike the soldier, Jethro voiced his surprise with a single English word."
0,“Time…”
0,Jethro laughed within himself.
0,"Not only could this boy connected with the princess use time magic, but he could also activate it instantly upon the first appearance of a threat."
0,"Spatial magic usually required time to cast due to the formulas needed to use it efficiently, but it could then be cast instantly once the formula was memorized."
0,Time was different in that a channeling period was required before any time magic could be cast.
0,"Even the channeling radiated ven to signal its use, so one who was sensitive would always be alerted before the time magic activated."
0,One of his former colleagues during his youth was a time mage researching how to remove or shortcut that same channeling time.
0,It was not a magic that could be use instantly.
0,"However, Jethro had gained invaluable knowledge on spatial magic from Emer."
0,Perhaps there were more magical unknowns in this world.
0,His internal laughter escaped as a small chuckle.
0,He felt a small kinship with Justin not unlike what he felt with Emer.
0,This boy could become an unparalleled master of time magic with enough study.
0,“Why are you after Eydis?”
0,Justin’s sudden words broke Jethro out of his introspection.
0,“What crime has she done that would make you come to our world to kill so many people to get to her?!”
0,Pain grew in Jethro’s heart like the slow insertion of a hot knife.
0,Eyes fueled with hatred glared back at Justin.
0,There was no joyful surprise remaining.
0,"Noticing the change in demeanor, Justin once again pulled Sammy and Chloe behind him."
0,Part of Jethro wanted to kill them all and be done.
0,His spatial rejection magic could eliminate them instantly.
0,The doppelganger only survived it twice because she was a Lurr and he was holding back.
0,The Mountain Elf only survived due to her reinforcement magic.
0,"A normal human would be obliterated, and Justin’s time magic would be unable to stop it."
0,But Jethro couldn’t.
0,Losing such a rare time magic prodigy would be a crime.
1,The sound of shattering rock redirected Jethro’s attention down the road.
0,The archer that Jethro sent to search the building for the princess flew back onto the street and crumbled into an unmoving heap.
0,A terribly injured Mountain Elf limped out onto the road.
0,"He recognized the escaped slave that he had used for his transmission experiment, the one that survived his spatial rejection magic."
0,The shieldman and final archer were missing and had likely fallen to her as well.
0,Behind the Mountain Elf another battered woman walked out of the structure.
0,"Finally, a taller man exited supporting an elven woman with her arm over his shoulder, the First Princess, Eydis FeAmel."
0,She noticed Jethro and those who stood near him.
0,"The strength in her legs gave out, and she began sobbing."
0,“Eydis! Run!” 
0,Justin’s shout confirmed Jethro’s suspicion.
0,He erected a barrier around the princess and those with her.
0,He reinforced it with an anti-teleportation encryption so she could not escape.
0,The Mountain Elf hammered at the barrier with her fists and then a stone baton.
0,The damage was so insignificant that Jethro could not feel any recoil.
0,"She placed her hand on the barrier, but the pulse that had shattered his barrier once in the past barely registered as what he could consider recoil."
0,That elf was barely holding onto life.
0,She would not be a threat.
0,The stage was set.
0,The princess would now watch as those that she loved suffered because of her.
0,A flick of Jethro’s wrist sent a small barrier flying at the orange-haired woman’s head.
0,Justin noticed it at the last conceivable moment and shifted her away.
0,"The small blade only sliced a small lock of hair and continued on until it dissipated, but Justin’s movements left the shorter woman open."
0,Jethro launched a larger barrier at the unguarded woman.
0,The panic on Justin’s face pleased Jethro.
0,Justin kicked the woman.
0,She jolted to the side and fell to the ground.
0,Justin barely retracted his foot before the barrier could sever it at the ankle.
0,Jethro’s barriers were too slow against a time mage.
0,He reached to his waist and removed the small handgun.
0,"His aim was not perfect, but at this distance he could not miss."
0,He aimed at the fallen girl and fired.
0,Justin consciously slowed time the moment Jethro drew the gun.
0,He dove for Sammy.
0,The bullet travelled at an incredible speed even in his slow world.
0,Justin had no control over where the bullet hit.
0,He could feel it break the skin of his abdomen and tear the muscle.
0,He felt the snap of each individual fiber and tissue until the bullet stopped.
0,"When time resumed its pace, he landed on top of Sammy with a white-hot burning in his stomach."
0,““Justin!””
0,Screams rose from both Sammy and the princess in the distance.
0,It all happened in an instant to those who saw.
0,The reflexes and response were so inhuman that it was enough to make Jethro pause in admiration.
0,"“Oh, God.” "
0,The woman Justin saved sat up and pressed her hand on Justin’s stomach to stop the bleeding.
0,She glared at Jethro with fear and anger.
0,Jethro could only laugh despite himself.
0,He realized his own stupidity.
0,“I cannot believe I did not do this first…”
0,"He extended his hand, and a barrier formed around Justin and held him in place."
0,"The woman tried to move him and cover the wound, but the boy’s blood spilled out inside the barrier uninhibited."
0,"Fire from the red headed woman assaulted Jethro, but it could not touch him through his barrier."
0,“Stop this!
0,"Please,” the short woman cried."
0,“Why are you doing this?!”
0,"Jethro did not answer, but the plea of the woman holding Justin gave him an idea."
0,"He looked into the tear-filled, distressed eyes of the time mage."
0,“Do you want to know why I hate Amel?
0,Why I hate Eydis?”
0,Changing the destination coordinates of his transmission spell was not difficult now that he had two partnered formulas with inverted coordinates.
0,He knew precisely where the two worlds were in relation to each other.
0,Jethro modified the return formula Emer created and targeted a specific room in the home of one if his associates in Tolmyur.
0,Jethro extended his hand.
1,“Justin… no… Justin…”
0,Eydis crawled up the street with her body broken and battered from Jethro’s magic.
0,The spell was far more powerful than the first time he used it on her after her fight with the Alukah.
0,She fought through the intense pain and exhaustion to chase after the man she loved only to watch Jethro shoot him.
0,"Jethro did not keep his promise, and deep down, Eydis hoped he would, because Jethro never lied."
0,"But, she was too late."
0,Now Jethro had his hand extended in a hostile gesture she knew would end Justin’s life.
0,All she could think of was the magic Jethro used against her.
0,"Justin, Sammy, and Chloe would not survive like she did."
0,They were not Lurr.
0,Nothing would remain.
0,She extended her hand and forced her toxic ven through.
0,Her body rebelled in a wave of burning pain throughout her entire body that surpassed the damage she had already taken and overpowered the adrenaline trying to keep her pain in check.
0,"Still, she pushed further to create a barrier that would save their life."
0,Her vision grew hazy.
0,Her nausea caused irrepressible vomiting.
0,Her body felt as if all the blood that flowed through it was replaced by a powerful acid that melted her from the inside.
0,Her consciousness was slipping.
0,"When she could endure the pain no longer, she cast the barrier and whited out for but a moment."
1,Jethro cast the transmission.
0,A tiny woman no larger than his hand appeared and touched the back of his hand with her fingers.
0,"He could feel an alteration in the makeup of the transmission formula as it cast, but it happened so fast that he could not tell what changed."
0,All he felt was the sensation of his spatial magic mixing with another’s.
0,"After a strong suction that pulled the bodies that littered the ground towards it and threatened to pull him in, not only Justin but also the two women with him vanished."
0,"In desperation, Jethro used the strongest spatial rejection spell he could on the small feminine figure before the suction finished."
0,"The entire area in front of him blew away in an immense cloud of dirt, rock, and gore from the many bodies that were pulled into the empty space left by the transmission."
1,Lurr Eydis’s eyes regained focus in time to watch the massive explosion where the bodies of her three friends once stood.
0,"Rocks, metal, and pieces of flesh peppered the road and fell on Eydis, but she did not blink until the light breeze removed the dust."
0,Her heart sunk into a pit of dread and sorrow.
0,Nothing remained in front of Jethro.
0,Her barrier did not hold.
0,"Justin, Sammy, and Chloe were gone."
0,The blood and pieces of flesh that fell on her could have been the remnants of her friends.
0,No words came from her mouth.
0,No thoughts entered her mind.
0,Only tears welled and fell from her eyes as the distant cries of the other Eydis sounded over the destroyed roadway.
0,"In her immense sorrow and guilt of her failure to save the man she loved and the friends she held most dear, Eydis succumbed to the pain and exhaustion in her body and lost consciousness."
1,“Justin!
0,Justin!”
0,Princess Eydis flailed in Sean’s arms.
0,She kept calling Justin’s name as if Sammy and Chloe had not been caught in the same explosion.
0,He struggled to keep her light frame from running after the man who had killed their friends.
0,"“Eydis…” Sean fought back his own sorrow and anger to try and calm her down, but she was inconsolable."
0,“Let go!
0,Justin!”
0,Sean held Eydis tight.
0,Her arm flailed about and clawed at the air.
0,“Eydis!” He shouted at her.
0,"Something locked around Sean’s foot and before he knew what happened, he was on his back on the ground."
0,He managed to grab Eydis’s ankle before she could run.
0,She looked back at him with seething wrath.
0,A wind spear grew in her hands.
0,"Fear spread through every corner of his body, but he did not let go."
0,He had to trust that she would not attack him.
0,"Behind Eydis, Sean saw Jethro turn to face them."
0,“Justin’s gone!
0,They’re gone!” Sean screamed.
0,The spear dispersed as the pain of loss contorted Eydis’s face in anguish.
0,“No… Justin.”
0,“We need to leave.” Miriam said.
0,“No.
0,No!” Eydis would not listen.
0,Miriam slapped Eydis hard across the face and grabbed the front of her hospital gown.
0,“You are the only one who can teleport us away from here!
0,Do you want us to die too?!”
0,“I do not care about you!
0,I want Justin!”
0,Sean realized something was wrong with Eydis.
0,She was not in her right mind.
0,They couldn’t escape like this.
0,Eydis felt like the most important part of her had been stolen away.
0,The large void in her heart filled rapidly with anguish and fury.
0,"She wanted to kill the man who stole that most important part from her, who took Justin away from her."
0,"Now, these two humans were trying to stop her."
0,"They had protected her, and she felt like she knew them intimately, but she could not remember who they were, only that they were stopping her."
0,The Mountain Elf accompanying them knelt and bowed her head.
0,"“My Lady, I beseech you!"
0,Stop this foolishness.
0,You are the sole heir to the Amelian Empire.
0,"Your life matters more than any of us, even Justin."
0,We must flee!
0,You can only get revenge on Tolmyur if you survive.”
0,That… I… That is right.
0,"I am Eydis FeAmel, First Princess of the Amelian Empire."
0,Eydis did not know how she had forgotten such an important piece of herself.
0,"Her heart yearned for Justin, the one who took her in, protected her, and supported her."
0,She loved him with all her heart.
0,"Her longing for him was all that occupied her long imprisonment in the dark caverns of her mind, but the man was right."
0,The Mountain Elf was right.
0,Justin was gone.
0,She witnessed the bloody explosion that not even the pavement of the road endured.
0,"But if she had the power of an entire empire on her side, she could have revenge."
0,"She reluctantly nodded her head, shamefaced."
0,“We must retreat.”
0,Eydis worked out a teleportation formula.
0,"She did not know where to go, but anywhere other than the city would be safe."
0,She reached out and tore open a portal in space in front of her.
1,Jethro fumed with anger.
0,He pounded on the barrier around him.
0,Every attempt to cut it failed.
0,"He tried reading the flow of the spatial ven to find a way to dispel it, but it was of such an impossible complexity that he could not even begin to understand it."
0,"Somehow, the barrier he had placed around himself was repurposed without his knowledge the moment he turned to attack the princess."
0,"Worst of all, the barrier around the princess had vanished, and she was teleporting away."
0,The small womanly figure floated at face level in front of Jethro just outside the barrier.
0,"“I am sorry, but both you and Eydis FeAmel have a much greater role to play than revenge, so I am compelled to restrain your hand."
0,I ask that you discontinue your plans to invade this world.
0,We cannot have you angering Kalya and force her into action.
0,"However, feel free to continue your vendetta against Amel on Whinhlem."
0,"We will not stop you, but I will have to hold you here for a time.”"
0,"The small woman appeared inside the barrier, placed her hand on his forehead, and sent a pulse through his body."
0,She then reappeared outside the barrier and gave a cheerful wave before Jethro could retaliate.
0,"“Until we meet again, Bridge between Worlds.”"
0,The figure flew away and entered the portal created by the princess just before it closed.
0,"The moment she disappeared, the barrier around Jethro vanished."
0,"Epilogue
“The Aftermath”"
1,Colonel Richards sat back in his chair.
0,His complexion was sickly from both bewilderment and lack of sleep.
0,Over 5000 civilians lost their lives in the assault on the city and tens of thousands more were injured.
0,"The commander of the enemy forces, Jethro, had been reported at the hospital by the two AH-6 Little Birds before they were promptly destroyed."
0,"The Apache dispatched to aid the battle on the north side of the city was sent back to intercept, but Jethro was gone, and no more sightings followed."
0,The citizens had repelled those attacking the southeast.
0,Those attacking the hospital had been killed by the attack helicopters and the work of various individuals.
0,"By the time the ground forces arrived, the police of the nearest cities had been able to suppress most of the invaders."
0,The army was repurposed to disaster relief and the search for survivors in the devastated northern quarter of the city.
0,"Regrettably, there was not one survivor among Gullivan’s on-duty police."
0,"Of the entire enemy army that invaded, only two soldiers survived."
0,One was a giant of a man and the second an elderly woman whom he protected.
0,They were currently imprisoned and did not show any hostility after capture.
0,"There was no word yet on what to do with them, but Colonel Richards assumed that they would receive capital punishment after questioning."
0,"Among the group of youth who had knowledge about the invaders, only half of them survived the attack including the elven princess who was the target of the invading army."
0,They were discovered walking along the highway fifteen miles south of the city and somehow gained a new elf companion.
0,They were now residing at Fort Samper for better protection.
0,“She should have been taken there from the start.”
0,Colonel Richards wiped his hand down his face.
0,He had a feeling that he had been doing this more over the past two weeks than he had his entire military career.
0,"When he first saw Sean and Miriam, they were utterly distraught."
0,"After discussing what happened at the hospital, he learned that they witnessed the gruesome death of Sammy Thompson, Chloe Hearn, and the one most involved with the elven princess, Justin Hapfeld."
0,The Mountain Elf was a subject of the princess and was only relieved that Eydis was alive.
0,Eydis on the other hand was possessed by an anger that threatened to lash out at the slightest provocation.
0,"The moment she arrived at Fort Samper, she demanded they ally with her to defeat their common enemy."
0,"In return, she would teach the soldiers magic."
0,Her request was denied until a formal decision could be made at the federal level.
0,“Magic…”
0,That was the most bizarre part of these events.
0,The invaders were not from some far away hidden village or city.
0,Sean was upfront about the truth.
0,They came from another world or dimension using teleportation magic.
0,"Magic was real, and no doubt the world would soon find out."
0,"There were many skeptics, but the sheer number of personal accounts and videos of the assault on the city created proof that was impossible to hide."
0,"Even now, all branches of the federal government were requesting to meet Colonel Richards."
0,No press briefing had been held yet because nothing had been decided on what to say or what could be said.
0,This only fueled the conspiracy theorists trying to piece together the truth.
0,"Before any decisions could be made, Colonel Richards wanted input from the last survivor personally involved with not only the princess but also the enemy commander, the imposter Eydis FeAmel."
0,A tired looking medical staff entered the room.
0,The clock on the wall read 3:13am.
0,"“Sir, she’s awake.”"
0,"The moment Colonel Richards learned the imposter Eydis’s health improved and that she could wake, he rushed to visit her."
0,This was the second day of mulling over the events that transpired while waiting for her to wake.
0,He ignored orders and requests and remained at the hospital because he could not afford to miss the moment she woke.
0,He cared little about whatever punishment would come for him later.
0,She was far more important.
0,"He rushed behind the doctor to the neighboring room, but the moment he stepped in the door and met eyes with the imposter Eydis, the writhing woman vanished with a loud crack."
0,Colonel Richards wiped his hand down his face.
0,“What else did I expect…?”
0,At least she was not an enemy to the people of this world.
0,Or at least he was fairly sure.
0,"According to eyewitness accounts at the hospital, she had single-handedly killed half the attacking army in order to help the survivors escape."
0,"To him, anyone who was willing to fight themselves to a state near death in order to save lives was a hero."
0,"To be continued in:
Declaration of War
