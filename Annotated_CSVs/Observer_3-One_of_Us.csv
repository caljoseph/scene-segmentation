1,Autumn leaves kicked up into the air as my feet shuffled along a tree-lined road.
0,"The change in seasons had colored the landscape in bright oranges and yellows, but much to my relief, the weather had remained rather warm."
0,"With summer behind me, I was once again dreading the approaching winter."
0,"However, should the warm weather persist, this country would be a good place to stay."
0,"“Hello young one,” a man called as he passed me, ending my contemplation."
0,I had to think for a moment to understand what he said.
0,His accent was one I had never heard before.
0,It overstressed the ‘e’ in “hello” but the ‘o’ on “hello” and “one” were almost skipped entirely.
0,"I nodded back at the man, and he continued walking down the road."
1,"Not more than a mile down the road, I saw someone who looked exactly like the former man."
0,"He wore the same finely woven brown pants, white shirt, and light blue vest."
0,"“Hello young one,” the man repeated in the exact same accent."
0,This time I stopped.
0,I was positive I had crossed this man going the other way.
0,"To prove to myself I was not crazy, I asked."
0,"“Did I see you before, further up the road?”"
0,"“Don’t think so,” the man replied."
0,“But people do say I have a rather common face.”
0,"Even though it was not his face to which I was referring, I did not want to press it."
0,"If he said that he was not the same person, I did not want to argue."
0,To argue it was to argue my sanity.
0,"Once the man was behind me, I made a mental note to find somewhere to rest."
0,"To calm my mind, I followed the road looking at the colored scenery beside me."
0,“Hello young one.”
0,"I looked at the man beside me, and without even acknowledging him, I looked back behind me down the road."
0,"The former man had not even left my view and yet here he was again, same accent, same clothing, same height, build, everything."
0,I had to sit down.
0,What sorcery had I fallen under?
0,“You look tired young one.
0,Travel far?” the man asked.
0,"I nodded, still unsure whether or not he was an apparition."
0,"“Fortunate for you, there is a town not far in the direction you are headed."
0,You should stop there and rest yourself.”
0,I nodded again.
0,“Who’s the young one?”
0,Another man walked up to us.
0,This was too much.
0,The two men were identical in every way and the same as the two men I had passed.
0,“Is he ill?” the man asked.
0,“That does look like blood on his clothes.
0,Maybe he’s hurt.”
0,"“Are you hurt, young one?” the former man asked, but I remained silent."
0,The two men looked at each other as if looking in a mirror.
0,"“I’ll take him back to town,” the latter man said, pulling me up by my arm."
0,"“Good man,” the former said before continuing down the road."
0,"“I know you would have done the same,” the latter replied."
0,"Not wanting to question the exchange or what I was seeing, I went along with the man."
0,"As we walked, he questioned me about what happened to me, where I was from, and where, if anywhere, I was going, but I never answered."
0,I only stared at the copies of the man passing us from time to time.
0,"The more I saw, the more I realized that there were subtle differences in height, body shape, and hair color, but they were too similar for me to distinguish one person from another, my inability to see faces ever complicating the issue."
1,"After walking for another hour, we came upon the entrance to a town."
0,What I saw rid me of my breath.
0,Every man wore the same outfit and the women a long light brown skirt instead of the pants with a light green vest over their white shirt.
0,"Not only were the people identical in every way, both sides of the street were mirrors of the other."
0,Even the buildings were built in the exact same manner.
0,"The man led me down the street, and once we turned the first corner, I lost all orientation."
0,I could not understand how the residents knew where to go.
0,"This new street looked exactly like the one I had just been in, down to the very buildings."
1,I was led to the third building down on the right.
0,The man opened the door and nudged me in.
0,"""Ma'am, you have a visitor,"" he called."
0,"An elderly women, who was also dressed like all the others, approached, and the man bade me farewell stating he had business out of town."
0,"""Who do we have here?"""
0,the woman asked.
0,She then looked at my blood stained clothes.
0,"""That must be why he brought you here."
0,"What happened?"""
0,"""Nothing,"" I said."
0,"""It was a long time ago."""
0,"""If you're not hurt, why did he bring you to a healer?"""
0,the woman asked.
0,"""I might as well take a look."""
0,The elderly woman kneeled in front of me and lifted my shirt.
0,The mark on my stomach had long since healed.
0,No scar remained; none ever had.
0,"""You look healthy."
0,"You must have lost a lot of blood to make a stain that large, but there is no scar."
0,"Unless,"" she got to her feet, ""it was not your blood."""
0,The lady stepped back and brought her hand to her chest.
0,"""Was someone trying to hurt you and you fought back, or worse, was it a loved one?"
0,Is that why you are alone?
0,You poor thing!
0,You must have seen something traumatic.
0,"Come here and sit down."""
0,The healer pulled me to a padded bench and had me lay down.
0,"""I'm not just a healer of the body, but also the mind,"" she explained."
0,"Pulling over a stool, she set a small bowl on it and added a few spices and dried plants."
0,"""I can't take medicine,"" I tried to explain."
0,"""Young one, this is not to drink."
0,"You would make yourself sick."""
0,The healer then grabbed a rock of flint and truck a spark into the bowl.
0,"As the mixture smoked, she fanned the pleasant but odd fragrance over my face."
0,"My head began to spin, so I laid it back on the bench."
1,"When I awoke, I was tucked into a bed in a small room with a window across from me."
0,"My head still felt light when I sat up, but I also felt calm."
0,"I did not know where I was or what happened, but that did not seem to bother me."
0,I pulled the blanket off me and saw I was naked.
0,"Beside the bed was a new set of clothing, the same as the other men in the village, but my size."
0,"Not wanting to lose the clothes Hazel and Alfred gave me, I left my room in search of them."
1,The door opened into the entrance where the healer and another customer were talking.
0,The man startled at my sudden appearance.
0,"""Oh, you are awake,"" the healer said."
0,"""Do not mind the young one,"" she told her customer."
0,"""He has been through a lot."""
0,The customer bought a small bag of medicine and left the shop.
0,The healer then turned to me.
0,"""I left clothes out for you,"" she said."
0,"""The ones you were wearing were not only bloodstained, but dirty and torn."""
0,“Do you still have them?” I asked.
0,"“I am not the type to throw away something belonging to someone else, especially when it was given to you by loved ones who are no longer alive, but it would be better for you to rid yourself of attachments to your tragic past.”"
0,“How did you know the people who gave me the clothes died?” I asked.
0,“Get dressed and I’ll explain.”
0,I walked back into the room and dressed myself.
0,"When I walked out, the healer had a small plate with bread and an apple on it set out for me."
0,I grabbed the apple and sat down on the bench.
0,“What did you do to me?” I asked the healer.
0,The healer sat down on a stool.
0,"“Opened your mind,” she replied."
0,“The smoke you breathed in relaxed you enough for you to say what needed to be said.”
0,I did not like the idea that simple smoke would reveal all my secrets to the world.
0,It made me nervous.
0,“What did you find out?”
0,"“Only what you were willing to say, young one."
0,"It calms you enough to speak, but if you do not want to, you will not."
0,"I first asked where you came from, but you did not remember, then your name, and you did not know that either."
0,It is rare to see memory loss as severe as yours.”
0,"“That couldn’t have been all,” I said, remembering that she knew about my clothes."
0,“I asked what the blood was from.
0,You said something along the lines of injuring someone in a duel over a blanket.
0,"You then explained why it was so important, and I knew I was getting closer to your underlining problems."
0,"You do not warm up to people, but not because you do not trust them, but more because you fear yourself.”"
0,I sat silent.
0,What the healer said was correct.
0,It was unsettling.
0,I held the apple up to my nose and closed my eyes to let the sweet aroma calm myself down.
0,"“That was something else you mentioned; your like of apples,” the healer said."
0,"“Throughout our discussion, you kept saying you were hungry, so I thought I would give you something when you woke up.”"
0,"“Thank you, but I can’t eat it,” I said."
0,"“But are you not hungry?” she asked, perplexed."
0,"“I am,” I replied."
0,"“I always am, so much it hurts.” I lowered the apple and gripped it in my hands."
0,“But I can’t eat anything.
0,My body won’t let me.” 
0,The apple shattered in my grip sending pieces to the floor.
0,I took a breath to calm myself and picked up the pieces.
0,The healer held out the plate for me to set them on.
0,"Not wanting to cause more trouble or hear more of what the healer learned about me, I walked to the door."
0,“Were you not looking for a place to stay for winter?” the healer asked.
0,Just how much did she learn from me?
0,“We would love to have you.
0,"I already made arrangements for a guide to accompany you as you learn about our policies,” the healer explained."
0,“He will be here later this morning should you wish to meet him.”
0,The promise of a place to stay for winter was hard to pass up.
0,"After leaving the cottage on the hill, I was forced to sleep outside in the bitter cold waking up to being half dead and covered in frost."
0,I did not want to go through that again.
0,“Will you really let me stay?” I asked.
0,"“Of course, young one."
0,We do not turn anyone away as long as they make an effort to follow our customs.
0,It is part of who we are.
0,"Now, I suggest you continue to rest until you no longer feel faint."
0,The effect of the incense should not have fully ebbed yet.
0,The food is also here if you choose to eat it.”
0,I returned to the bed a laid down.
0,"I did not feel faint, but I was not going to argue."
0,"If I could have shelter for the winter, staying to learn their customs was worth it."
1,"Over the course of the morning, I never slept, but the healer still came in to check on me and offer me food again."
0,"I was unsure if she understood what I had said about me being unable to eat, but I was grateful for the kind gesture."
0,"By mid day, the man who was to be my guide arrived, so the healer called me back into the shop."
0,"“This is Neil,” she explained."
0,“He will be your guide to learning what is needed to live in Ceanna.”
0,"“I do not plan on living here long term,” I said."
0,"“Even so,” Neil spoke up, “there are many things you need to know in order to be accepted here.”"
0,“Does that include everyone looking the same?” I asked.
0,“That is part of it.
0,"If you are ready, I can give you a tour of the town.”"
0,I nodded and walked to the door.
0,"“You will need to put on shoes,” Neil replied."
0,"“Everyone else is wearing them, and you cannot be seen as different.”"
0,"“I had a pair next to where I set the clothes,” the healer explained."
0,I ran back to the room and saw a pair of soft leather boots.
0,After slipping them on I walked to the door.
0,"I did not like shoes, but these were comfortable."
0,"Assuming I did not have to walk long distances in them, I was sure that there would be no problem."
1,We left the healer’s shop into the disorienting street.
0,Again my mind was overloaded with duplicated people walking to and from duplicated houses.
0,I stuck close to Neil for fear of losing him in the crowd.
0,Even he was impossible to distinguish from another man passing us.
0,"Neil had no distinguishing physique, no visible characteristics that would tell him apart from the others."
0,His height was average.
0,His hair color was the same light brown as everyone else who had not succumbed the graying of age.
0,He was also thin like everyone else.
0,"Throwing together the fact that everyone wore the same clothing, every tactic I had to learn to tell one person from another was now useless."
0,"That was, except for how they acted."
0,I made certain to observe every small action Neil made in the hope that I could find something unique about him.
0,"“We will start off with a tour of the Ceanna,” Neil announced."
0,"Neil led me down the road and pointed out various shops, parlors, and the homes of people he knew."
0,"The streets were built into a grid, each with five buildings on the side of each square."
0,"With multiple streets and every home being identical, buy the fifth turn, I had become unmistakably lost."
0,I doubted I could find my way back to the healer if I tried.
0,"""How do you know your way around?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""What do you mean?"""
0,Neil asked back.
0,"""I mean, everything looks the same."
0,"Every street and building is like any other."""
0,"""Look over there,"" Neil said, pointing to a tower in the distance."
0,The tower stood high above the homes which made me wonder why I had not noticed it.
0,At the top of the tower was what looked like a weather vane but immobile.
0,"I was not able to make out the figure, but it seemed to point in one direction."
0,"""Locals never have a problem, but we are not ignorant to how our town may be confusing to outsiders."
0,We built that tower on top the city court in the center of town so that there is no place in town it is not visible.
0,"Using it, you can not only see how close you are to the center of town, but also which side of the town you are in."""
0,"""Very considerate,"" I complimented."
0,"""Maybe so, but there are many that do not like it."
0,"It was almost not passed in council."""
0,"""Why?"""
0,"""It's different."
0,There is nothing else like it in town.
0,"The argument was that if there was to be this tower on top a building, all buildings would need to have towers."
0,"It only passed when someone proposed placing it on top the court in the center of town so that the symmetricity of the town may be preserved."""
0,"""Why were people so adamant about something as small as the town being symmetrical?"""
0,Neil grabbed my shoulder and brought his face close to mine.
0,"""Never speak like that again,"" he warned."
0,"""The town being symmetrical is no small matter."
0,"You will make people angry if you continue like that."""
0,Neil's seriousness silenced any questions I had.
0,"If he was so adamant about it, I should just follow."
0,It must have had some deep cultural significance of which I was unaware.
0,"""I apologize,"" I said."
0,"""No, I am sorry for being so forward about it,"" Neil replied."
0,"""Shall we continue?"""
0,I nodded.
0,"We continued through the town, and I made sure to take glanced at the tower to help learn to orient myself."
1,"By mid afternoon, Neil had us stop at a small public diner."
0,"Despite my attempts to dissuade him, he bought supper for me."
0,The platter came with an even portion of red meat and boiled greens.
0,"When I looked around me, everyone had the same meal and were eating it the exact same way."
0,They cut a small portion of the meat and stuck it with the two pronged fork.
0,"In an eerie synchronicity, the entire diner lifted the piece of meat into their mouth at once."
0,"They then did the same with the boiled greens, spinning it in their fork and bringing it to their mouth."
0,"""Amazing,"" I said."
0,"""What is?"""
0,Neil asked.
0,"""How you eat,"" I replied."
0,"""How I eat?"
0,"Do people in other towns eat differently that I do?"""
0,"Seeing that Neil was not understanding, I did not speak further."
0,I was not sure if the people even knew that they were in sync.
0,"""Are you going to eat?"""
0,Neil asked.
0,I shook my head.
0,"""Sorry, but no."""
0,"""Are you sure?"""
0,I nodded again.
0,Neil waved over a man who had just entered the diner.
0,"""Here."""
0,He handed the man my platter.
0,"""Free of charge."""
0,The man thanked him and sat at an empty table.
0,"""That was kind of you,"" I said."
0,"""I did not buy it for myself, so who eats it is of no consequence to me."
0,"If not for you, then someone else."""
1,"By sunset, Neil had shown me most of the town, but even when watching the tower in the center of town, I was still unsure about where I was."
0,It was only with Neil's help that I was able to return to the healer's home.
0,"""How was your day, young one?"""
0,"the healer asked, after Neil had bid farewell."
0,"""Revelating,"" I said."
0,"""This town is so foreign to me."""
0,"""Most feel that way at first, but once you get used to it, living here becomes second nature,"" she said."
0,"""Do you think that you will want to stay the winter?"""
0,"""With how kind the people are, I see no reason why not."
0,"It will just take some getting used to."""
0,"""Then you will need a little training."""
0,"""Training?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Education to help you become more accepted."
0,"We know that those passing through will not understand our culture, but in order to stay for any period of time, we ask that they make their best effort to become one of us to keep order."
0,"I will instruct Neil to take you to the school tomorrow."""
0,The next morning a man arrived at the door.
0,"I assumed it was Neil, but when I greeted him as such, he said I was mistaken."
0,"The healer corrected me, saying it was one of her regular customers and that I had met him the day before."
0,She handed the man a small sack of medicine and he walked out.
0,"In my embarrassment, I returned to my room."
0,This town would surely take time to grow accustomed to.
1,"Later that morning, a man knocked and walked into my room."
0,"""Ready for school?"""
0,He asked.
0,"""Neil?"""
0,I had to make certain before continuing on with the assumption it was Neil.
0,"""Forgot me already?"""
0,he asked playfully.
0,"""No,"" I replied."
0,"""It's just…"" I cut myself off."
0,I did not think it wise to say he looked like everyone else.
0,"It sounded too much like an insult, and he had been too kind to me the day before."
0,"""No matter,"" Neil said."
0,"""We need to leave if you do not want to be late."""
1,"I walked with Neil outside and he led me across town, past the court in the center, to a seemingly normal building."
0,"After knocking, a lady opened the door."
0,"As expected, she was dressed the same as every other girl in the town."
0,"""Is this our new arrival?"""
0,she asked Neil.
0,"""Yes madam,"" Neil replied."
0,"""He is a little shy, so be sure to treat him well."""
0,"""What do you take me for?"""
0,the instructor laughed.
0,"""He will be sure to feel welcome here."""
0,Neil bid me farewell as the instructor brought me inside.
1,"This building, though same as all the others on the outside, consisted of only one room with rows of benches lined up the center."
0,"On them sat half a dozen children, but there were also two adults, possibly here for the same reason I was."
0,The lady led me to the bench where the two adults sat.
0,"Once I was seated, she moved to the front of the room."
0,"""Rise,"" she ordered."
0,"At once, everyone stood up, and the instructor observed us with great scrutiny."
0,"When all were standing, she picked up a small wooden rod from the table and walked to each child starting with the front left with the rod held behind her back."
0,She nodded in approval for the first two.
0,"""You stood too slow,"" she said to the third child."
0,"""You do not want to stand out, do you?"""
0,The child shook her head.
0,"""Good."
0,"Work on it."""
0,"She gave the fourth a nod, but stopped at the fifth."
0,She pressed her rod on his lower back and straightened his shoulders to keep him from slouching.
0,"Once his posture was like the other children, she gave him a nod."
0,"Knowing that the instructor would be coming to me eventually, I did my best to mimic the posture of the children in front of me."
0,"""And you stood up too fast,"" she said to the sixth child."
0,"""I was excited,"" the boy replied."
0,"""There is nothing wrong with being excited,"" the instructor said."
0,"""We all are at one point or another, but make sure to control it."
0,"From where I was standing, I noticed you the most."
0,"Is that fair to the others in the class?"""
0,"""No…"" the boy replied."
0,"""That is right."
0,"Everyone deserved equal attention."""
0,The instructor then moved to the first adult.
0,"""You are rather harsh on the children,"" the man told her."
0,"""Did I do anything that looked overbearing?"""
0,the instructor asked looking at me.
0,I shook my head.
0,She then turned back to the man.
0,"""See?"
0,"Now, I am not one to insult your culture or way of life, so out of respect, I humbly ask the same of you."
0,"Should you desire to say here, and being in this room tells me you do, you will need to learn to conform to our way of life."
0,"If I have made myself clear, say yes madam."
0,"If not, feel free to ask what is on your mind."""
0,"""Yes madam,"" the man replied, although his tone was not serious."
0,The instructor then moved to the next man and nodded.
0,It was clear that this was not his first lesson.
0,He was indistinguishable from any other person I saw out on the street.
0,"For all I knew, it could have very well been Neil standing next to me."
0,It was then my turn.
0,The instructor stood in front of me and stared.
0,"""Your posture changed from how you were standing before."
0,You are trying to fit in.
0,Well done.
0,"As far as being in sync with everyone, that will come in time."""
0,"Using two fingers, the instructor pushed my shoulders back a little."
0,"""Good."
0,"Remember how standing like that feels."""
0,"Once finished with me, she walked to the front of the class and instructed us to sit."
0,"I made extra effort to sit at the same speed as the other children, but the man who had questioned the instructor took his own time."
0,The instructor then moved on to general education such as simple arithmetic and reading.
0,The man next to me seemed to struggle with this.
0,"Addition took him longer than any of the children, and he was not even able to put two letters together to make an intelligible word."
1,"During a short recess from studies, a question floated on my mind, so I asked him."
0,"""Are you actually a citizen here?"""
0,"""I am,"" the man replied with a smile."
0,His accent was much weaker than everyone else.
0,"""A month ago I was not."
0,I was looking for a home and found this city.
0,It only took a few weeks to get used to it.
0,The village healer helped.
0,I still come to the school because I had no book learning growing up.
0,Not many places do.
0,Free education is something that attracted me.
0,"That and the fact that I can be seen as an equal, not lower than anyone else."""
0,"""But you can't be seen as better than anyone either,"" the other man said as he stood listening into our conversation."
0,"""People here are so stiff."
0,"They live like everyone is tied to strings held by some societal puppeteer, and if anyone moves out of place, they'd all knot up."""
0,He paused for a moment.
0,"""I'm sorry, was that too hard for you to understand?"""
0,"""If you don't like it, why are you still here?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""For fun,"" he replied before sitting silent back on the bench."
0,"""I'm a sellsword who just happened to stumble onto this village."
0,"I have no plans of staying here."""
1,"When the instructor returned, everyone took their seats."
0,"We were instructed to stand again, and she went over everyone as she did before."
0,"This time, the carefree man acted his part and received a nod from the teacher."
0,"""See,"" the sellsword said when she passed to the man beside me."
0,"""I can do it too."""
0,"""Attitude stets you apart the same as your actions,"" the instructor said."
0,"""If you want to fit into this society, you must control that as well."
0,"You will only make enemies otherwise."""
0,The man chuckled at the instructor's remark as she passed the remaining two of us with a nod.
0,The remainder of the class was focused on mannerisms to help us meld into society.
0,The first was how we were supposed to walk.
0,She first demonstrated how the women of the town were to walk.
0,Her feet stepped light in front of each other as if on a straight line.
0,Her hips swiveled lightly and her arm followed counter to her steps.
0,She then told the two girls to go to the front of the class and demonstrate it.
0,The younger of the girls matched the walk perfectly while the other had trouble with her balance.
0,"By the look of it, her left foot was a little lame."
0,"The instructor told her to repeat the walk again and again with the admonition that she must improve, but for the girl, it was simply not possible."
0,"Once almost in tears, the instructor told her to sit down after she made the girl promise to practice on her own."
0,"""Heartless,"" the sellsword mumbled."
0,The instructor then demonstrated how the men were to walk.
0,"Her steps were shoulder width apart and brisk with her back strait and arms slightly bent, following counter to the movement of her feet."
0,"I thought to bring up that the men I saw outside never looked that stiff when they walked, but I figured that it was only for the sake of instruction that she exaggerated it, not being a man herself."
0,The instructor then brought the boys to the front of the class one by one to demonstrate the walk.
0,"In general, the boys had a harder time walking to the level of perfection the instructor wanted."
0,Each boy was sent back to the bench after three tries with the boys promising to practice.
0,None of them were put on display to the same degree as the girl with the lame foot.
0,"When it was the sellsword's turn, he came to the front of the class."
0,The walk he demonstrated was not the men's walk.
0,His feet stepped light in a straight line as his hips swayed.
0,"It was the girl's walk, but he perfectly mimicked the little girl’s limp."
0,"""That is the wrong walk,"" the instructor said, but the man continued now emphasizing the limp a little more."
0,"""Are you trying to make a mockery of this school?"""
0,she asked.
0,"""A mockery?"""
0,the sellsword asked.
0,"""Oh, you mean I should be walking like this."""
0,The sellsword executed the woman's walk perfectly but then overemphasized the sway of his hips.
0,With his hand on his hip he ran his other through his hair.
0,He turned to face the instructor holding is body in a curve.
0,This caused the girl with the lame foot to giggle.
0,"""I know plenty a harlot who walked like this,"" the sellsword explained."
0,"""Glad to know you are teaching these girls what they really need to know to survive."""
0,"""If you have no intention of taking this seriously, I ask that you leave,"" the instructor ordered."
0,The sellsword stretched his hands out to the side in an exaggerated bow.
0,"""Then I shall."""
0,He then knelt down in front of the girl with the lame foot and placed his hand on her head.
0,"""Don't be afraid to be yourself,"" he said."
0,"“There is nothing wrong with you.” Once the sellsword left, the instructor continued with her lecture."
0,The windows were darkened when the classes ended.
0,The parents of the children arrived to retrieve them and the other man bid me farewell as he left.
0,I thanked the instructor and walked outside.
1,"The sun had set, and the town was covered in a thick autumn haze preventing any real visibility beyond fifty feet."
0,"A few men stood outside the school, but none of them approached me."
0,I was unsure if any of them were Neil.
0,"""Neil?"""
0,I called out.
0,No one responded.
0,"I stood against the school waiting for Neil to show, but after an hour, it seemed he wouldn't."
0,"He never did say he would bring me back, only that he would bring me to the school."
0,"I decided that I would try to retrace my steps back to the healer's, but this thick darkness was unsettling."
0,"If it wasn't for the moon, which was only at half wane, and the occasional torch bearing townsfolk, there would have been no visibility."
0,I headed off in the direction we had come from and made a left.
0,"If I were to head this direction, I would get close to the center of town."
0,"Once at the court, I would been able to make it back after seeing the weather vane, assuming it was visible."
0,"When I got to a road that I thought would lead to the center of town, I turned right again."
0,"I kept walking, but the town center never appeared."
0,Perhaps I overshot it.
0,I walked back a few blocks then turned left to head back up.
0,The court never appeared.
0,I was starting to feel uneasy.
0,The streets were emptying by the minute removing the aid of the torches.
0,I looked around me at the identical buildings.
0,"For all I knew, I could be right in front of the school again."
0,"I ran further down the road, looking at every building and every person I passed."
0,I turned down different roads trying to find something I could recognize.
0,"The more it registered that it was all the same, the more I panicked."
0,I could not find the court.
0,I could not find the healer's home.
0,Once in an intersection I spun to look at all four directions.
0,There was no difference between them.
0,"I sat down on the ground, pulled my legs to my chest, and buried my head in my arms."
0,I remained like that until sunrise.
1,"When people began leaving their homes, I stood up again."
0,"My nerves had yet to settle, and the fog had not yet lifted, but it was lighter out."
0,"In the distance I could see the tower, but the direction of the weather vane was not visible."
0,I turned around and there it was.
0,Down the road was the silhouette of the town entrance.
0,It was not visible in the thick darkness of the previous evening.
0,From here I knew I could find the healer.
0,I walked to my right and counted three houses.
0,"When I opened the door, I did not see the home of the healer."
0,This was no shop; it was a normal house.
0,"Startled by my sudden appearance, a lady approached me."
0,"""Can I help you, young one?"""
0,"""I'm looking for the town healer…"" I mumbled."
0,"""You are on the wrong side of town."
0,"She lives near the western entrance."""
0,I could handle no more.
0,I sat down there in the entrance and leaned against the door.
0,"""Are you lost?"""
0,the lady asked.
0,"""Lost?"""
0,My hands balled into fists.
0,"""Every house I have entered has been different on the inside."
0,"Why is it so wrong to do the same on the outside so people like me can find their way around?"""
0,"""Get out,"" the lady said, taken aback by my outburst."
0,She grabbed a broom and proceeded to push me with it.
0,"""Out!"""
0,she screamed as I stumbled out the door.
0,"""The ignorance!"
0,"How dare you barge into my home and insult us like that."""
0,"Her door slammed, and I was left alone on the street yet again."
1,"After taking a moment to calm myself, I walked back to the road where the entrance was visible."
0,Did I really want to attempt to stay in this town over winter?
0,"I was sure I would grow accustomed to it in time, but the atmosphere was unsettling, and the mental toll it had on me was more than I wanted to deal with."
0,"""There you are!"""
0,called a familiar voice.
0,A man ran to me.
0,I had to make sure.
0,"""Neil?"""
0,"""The healer was worried when you never came back, so she sent me out looking for you."""
0,I remained silent.
0,"""Do you want to go back to the healer's and rest?"
0,"You look terribly tired."""
0,I shook my head.
0,"""I can't do it,"" I replied."
0,"""You cannot what?"""
0,Neil asked back.
0,"""This town, I can't get used to it."
0,"I can't be like everyone else."""
0,Neil stood silent in thought for a moment.
0,"""If you really wanted to stay here for the winter, the healer can help."
0,"Using her medicine, she could make you think more like we do."""
0,I recalled how healer's medicine made me tell her things I would not have otherwise said.
0,"If the same medicine could be used to change how I think, the thought of that alone terrified me."
0,"""No,"" I said."
0,"""I'm going to find somewhere else to stay."""
0,"""Are you sure?"""
0,I nodded.
0,"""Then I cannot stop you."
0,"It was a pleasure meeting you,"" Neil said, holding out his hand."
0,"I reached out mine, and he shook it."
0,"""Can I ask one question?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Of course."""
0,"""Why did you volunteer to help me?"""
0,"""It gave me a chance to do something different,"" Neil replied without a pause."
0,Neil saw me off as I walked out of town
1,"Once out of Ceanna, I found myself in the rubble of an old city."
0,Toppled stone structures and burnt homes lined both sides of the road.
0,"Nature had grown over most of it, showing that whatever had happened here was long past."
0,"There was no human life among the rubble, but the occasional animal was at play in the labyrinth of dilapidated structures."
0,"As I traveled through the old city, the sun burnt off the haze that had lingered overnight."
1,"In the distance the gate to another town came into view, but unlike Ceanna, it was garish."
0,There was no organization in its color or reason for its ornamentation.
0,"Spires stuck out at odd angles, and the gate itself was bent to the point of almost preventing functionality."
0,A man atop the gate called out to me as I approached.
0,"""What manner of visit is this?"""
0,he asked.
0,His accent was far different from the people of Ceanna.
0,"Though he pronounced all letters, he seemed to emphasize vowels at random, and his pitch fluctuated at the end of each word."
0,His apparel was also odd.
0,"His arms bore a colorful striped pattern of blue and light purple, and his headdress looked like he killed a pheasant and decided to wear it backwards on his head."
0,The tail sticking out over his forehead did have a nice effect.
0,"""Traveling,"" I replied."
0,"""Did those monsters put you in that?"""
0,the man asked.
0,"""We need to get you something else to wear."
0,"Come on in."""
0,"Instead of rising, the gate opened at a diagonal angle into the air, seeming to come unhinged from the left wall."
0,"""Welcome to Eagsula,"" the man said as I entered."
1,The view from the inside was breathtaking and in far contrast to Ceanna.
0,People were dressed in extravagant apparel full of color and a plethora of patterns.
0,"Some covered more of the body, some covered less."
0,"No two outfits were the same, but it was not just their outfits."
0,"Everyone talked differently, placing emphasis on or even removing sounds."
0,Everyone walked differently.
0,"Everyone was different, and it was fascinating."
0,The town itself was a great artistic display.
0,Every building had its own creative flair far different from the building next to it.
0,"One building could be spherical, while another perfect square."
0,Many buildings had no semblance of order with odd appendages jutting out in haphazard directions.
0,"Color seemed random, and structural stability was questionable in a few."
0,"The large town square past the gate was even paved with intricate, colorful stone designs, except for the very center which remained packed dirt with sparse patches of grass struggling to grow."
0,“What do you think?” the man asked from above me.
0,"""Nothing like you have ever seen before, right?"""
0,I shook my head.
0,"""I like it."""
0,"""Glad to hear,"" he said."
0,"""Now, you don't wanna go around town looking like that."
0,No one here thinks kindly of that place.
0,Follow the blue road until you see one paved with pebbles.
0,Down it you will find a building wrapped in fabric.
0,"You can purchase new clothes there."""
0,"""Thank you,"" I said."
0,"""No problem."
0,"Enjoy your stay."""
1,I walked through the town center and could not help but further admire what people wore.
0,The headdresses in particular stood out far above anything else.
0,Some mimicked plants and others animals.
0,"If there were feathers, they were of multiple sizes, colors, and numbers."
0,"Some looked like formal hats with reasonable variations, and others were so big and extravagant they had to weigh at least twenty pounds."
0,Those without a headdress had a unique hairstyle.
0,Many of the men were cut short with patterns shaved off.
0,"As I admired the diversity, I noticed the blue road the man at the gate had mentioned."
0,"The street was built of square stones with a blue hue, but every couple of stones was red."
0,"They were scattered haphazardly across the road, but that added to the artistic effect."
0,"The layout was so memorable that should I stumble upon the road again, I would know exactly where I was."
0,"The blue road wound in a leftward curve, and two streets down I saw a road paved with small round stones."
0,"I expected them to shift when I stood on them, but they were cemented to the ground."
0,"This left an odd feeling on my feet as I walked, but it felt good."
0,"Visible from where I stood next to the blue road, I saw the building wrapped in fabric."
0,I liked this town already.
0,"Compared to Ceanna, finding my way was as easy as remembering the unique design of each road and building."
1,I opened the door to the shop and saw the tailor working with a customer.
0,He was wrapping a light green sash around the waist of a man.
0,The man had dark blue slacks with studded leather chaps above the knees.
0,The sash was to hold what looked like a combination of a cape and robe close to his waist.
0,"The robe itself was a deep red, but the back was a mild yellow, the likes of which I would only expect to see on royalty."
0,Over the upper section of the robe was a tan leather vest with strange runes imprinted on it.
0,"The man also had a headdress, but not as gaudy as everyone else's."
0,"It was a band of dark red leather going around the head with thin strips running over the top, tied to the back of the  leather band, and draping down over the man's back."
0,"When the tailor was finished tying the sash, the man paid him in silver and turned for the door."
0,"""Look who it is,"" the man said."
0,"""Was Ceanna not for you either?"""
0,I recognized the voice.
0,It was the sellsword who had left the school.
0,"""I can understand why,"" he continued."
0,"""You may seem young, but something about you doesn't catch me as a sheep to be led around by others."
0,"Come here for a change of clothes?"""
0,I nodded.
0,"""You had better hope to have money and imagination."""
0,"""What for?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""You need to tell the tailor exactly what you want to wear and he will make it for you."
0,"If you haven't figured it out already, you had best think of something no one else would already be wearing."""
0,"""What about you?"""
0,I asked.
0,The sellsword looked down and picked at his robe.
0,"""Oh, the leather was already from my armor."
0,"I just needed to spice it up."""
0,"""And on your head?"""
0,"""That was mine from the start."
0,"Not only do I think it looks nice, but it keeps the sweat from running down my face when I'm fighting."""
0,The sellsword walked past me to the door.
0,"""Maybe I'll see you around town."""
0,"Before walking out, he tossed his silver purse to me."
0,"""You're giving me this?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""It was not mine to begin with,"" he replied before disappearing into the street."
1,"""So what'll it be,"" the tailor asked, speaking almost too fast for me to register what he said."
0,I thought about what I wanted to wear.
0,"If what the sells word said was true, I could have anything I asked for."
0,I looked at the foreign outfit I wore and thought back to the comfortable clothes Hazel and Alfred got for me.
0,That was my choice.
0,I described the clothing in the best detail I could to the tailor.
0,He took notes on a piece of parchment as I talked.
0,"Due to also missing the tattered cloth I had worn for so long, I also asked for a thin cloak to match it."
0,"""I do not have fabric of low enough quality to match what you requested,"" the tailor said once I was finished explaining."
0,"""That's fine."
0,"Do what you can."""
0,"""It does seem rather plain,"" he added, ""but because of that, it might work."
0,"Most people usually ask for something bright and extravagant."""
0,"""Then this way I will be different,"" I replied, now understanding what the sellsword was talking about."
0,"""Yes."
0,"Quite,"" the tailor said in excitement."
0,"""How much?"""
0,I asked.
0,The tailor scribbled some numbers on his parchment and walked me over to a scale.
0,"he added two small weights to one side, and I matched the weight on the other."
0,"""That is half,"" he explained."
0,"""The other half can be paid when you come to pick it up tomorrow."""
0,I thanked the tailor and returned to the street excited to see what else Eagsula had to offer.
1,"Not sure where I should go first, I walked back to the blue road and continued walking down it."
0,"The further I went, the wider it became."
0,"Soon, the stones changed to green, and food stalls lined both sides of the street."
0,Each stall was constructed different from the others.
0,"Many had colorful displays to draw customers, but the one that drew my eyes the most was one small stall that consisted of a blanket held up by four wooden poles."
0,It was run-down and simple.
0,"The owner, on the other hand was dressed up just as much as any other person I saw in town, not poor as I would have expected."
0,"He stood proud as he displayed his wares, potatoes that looked like he just dumped on the ground."
0,"""Why don't you have a showy stall like everyone else?"""
0,I asked him.
0,"""Cheeky,"" the potato seller replied."
0,"""A Ceanna boy asking why I'm not like everyone else."""
0,"""I'm not from Ceanna,"" I replied."
0,"""I just passed through."""
0,"""Oh, my apologies,"" he said."
0,"""You were dressed like them, so I only assumed."
0,"For your benefit, you should find something else to wear."""
0,"""I already went to the tailor,"" I replied."
0,"""Wonderful,"" the potato seller exclaimed."
0,"""Then to help you understand our city a little better, I will answer your question with another question."
0,"What was it that drew you to my stall?"""
0,he asked back.
0,It was then that I understood.
0,"""It stuck out,"" I replied."
0,"""By being plain, you are different."""
0,"""Precisely."
0,"Although even if I wasn't plain, people would still have to shop here."""
0,I moved out of the way as a few customers filled their bags with potatoes and paid the owner.
0,"""Even when you dump your produce on the ground?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""They came from the ground, did they not?"
0,The reason is that I am the only one who can sell potatoes.
0,"It's illegal for anyone else to do so."""
0,"""Why?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""If someone did, we would be the same,"" he replied."
0,"""Here."
0,"Because you are visiting, have one on me."""
0,The potato seller handed me a small potato and returned to helping customers.
0,"Not wanting a potato and being unable to eat it, I tried giving it way but to no avail."
0,Anyone I approached tried their best to avoid me.
0,"Giving up, I dropped the potato on the ground and continued looking around the town."
1,"Once I reached the end of the green road, I backtracked to the town square to find another road to walk down."
0,"Before I could decide, I heard some call out."
0,"""Boy!"""
0,"I looked around but with all the flare and extravagance moving around me, it was hard to find who was calling out to me."
0,"""Hey, boy!"
0,"What do you think you are doing?"""
0,A man ran towards me and grabbed my shoulder.
0,"""Are you trying to mock me?"""
0,His anger surprised me.
0,"""No,"" I answered."
0,"""Then why are you wearing that vest?"""
0,he asked.
0,I looked at the light blue vest I wore.
0,"Then I noticed the man wore the same vest, although he had no shirt underneath."
0,He grabbed my arm and pulled me over the side of the square.
0,People took notice and some followed us.
0,The man brought me to what I assumed was a town guard.
0,"He was armored, but no one piece of his armor matched another."
0,"""This boy is wearing my vest!"""
0,"the man yelled at the guard."""
0,"""It's not your vest,"" I said."
0,"""I got it from Ceanna."""
0,"""Not my vest?"""
0,The man's voice elevated an octave.
0,"""Here, that style of vest belongs to me, and only me!"""
0,The guard stood between the man and me.
0,He knelt down and inspected the fabric of my vest and then turned to look at the man's vest.
0,Once finished he cleared his throat.
0,"""The vests are the same,"" he said in a voice far too feminine for a man his size."
0,The guard’s announcement was met with gasps from the few onlookers.
0,"""Who had the vest first?"""
0,he asked.
0,"""I did!"""
0,the angry man proclaimed.
0,"""I have lived here for twenty-eight years."
0,"This boy is no older than twelve."""
0,"""I just arrived today,"" I admitted."
0,"""See."
0,"He confesses,"" the man said proudly."
0,"""I will take care of it,"" the guard said."
0,"""Go your way."""
0,"""I want this boy punished for thinking he could be me,"" the angry man said as he walked away."
1,"Once the crowd had dispersed, the knight pulled me off to the side down a gravel alley."
0,"I was nervous as to what was in store for me, but the guard only ruffled my hair."
0,"""Because you are a child and new to Eagsula, I'll let you off with only bad hair and the confiscation of your vest."""
0,"I breathed a sigh of relief at my lenient punishment, although the reason for which I found absurd."
0,"""Why was he so mad?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""People can get overzealous here."""
0,The guard explained.
0,"You had best find something unique to wear before people start singling you out for whatever reason they can find."""
0,"""I already went to the tailor."
0,"My clothes will be ready tomorrow."""
0,"""Wonderful,"" the guard said once again in his feminine voice."
0,"""Until then, stay out of crowded areas."
0,"If you want to explore the city, do it tomorrow."
0,"For now, go to the inn try not to attract attention."""
0,"""Where is the inn?"""
0,I asked.
0,Follow this road until you see a smooth black street on the left.
0,Take that one until it crosses the blue street.
0,Next to it will be a white road with steps.
0,Go up them and at the end you will find a wide cobblestone street.
0,"The inn is the only two-floor building on it, and it's much larger than all the others."""
0,I was once again thankful for easy to follow directions.
0,"After thanking the guard and handing him the blue vest, I followed his instructions and made my way to the cobblestone road."
0,"The path I took was much longer than needed, because I could see the square from where the white steps met the cobblestone road, but if what the guard said was correct, taking the long way was better than walking through a crowd until I picked up my clothes."
1,I located the largest building and went inside.
0,Multiple odd-shaped tables sat around a fire pit.
0,"The usual extravagant villagers were there, but I was also surprised to see a few normal looking folk, other travelers who happened to stumble upon this town."
0,Off in the corner I noticed a familiar runed vest and red leather headband.
0,The man took notice of me as I approached.
0,"""You following me?"""
0,"he asked, but his tone was playful."
0,"""You are the only person I know here,"" I replied."
0,"""Do you want the extra silver I won't be needing for my clothes?"""
0,"""What silver?"""
0,the sells sword asked back.
0,"""I don't remember giving you any."""
0,"""Never mind, then."""
0,"I replied, not wanting to press the issue."
0,"""Take a seat,"" he offered, pulling out one of the table's stools with his foot."
0,"""I'm not dangerous, to children at least."""
0,I accepted his offer and sat next to him.
0,"""Odd place, this is,"" he said as he leaned back against the wall and stared into the fire in the center of the room."
0,"""Some bastard started screaming at me because my boots looked like his."
0,He was right.
0,"They were almost exactly the same."""
0,He tapped his finger on the pommel of the sword at his hip.
0,"""So I drew my sword and challenged him for the right to wear these boots, and do you know what he did?"""
0,The sellsword lifted his legs up one by one and removed his boots.
0,"""He took his off and threw them at me,"" he said as he tossed his boots one by one across the room into the fire."
0,"""Turns out his were the same size as mine too."""
0,"The sellsword reached in the corner behind him and lifted up an identical pair of boots, although these were in better condition than the ones he had tossed into the fire."
0,He proceeded to place them on and lean back against the wall.
0,"""The same happened to me."
0,"But I lost mine,"" I admitted."
0,"""Is that what happened to your vest?"""
0,the sellsword asked.
0,"""No big loss."
0,It was ugly.
0,"You understand that the only reason he singled you out was because he knew he could win against a child, the coward."
0,"Have you ever thought of learning to fight?"""
0,I shook my head.
0,"""Your eyes tell me you have seen a lot of the world, and with that, how terrible a place it is."
0,"If you want to make your way in it, you have to fight for it."""
0,My duel with the knight came to mind.
0,"""I don't want to fight,"" I replied."
0,"""So you are going to let the world trample all over you and steal all your vests?"
0,"Well, if you ever get anymore vests like that, you probably deserve it, but the point still stands."
0,"Eventually you are going to find something to fight for and curse yourself because you lack the ability to do so."""
0,"""Is that why you became a sellsword?"""
0,I asked.
0,The man fell silent.
0,"""I'm sorry for asking,"" I replied."
0,"""I eloped with a nobleman's daughter, and we ran far away across the country together."
0,"We set up a small home by a river and lived well on our own, but eventually he found us."
0,He arrived with a large party of the most brutish men I had ever seen.
0,"He tore us from our home, took his daughter back, and put me in prison, leaving my daughter behind in the house."
0,I had to watch as my wife was remarried off to some other man who already had a woman of his own.
0,"Eventually I escaped when the villa was ransacked by the same brutes that bastard had hired to capture me, but when I returned to my home by the river, my daughter was gone."""
0,"""Is that why you are traveling?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""One of the reasons."""
0,The sellsword sat erect on his stool.
0,"""Barmaid, an ale!"""
0,he called out.
0,One of the women tending the guests brought a flask over and set it in front of us.
0,The sellsword set two silver pieces at the end of the table for her.
0,"""Want any?"""
0,he asked.
0,I shook my head.
0,"""More for me then."""
0,He grabbed the flask and drank it down.
1,I spent the remainder of the day in the sellsword's company until it was time for me to get a room to sleep.
0,I used the silver he had given me to pay for the smallest room they had.
0,All it had was a bed mat on the floor.
0,The silver was only to pay for the security.
0,I then realized something.
0,"The inside of the buildings in Ceanna were homely, personal."
0,"Both the interior of the tailor's shop and here at the inn were rather unimaginative, bland."
0,"Being thankful I at least had a mat to sleep on, I lay down on the thin bed mat and pulled the blanket over me."
1,"The next morning I set out and followed the white stepped road to the blue, and from the blue to the pebbled road."
0,I arrived early so that there would be fewer people out on the streets.
0,"The tailor was not yet open for business, so I sat beside the door and waited."
0,It was not until an hour later that I heard the slide of a latch from the other side of the door.
0,I stood up as the door opened.
0,The tailor startled.
0,"""You're up early,"" he said, but not as fast as he had been speaking the day before."
0,"""Is it finished?"""
0,"I asked, eager to change out of the despised Ceanna clothing, or at least this particular arrangement of clothing considering the individual articles were already worn by someone in town."
0,"""Finished last night,"" the tailor replied."
0,"""I can still make last minute changes."
0,"Are you sure you want something so simple?"""
0,I nodded.
0,"""Come in, come in."""
1,"I walked inside, and on the wall hung an almost exact replica of the clothes Hazel and Alfred gave me."
0,"The fabric was much higher quality, but that did not matter to me."
0,I removed the silver purse and set down my payment on the scale.
0,"The Tailor added weights to the other side, and the transaction was complete."
0,The tailor handed me my clothes and I proceeded to change.
0,"""Must you do that here?"""
0,"the Tailor asked, covering his eyes."
0,"""Have you no shame?"""
0,"Ignoring the tailor's protest, I finished changing."
0,The clothes were not only lighter but warmer and far more comfortable.
0,"It was a nostalgic feeling, similar to when I traveled with only the ragged cloth as my covering."
0,I handed the Ceanna clothes to the tailor.
0,"""Keep them,"" I said."
1,"Now with my new clothing, I felt safe to walk around and see the city."
0,I wrapped the cloak around me and left the shop.
0,"Back at the square, I searched for a road with a pattern I had yet to travel."
0,An orange striped road ran off to the left.
0,"That was my next destination; however, before I could reach it, someone grabbed onto my shoulder."
0,"""What do you think you are doing?"""
0,a woman asked as she spun me to face her.
0,"""That is my cloak you are wearing."""
0,"Sure enough, the woman was wearing a cloak identical to the one the tailor had made for me."
0,"She tried to drag me off to a guard like the other man had, but I shook off her hand."
0,"""I just got this,"" I protested."
0,"""That's not my problem,"" the angry woman said."
0,"""I just arrived yesterday."
0,How am I supposed to know what someone else is wearing?
0,"This is asinine."""
0,"""It's up to you to find out how to fit in."
0,"If you can't find your own niche, you will never be accepted."
0,"That's how it works here."""
0,"""Then I don't want to be accepted,"" I replied, rather annoyed."
0,"""Guard!"""
0,the woman cried.
0,A guard came over and asked what the matter was.
0,"He was a different guard than the one I had met the day before, but his armor was the same, or at least similar."
0,It appeared to be made up of other pieces of the same armor sets that the former guard had been wearing.
0,"""This boy is wearing my cloak,"" the woman protested."
0,"""It is not yours,"" I challenged."
0,"""I bought it this morning from the tailor."
0,"It's mine."""
0,"""You may have bought it from the tailor, but you have to get the right to wear it from me."""
0,"Again, a crowd began to gather around us."
0,"""Boy,"" the guard said, ""I have seen this lady with the cloak long before I ever saw you."""
0,His tone was low and demeaning.
0,"Not wanting to cause a bigger scene, I removed my cloak but held onto it."
0,"""Confiscate that,"" the woman ordered the guard."
0,"""You said the right to wear it was yours, but the fact still stands that I bought it,"" I replied."
0,"""Preposterous!"""
0,"""Hey!"""
0,another from the crowd called out.
0,"""That's my shirt too!"""
0,The man walked out from the crowd and stood next to the woman.
0,The crowd was now growing at a rapid rate.
0,"The more people that filed in, the larger the circle around the four of us became."
0,I was beyond frustrated with the absurd claims of these people.
0,"""I'm not going to wait another day for the only tailor in town to fashion some gaudy outfit to meet your baseless demands,"" I protested back."
0,"""Give me that shirt,"" the man demanded."
0,"""Fine."""
0,"I removed the shirt, but did not stop there."
0,"If these people were going to grow angry no matter what I wore, then I wasn't going to wear anything at all."
0,"I dropped my cloak, pants, and shirt at my feet."
0,"""Happy?"""
0,I asked.
0,The crowd grew silent.
0,"Whether in shock or confusion, I did not know."
0,"""You think you could shirk our laws by stripping?"""
0,called a woman from the crowd.
0,She weaved her way through and stood with us in the center.
0,She wore no clothing at all.
0,"""I alone have the right to be naked in public,"" she proclaimed, ""and I had to work hard for it."
0,"Only the most beautiful gets that right."""
0,"""Aren't you cold?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""That doesn't matter."
0,"I have my pride to uphold,"" she replied."
0,"""One has truly lost sense who sacrifices dignity for pride,"" called a familiar voice from behind me."
0,The sellsword walked in front of me to confront the accusers.
0,"He drew his sword but did not hold it aggressively, only holding at his side."
0,"""You would draw your weapon on those who are only upholding the law?"""
0,the guard asked.
0,"""What just law makes a child strip in the cold in order to fit in?"""
0,the sellsword asked.
0,"""You question our laws?"""
0,"""Your laws state that the boy must be different."
0,"He is."""
0,The sellsword turned to the naked woman and lowered his eyes.
0,"""He obviously has something that you, pretty little lady, certainly lack."
0,"You know, I only spent one day in Ceanna, and I hated it, but after two here, I'm starting to think Ceanna was not such a bad place after all."
0,"If you hate them so much, you should at least try to be better."""
0,"""At least they were helpful,"" I added."
0,The crowd began to whisper among themselves and grew more displeased by the second.
0,"""Anarchist!"""
0,someone yelled.
0,"""Rebel!"""
0,shouted another.
0,"""I thought the whole purpose of this town was rebellion,"" the sellsword jeered."
0,"""You are under arrest for speaking against our laws and attempting to insight anarchy,"" the guard stated."
0,"""You have got to be kidding me,"" the sellsword mumbled."
0,"""Looks like I only made it worse,"" he said to me."
0,He drew his sword and knocked out the guard as he tried to apprehend him.
0,"More guards showed up, and even the villagers came for us."
0,"Overwhelmed, both the sellsword and I were forced to the packed dirt and bound."
0,"To prevent the sellsword from struggling, they struck him in the head until he passed out."
1,They dragged us into a door by the gate where we were imprisoned.
0,There were no windows in the small room.
0,The only light came from the cracks in the door.
0,I sat there in dark silence for hours until the limp body beside me stirred.
0,"""Ugh, what did they hit me with?"""
0,the sellsword mumbled.
0,"""Your sword's pommel,"" I answered."
0,"""Well, that's humiliating,"" he laughed."
0,"""Sorry for making it worse."""
0,"""I've been in this position plenty of times before."
0,"I've learned to accept it,"" I replied."
0,"""You are a pitiful little thing."
0,"Haven't you ever thought of sticking up for yourself?"""
0,"""Whenever I do, I only hurt people."""
0,"""That is kind of the point."
0,"You do understand that, right?"""
0,"""You don't understand."
0,"When I hurt anyone, I also get hurt."
0,"If I break an arm, my arm breaks."
0,"If I cut someone, I also get cut."""
0,"""What kind of witchcraft is that?"""
0,the sellsword asked in disbelief.
0,"""You had better be careful when you find yourself a girl."
0,"That first night will be shock, I assure you."""
0,The sellsword worked himself into sitting position.
0,"Outside, sounds of construction could be heard."
0,"""Looks like they might be preparing a little surprise for us."
0,"A beating, no doubt."""
0,"""Why do they get so angry when you wear something they have?"""
0,"""I suppose the same reason the people of Ceanna hates anomalies."
0,"I did a little digging my first day in Eagsula to find out the reason for these polar opposite towns."""
0,"""What did you find?"""
0,"""That they are actually one town, or were."
0,You had to have seen the ruins between the towns.
0,"Turns out there was a tyrannical, as the Eagsula townsfolk explain it, king who laid strict laws of dress and manner to keep his people in line."
0,"Eventually people wanted to think for themselves, be different, so they rose up against the law."
0,"The rebel faction grew, and the king was eventually assassinated."
0,"With no ruler, the population was split on how to govern."
0,"Those in support of the former king wanted the laws to stay the same, but the rebels wanted change."
0,The conflict rose into a civil war that divided the metropolis.
0,Eventually both sides exhausted themselves and decided to go their own ways and build towns on opposite sides of the city.
0,"Ceanna, as you can guess, supported the kings ideals of unification, but I think they took it to the extreme to prevent another uprising."""
0,"""Then Eagsula was the rebels who didn't want anything to do with order."""
0,"""It makes you wonder why then do they want to punish us for anarchy."
0,"They try to look extravagant and different, but deep down they are living no different than those in Ceanna."
0,They wake up each morning at relatively the same time.
0,"They eat, shop, work, drink, and go to bed to do it all again the next day."
0,They are all human.
0,"They all get angry for the most pointless of reasons."""
0,The sellsword paused for a moment.
0,"""I'm curious what Ceanna would have done if we said Eagsula was better."""
1,The door opened.
0,"Without a word, we were dragged to the center of the square."
0,"Upon the packed dirt were what looked like an apparatus for hanging someone with faggots piled beneath, and an executioner's block."
0,We were not in for a simple beating.
0,"""Damn."""
0,"The sellsword began to struggle, but more guard's flocked in to carry him to the block."
0,I was pulled to be hung.
0,"""As per our law,"" announced the judiciary, ""Those accused of inciting anarchy shall be put to death in a manner never before attempted."""
0,The guards hung me by my ankles over the faggots.
0,The sellsword's head was not placed over the block.
0,"Instead, his back was arched over it with his hands and ankles tied to stakes in the ground."
0,"""Any final words?"""
0,the judiciary asked the sellsword and the executioner readied his axe.
0,The sellsword laughed.
0,"""Want to know the irony of a mob?"
0,"You all act the same."""
0,"The large axe fell, cutting the man."
0,The first strike did not sever him.
0,The sellsword was left screaming until the next two strikes finished the job.
0,"All the while the crowd laughed, and all the while I could not help but feel it was my fault, but I was too late to do anything."
0,I could have stopped it.
0,I had the strength to.
0,"Was I afraid of hurting someone, even if that meant they would not be hurting another?"
0,I did feel the punishment unjust.
0,"I knew it was wrong, but I just hung there silent."
0,"I stretched my ankles until I heard the sinews of the ropes start to pop just to show myself that I could have gotten free, and it only deepened my regret."
0,"""Any last words?"""
0,the judiciary asked me.
0,"""The clothes you took, wherever you put my body, can you put them with me?"
0,"I'm sure they are of no use to those who have the right to wear them."""
0,"""An odd request, but we will grant it."""
0,The executioner lit the faggots.
0,"As the fire grew, so did the searing pain."
0,"This was not the first time I had experienced being burned alive, and I was not going to give these monsters the joy of hearing me cry out."
0,"I bit my lip until the suffocation, heat, and pain rid me of consciousness."
1,"I did not know how long had passed, how many days or weeks."
0,I stirred as pain from my body shot out like millions of sharp thorns.
0,I was alive once more.
0,My body had healed as it always does.
0,My eyes fought to find focus as I sat up.
0,A small courtyard encompassed me.
0,In front stood the ruin of a small fortress or castle.
0,They dumped their dead in the home of their former king.
0,A hand reached out to me.
0,"Grabbing it, the hand pulled me to my feet."
0,"In front of me stood the sellsword, his freckled face clear and smiling."
0,I could see his face.
0,"""Immortal too,"" he said."
0,"""You are quite the anomaly."
0,"You would have done well in Eagsula."""
0,"""No,"" I replied."
0,"""I'm nothing like them."""
0,"""Quite,"" he laughed."
0,"The apparition disappeared, and I was left on my own."
0,I searched the courtyard and found the small set of clothing I had requested.
0,At least they respected the final wish of the deceased.
0,"Once dressed, I stumbled out of the courtyard while my feet learned once again how to walk."
