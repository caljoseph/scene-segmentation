1,My body ached as I walked.
0,I was an idiot.
0,"Winter had passed, but my body had yet to fully recover from being burned alive."
0,"In addition, the fire brought back to memory the death of Alfred and Hazel, plaguing me yet again with nightmares, but now there was another addition, the sellsword who died because he stood up for me."
0,"At least with winter passed, I would have the warmer weather to look forward to."
0,My body always seemed to heal faster in warmth.
0,My thoughts were cut short by something ahead of me beside the road.
0,A leg stuck out from a bush.
0,It was clad in a dull orange armor.
0,"As I neared, a smell not unlike the meat storage in Alfred's cellar assaulted my nose only more pungent with rot."
0,"Keeping to the far side of the muddy road, I rounded to the other side of the bush."
0,There laid a knight in bronze with a broke steel sword protruding from the mail in his midriff.
0,"Wild animals had gotten at his face, and I was relieved the remainder of his body was concealed by the armor."
0,"Not wanting to stay near death, I ran further down the path away from the decaying body only to find another, this time further decayed than the last by at least an hundred years."
0,"This new body had been looted, only skeleton and shredded fabric remaining, a fate I did not doubt the former knight would soon meet when the traveling season returned."
0,"With the two bodies behind me, I began to worry about the safety of the road."
0,"This country was foreign to me, as was its dangers."
0,"The further I traveled down the muddy path the more bodies appeared, some on the road, some off."
0,One was even hanging in a far-off tree.
0,"Each appeared to be, or at least had been, a warrior of some class or another."
0,I retrieved a rusted dagger from one of the bodies for what protection it could offer me.
0,"I knew I would survive, whatever may come, but I hated pain and wanted to avoid it if at all possible."
1,"Through the patter of the light rain, I heard a thundering down the path behind me."
0,"Not wanting to find out who or what it was, I hid myself in bushes not far off the road."
0,Within seconds a horse raced by being driven by a silver-clad knight.
0,"Further down the road, almost out of view, another man in armor noticed the speeding horse and turned to face it."
0,"Without adequate reaction, the man's head fell by the roadside with a swift cross of the rider’s blade."
0,The horse did not slow its pace as the rider continued onward.
0,This was not a welcome road.
1,I kept to the tree line but still followed the road.
0,"The further I traveled, the more the bodies piled up."
0,It was not uncommon to see four to five bodies along the roadside at any given time with a level of decay ranging from fresh kill to skeletal remains.
0,"The greater the number of bodies, the closer to the trees I walked, but it had been some time since the rider passed, and I had not seen another person for hours."
0,"With a rustle of grass, cold metal was against my neck."
0,"""Who are you?"""
0,A stern voice sounded from behind.
0,"""No one,"" I replied without moving from my position."
0,"""Why do you follow the road?"""
0,"Hearing the voice a second time, it sounded like a boy my age, but the angle of the sword suggested otherwise."
0,My interrogator was too tall.
0,"""Do not make me ask again,"" the voice threatened."
0,"Before I could answer, the gallop of a horse echoed down the road yet again."
0,My attacker grabbed me from my collar and threw me into the trees.
0,The thin figure situated itself on top me with the slender sword at my throat.
0,What I had assumed to be a young boy was a woman clad in light steel armor.
0,"""Wha--"""
0,"""Quiet."""
0,"She ordered, now with her hand on my mouth."
0,"Back on the road, the same horse-mounted silver knight was heading back the other direction with sword drawn."
0,We kept silent until the horse could no longer be heard.
0,My attacker's armor was a design I had never seen before.
0,"It kept close to her body, accentuating her figure."
0,The mail underneath was covered with a thin white fabric and only showed in the joints and under-armor.
0,"I could not imagine this armor providing much protection, but with how thin the sword was, I assumed the goal was not to be hit."
0,The armor was built for mobility.
0,"Her sword arm was bare of armor below the elbow, but her left arm which she held over my mouth had a thick bracer which extended to the knuckles."
0,She wore no helmet and let her tan hair like wilting grain hang down about her shoulders.
0,"Once certain the rider was gone, the warrior turned her attention back to me."
0,"""Do I need to ask again?"""
0,I shook my head.
0,The warrior removed her hand but kept her sword at my throat.
0,"""Strange to see one so young with no fear in his eyes in the face of death."""
0,"""I'm no stranger to it,"" I replied."
0,"""I'm only traveling the road."
0,"I know nothing about this place."""
0,"""Hmm?"""
0,"The warrior removed herself from off me, but kept knelt down at sword's length."
0,"""I guess only an ignorant boy would travel though here."
0,"Where are you headed?"""
0,"""I don't have a destination."""
0,"""An orphan?"""
0,"she asked, relaxing some but keeping her sword pointed at me."
0,"""I have no parents, so I guess you could say that,"" I replied as I sat up."
0,"""Who was that knight on horseback?"""
0,"""My guess is that his goal is the same as mine, only he's searching for fights."
0,"I prefer to avoid them."""
0,"""What goal?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""You really are not from around here, are you?"""
0,The warrior got to her feet and slipped her sword through a sash around her waist.
0,"Offering her hand, she helped me to my feet."
0,"""Since the road's no good, I'll have to go cross country."""
0,"""Where are you headed?"""
0,I asked.
0,"Without answering either of my questions, she began walking deeper into the woods."
0,"Against my better judgment, I decided to follow."
0,"More accurately, something about her drew me in."
0,"""Following me is dangerous,"" she warned."
0,"""You should head back?"""
0,"""To the road?"
0,I already saw what that knight does to people he finds traveling it.
0,"My bet is that I would be safer with you."""
0,"""How do you mean?"""
0,The warrior stopped walking and looked over her shoulder.
0,"""You don't want to kill me, or you would have already."""
0,"""I guess not,"" the warrior shrugged, ""but I'm not the type to care if an orphan dies in the wilds."""
0,"""I'm fine with that,"" I replied."
0,"""I don't expect you to look out for me."""
0,"""Then I see no reason you can't follow."""
0,The warrior continued walking but stopped by a bush.
0,"""But make yourself useful."""
0,She removed a sack and tossed it to me.
0,"""Carry my provisions."
0,"You can be my squire of sorts."""
0,"""Squire?"""
0,I picked up the sack that landed a short distance in front of me.
0,"""But I'm not nobility, and don't want to become a knight."""
0,"""Squire has another meaning,"" the warrior replied."
0,"""It does?"""
0,"""A lady's escort."""
0,"With a smirk, she continued walking."
0,I swung the sack over my shoulder and followed close behind.
1,"""You have followed me all this time but have yet to ask who I am,"" the warrior said, breaking the silence of half a day's traveling."
0,"""I make a habit not ask,"" I replied, now walking beside her."
0,"""Why is that?"""
0,"""If I do, someone is bound to ask about me."""
0,"""Is that bad?"""
0,"""I would have nothing to answer."""
0,The warrior stopped to face me.
0,"""Evelyn, daughter of Jeremiah, blacksmith of Egenmor."""
0,"""A smith's daughter?"
0,"Is that why you have a boy’s name?"""
0,"""I am a smith by trade as well, and the origin of my name in of no concern."
0,"What about you?"""
0,I remained silent.
0,"""Your name at least?"""
0,Evelyn pried.
0,"""I don't have one."""
0,"""You must have been orphaned rather young."
0,"Can you at least tell me what country you are from?"""
0,I shook my head.
0,"""I've been wandering as long as I can remember, for years."""
0,"""I see, but what for?"""
0,Evelyn continued walking.
0,"""You could have found some town to settle in."""
0,The burning cottage on the hill crept into my mind.
0,"""No,"" I shook my head."
0,"""If I stay somewhere for too long, something bad always happens."""
0,“So you are a bad omen of sorts?
0,I hold little faith in such superstitions.”
0,Evelyn did not question me further.
1,"The sun had set, and the remaining light in the sky was waning fast."
0,The heavy cloud cover meant a dark night awaited us.
0,Evelyn searched out a dense grove of trees with high bushes and shrubbery.
0,"After making certain there were no dead bodies in the general vicinity, she pulled me inside an outcropping of bushes."
0,"""We stay here tonight,"" Evelyn ordered."
0,"""Traveling in the dark only increases the danger."""
0,"""Wouldn't traveling at night make us harder to see?"""
0,I inquired.
0,"""And what if everyone else believed that?"""
0,Evelyn replied.
0,I didn't have an answer.
0,"""After we left the road, we never ran into anyone, correct?"""
0,I nodded.
0,"""But there were still bodies, a few of them fresh."""
0,I nodded again.
0,"""They all travel at night because they think it's safe."
0,Few travel during the day for fear of being spotted by another warrior or knight or brute of some sort.
0,"What amuses me is that even though more deaths occur at night, no one wants to travel during the day for fear of it being worse; whereas if they would muster the courage to do so, they would find it far safer."""
0,Evelyn removed her sword and set it beside her as she leaned against a tree.
0,I was not too sure of her choice in location.
0,"We were hidden well in the brush, but at the same time, there was no way to see if anyone was approaching, especially in the dark."
0,“I’m guessing no fire.”
0,“You would guess correctly.
0,Give me my bag.”
0,"I handed the sack over, and Evelyn removed a wrapped roll of bread."
0,"Breaking off a third of it, she handed the piece to me."
0,"“Thank you, but I don’t need it,” I said, pushing Evelyn’s hand back to her."
0,“No?
0,Your choice.” Evelyn took a bite.
0,“When will they come out?”
0,“We still have about an hour.
0,It’s still light enough to see a good distance.”
0,"“Then, can I ask you something?” I sat against the trunk of the tree beside her."
0,Evelyn remained silent.
0,I figured that she was waiting to hear what the question was.
0,I was nervous to ask again because she had ignored the question before.
0,"“What are you, and I assume the other warriors, after?”"
0,"After a long exhale, Evelyn folded her arms."
0,"“Women, well, girls in general, are not highly thought of."
0,You may be too young still to notice.
0,"Families want boys to work the fields, fight the wars, and take over the family trade."
0,"If you have a daughter, you don’t have much choice but to marry her off in the most beneficial way possible.”"
0,"“I’m not following,” I said with honesty."
0,"“I was one of those girls, or was going to be."
0,I told you my father was a smith.
0,"Well, our family was coming under hard times due to slander against his business."
0,"It would not have been long until we lost our home, left to wander as beggars on the streets."
0,A wealthy landowner came to my father to ask for me.
0,"In return, he would fund my father setting up business in another hold at the cost of a percentage of his sales."
0,"I was about your age at the time, and the man, old enough to have marriageable children of his own."
0,"“Without even asking whether I was to be that man’s servant, wife, or mistress, my father consented."
0,He had his two sons to carry on the trade.
0,"I was only extra to him, an increase in expense."
0,"With the deal signed and property bought, I was handed off to the land owner."
0,"Once inside the cart, it was clear what he was after."
0,He wasted no time in assaulting me.”
0,Evelyn’s explanation was far more personal than I was expecting.
0,"I was still lost on how this connected her to this battle that seemed to be happening around us, but I kept silent and listened."
0,“I doubt he expected a young girl like me to have so much fight in her.
0,I managed to get the cart door open with most my clothing still on.
0,He called the driver to stop when I jumped out and tumbled on the road.
0,"At his command, his two drivers chased me down and brought me back."
0,It was then I challenged him.
0,"I would fight him, and should I win, he had to let me go.” "
0,Evelyn’s voice became excited.
0,“They had a good laugh.
0,"One of the drivers handed me a short sword, or a dagger."
0,I can’t remember now.
0,"I was small, so it was bigger in my memory."
0,I stood before him with the small weapon in both hands in front of me.
0,"Until then, I had only seen my brothers duel."
0,I had no experience of my own.
0,I’ll never forget the look on that man’s face as I charged him.
0,"He had his own sword, full sized of course, but he wanted me, so I knew he wouldn’t kill me."
0,"I ran at his blade, and he pulled it back to prevent me harm."
0,That was his last mistake.
0,My dagger slid straight in.
0,"In shock, he swung his sword at me to knock me back."
0,That’s how I got this scar.”
0,"Evelyn pointed at her upper cheek, but like the rest of her face, I couldn’t see the scar."
0,“I ran away as the men tended to their master.
0,I never found out if he died or not.
0,"I ended up heading to the southern country, to the coast."
0,"I was poor, homeless, much like you are now."
0,No one wanted to hire a girl.
0,"When looking for work, the only answers I received were selling myself or letting some man take me in."
0,It sickened me.
0,I wanted to prove I was as good as any other man.
0,In time I met an elderly blacksmith with no successor.
0,"He was seeking for an apprentice, so I decided to ask."
0,"I was laughed at, of course, but he soon realized I knew the methods better than any other boy who stumbled in."
0,I only lacked the practice.
0,“A couple years of ridicule followed as the word got around that a young girl had been employed by one of the town’s smiths.
0,"I only wanted to prove my place, but in the end I only caused more trouble."
0,"Those who gave us business complimented the quality, my quality, yet in the end business crumbled, and the kind man who took me in died the next year poor and famished."
0,I made it my goal to change how our era viewed women.
0,I didn’t know how until a year ago.
0,"“I had set up my own blacksmith in a small town, and as usual received little business."
0,"Most of what I made, I made for myself."
0,The rest were minor repairs on farm tools.
0,"During my apprenticeship, I had often heard people talk of a legendary sword in the north, and it was not until I had set up my shop in the north that I learned of it’s believed location from a warrior headed there himself."
0,"That summer, I closed shop and made preparations.”"
0,"“So you believe that if you were to find this sword, you would prove that women are just as capable as men?” I asked."
0,"“Well, that’s the plan, but I guess it’s more for me than anyone else."
0,I wanted to prove I could do it.”
0,“And all the others out here are also after the sword?”
0,“I believe so.
0,It usually happens in waves.
0,"Once word travels that someone is after it, everyone else decides they want it as well."
0,"The farther the word spreads, the greater the bloodbath becomes."
0,"To be honest, this is my second time searching for the sword."
0,It’s been eight years since my father sold me.
0,"I wanted to try before it came to the point where I would have to settle down somewhere, if anyone would take me.”"
0,"“If everyone is after it, how do you know someone hasn’t already found it?”"
0,"“If someone had, I’m sure word would have spread fast."
0,"At least, that is what I am hoping on.”"
0,I felt sorry for Evelyn but also admired her drive.
0,She had taken a substantial loss and was now using it for a purpose beyond herself.
0,"""I'll take first watch,"" Evelyn said, cutting off my thoughts."
0,"""You get some rest."
0,"I'll wake you when I need you to take over."""
0,"""If you want, I can keep watch all night,"" I suggested."
0,"""You are the one who will be doing all the fighting should someone find us."""
0,"""You do not plan on protecting yourself?"""
0,"""I guess I can if I have to, but I have no skill in it."""
0,"""I am grateful for the offer, but you will need rest just as much as I,"" Evelyn asserted."
0,"Not wanting to argue, I closed my eyes and slouched against the trunk of the tree."
0,"""I have to admit, this is better than leaving my life up to fate at night,"" Evelyn said before I nodded off to sleep."
1,"At an unknown time during the night, Evelyn woke me to change watch."
0,The only instruction I was given was to keep an ear open.
0,Within an hour I understood what she had told me.
0,There was something walking through the woods every few minutes.
0,"At times, the clash of metal sounded in the distance."
0,The nearest anyone had gotten to us was about fifty yards.
0,"Despite this, Evelyn slept sound."
1,"Once the sun had risen, I contemplated waking her, but decided that a little extra rest would help her in the long run."
0,The darkness of night had changed to morning fog by the time the woman next to me stirred.
0,Evelyn's head shot side to side and then up at the tree.
0,"""How long has the sun been up?"""
0,"""About three hours?"""
0,I replied.
0,"""Why did you not wake me?"""
0,she asked quiet yet stern.
0,"""That is three hours' time lost."""
0,"""If no one has ever retrieved the sword, I doubt three hours will change that,"" I replied."
0,"""I guess I can't argue,"" Evelyn said as she stretched her arms."
0,"""I haven't slept that well since I left."""
0,"Evelyn reached inside her bag and retrieved another roll, this time breaking it in half."
0,"""Keep it,"" I said."
0,"""And here I was thinking I would be generous to you for keeping watch,"" Evelyn said with a sneer."
0,"""Thank you, but I don't need it,"" I replied, trying to sound sincere."
0,"""Your choice."""
0,"With a shrug, Evelyn made quick work of the roll."
0,"With the bag around my back, Evelyn checked our surroundings before deciding it was safe to leave."
0,"Within the first few minutes, the results of last night were already visible."
0,One fresh body lay mangled under a tree with its blood still shimmering in the light breaking through the leaves.
0,Another body a short distance further had two arrows in it.
0,Evelyn kept her hand on the sword set in the sash at her waist as we continued.
0,I had counted no less than two dozen sets of footsteps in the few hours I had been keeping watch and yet all morning we had not seen a single living person.
1,The sun was at high noon when we reached a stream dug into a shallow valley.
0,Evelyn made the call to rest.
0,"At her order, I ran upstream but remained in view to check to see if a body had been dumped in the water."
0,"As far as I could see, the stream was clear."
0,"With this news, Evelyn filled the flask at her hip with the stream water."
0,"""Can you climb?"""
0,she asked as she began doffing her chest armor.
0,"""I can,"" I replied, confused at her question."
0,"""Hand me my bag and climb a tree."
0,"I need you to keep watch for a moment."""
0,"After handing over the bag, I walked over to the nearest climbable tree and sat on a branch low enough for the new spring leaves to obstruct my vision as little as possible."
0,Below me Evelyn removed her blouse and lowered herself into the stream.
0,On her left shoulder blade was a swollen red gash.
0,It was not deep but still threatened infection.
0,Using a cloth dampened in the stream she cleaned it and applies some liquid in a small flask from inside the bag.
0,"It had to have stung, because Evelyn winced in pain once it touched the sore."
0,"Turning around to check on me, she noticed my stare and pointed off in the distance."
0,"I averted my gaze to keep watch as instructed, but I couldn't help but notice a long scar over her left breast that led to her face."
0,"Should that scar continue its course, it would have crossed her upper cheek."
0,"""There's blood in the water,"" Evelyn said jumping out of the stream."
0,"""Can you see anything?"""
0,I cast my eyes upstream.
0,A warrior spotted me and charged our direction.
0,"I dropped from the tree and ran to Evelyn to help her don her armor, but we were not fast enough."
0,Evelyn pushed me into the stream as the warrior swung down between us.
0,Evelyn scrambled backwards to dodge the next swing.
0,The warrior was clad in dark iron and brandished a claymore tight in his hands.
0,"Evelyn was not only unarmed, but her chest plate sat beside the stream next to her sword."
0,"With nothing protecting her upper body, I feared for Evelyn's life."
0,"Knowing that there was no time for her armor, our only chance was for me to give Evelyn her sword."
0,I waded to the edge of the stream and grabbed the thin blade.
0,"The sword was light, almost weightless."
0,Evelyn fell to her back to avoid a broad swing from the knight.
0,"Rolling to the side, and with a swift kick, she hit the side of his knee."
0,"His heavy armor absorbed most of the blow, but it was enough to send him off balance into a stagger allowing Evelyn to distance herself."
0,I ran Evelyn's sword to her as the knight regained his footing.
0,"When I handed it off, the knight threw a dagger at us."
0,"With Evelyn not in a position to block it, I batted it way with my left arm."
0,"The knife dug in, but I was able to prevent us any major injury."
0,"With Evelyn now armed, she stood confident in a stance I had not seen before."
0,She stood sideways pointing her blade underhanded at chest height.
0,"Her feet moved in quick, controlled steps as she dodged his attacks."
0,Never once did she use her own sword to deflect his.
0,"Due to weight of the knight's armor, he was far outclassed in speed."
0,Evelyn kept past the claymore's striking distance looking for an opening.
0,"After another broad swing, she found it."
0,"With a lunge distance I thought was beyond human ability, she shot the tip of her sword between the knights pauldron and chest plate."
0,The blade was unhindered by the mail beneath and dug deep into the knight's shoulder.
0,"His swings now lacked the ferocity they once had, but that did not remove the danger."
0,Evelyn returned to her dance around the knight until an opening appeared yet again.
0,"Aiming at the same shoulder, her blade dug deep."
0,The knight's arm was now weakened.
0,"He struggled to keep the heavy claymore supported with one hand and gave up, deciding to drop the sword and charge Evelyn with raised fists."
0,Evelyn took aim and shot her blade out at the knight's visor.
0,"With a twist of his head, the tip grazed off the helmet."
0,Evelyn was now close enough for him to land a solid hit to her midsection.
0,"Evelyn jumped backwards to weaken the impact, but it still left her short of breath."
0,"Not giving her a chance to recover, the night swung again."
0,Evelyn dodged to the side and rounded back behind the knight.
0,"With two quick jabs in the mail behind the knight's knees, she dropped him to the ground."
0,The knight knew he had been defeated.
0,"He knelt on the ground, supporting himself with his one good arm."
0,Evelyn unlatched and removed his helmet.
0,The graying man looked at Evelyn and spoke with malice.
0,"""Finish it, wench"" he ordered."
0,Evelyn returned her sword to its sash and called to me.
0,"""Give me my armor."""
0,"I ran Evelyn's blouse, chest plate, and bracer to her and assisted in tying and latching them."
0,"""This is why a woman will never become legend!"""
0,the defeated knight yelled.
0,"Without hesitation, Evelyn drew her sword and thrust it through the eye of the knight."
0,"""We need to leave,"" she said, returning the sword to her side yet again."
0,"""Someone was bound to hear that."""
1,I grabbed the sack and followed Evelyn upstream.
0,"It was not long before we encountered the dead body that had been tossed in, one of the former knight's kills."
0,There did not seem to be any sign of a struggle.
0,"""That's why we never heard the battle,"" Evelyn stated."
0,I looked at her in confusion.
0,"""Another reason not to sleep during the day."""
1,I followed her to the crest of the shallow valley and across a large field.
0,The burnt remains of a farmhouse sat near the far side.
0,Evelyn removed her sword before approaching.
0,"Seeing it clear, she pulled me inside."
0,Evelyn whipped the side of my shoulder with the flat side of her sword.
0,“I thought I told you to keep watch.
0,"What were you thinking, gawking at me like that?” "
0,Without waiting for an answer she sat down against one of the charred walls.
0,“But I guess it’s understandable.
0,You are old enough to get aroused.
0,Show me your arm.”
0,I walked over and pulled up my bloody sleeve.
0,"“It’ll be fine,” I assured her."
0,"Not listening, Evelyn tore off a section of her blouse hanging below her chest plate."
0,“My bag?” 
0,"I handed it to her, and she removed the small flask she had used to treat the wound on her back."
0,"After dampening the cloth with the liquid, she began wiping my arm."
0,"I cringed from the burn of the liquid as Evelyn wiped the wound, but I got used to the pain fast."
0,“Do you find me attractive?”
0,Evelyn’s question took me by surprise.
0,“How do you mean?”
0,"“You saw me, right?"
0,Do you think another man would be genuinely interested in me?”
0,"“I thought you were not interested in men?” I replied, remembering why she was going after the sword."
0,“Do not get me wrong.
0,"I’m not pleased with how women are treated, but that does not mean I have no aspiration of starting a family of my own."
0,It will not be long before I will be looked over in favor of girls much younger than I am.”
0,I nodded in understanding.
0,"“So, what do you think?"
0,Do you find me attractive?”
0,"“I… I don’t know,” I replied."
0,Evelyn tied the cloth over the wound and sat back against the wall.
0,"“Still too young to have those feelings, then?”"
0,"“That’s not it, or at least, I don’t think it is.”"
0,I sat down in front of her.
0,“I don’t know what it means to be attractive.”
0,"“Okay, how about I reword it."
0,Does my face look good compared to other women you’ve seen?”
0,I sat silent.
0,Evelyn may have taken my silence for my answer as she slouched against the wall.
0,I did not want Evelyn to misunderstand.
0,"“I wouldn’t know,” I told her."
0,Evelyn looked back at me.
0,“Do you have no preference in women?”
0,"“I can’t see people’s faces,” I admitted."
0,"“I can see their head and hair, but it’s like there is a haze over their face."
0,I was not able to notice the scar you pointed out last night until I saw it continue down your chest.” 
0,"I knew this was not the answer she wanted to hear, but there was nothing I could do about it."
0,"I could not comment on her face, but there was a compliment I could give her."
0,"“You do have a nice figure, though.”"
0,Evelyn chuckled.
0,"“You are a strange boy, but I should thank you."
0,"Had you not been there, I may not have survived that fight."
0,"To be honest, this was as far as I had gotten on my first attempt."
0,The sore you must have seen on my back happened early in that attempt.
0,"I had failed to bring adequate medicine, so it began to rot."
0,I turned back and have been battling it over winter.
0,"Without money, it’s hard to get any treatment.”"
0,Rain began to fall.
0,Evelyn stood up and helped me to my feet.
0,“Time to continue.”
0,“In the rain?” I asked.
0,“It helps drown out our footsteps.
0,"I am not certain of where to go from here, but as long as we follow the bodies, we should reach our destination.” "
0,Evelyn tied her hair in the back to keep it from sticking to her face.
0,"I followed her to the edge of the field, but she stopped before reentering the trees."
0,"“It’s a shame,” Evelyn said with a sigh."
0,“What is?”
0,"“This is all fertile land, but because it is infested with warriors in search for the sword, anyone who tries to settle here gets pillaged, much like that farmhouse."
0,"I hope that if not me, someone can get the sword so that this place can be used to sustain life, not end it.”"
0,"Without another word, she entered the woods."
1,“Hold back.”
0,Evelyn pulled me behind a nearby tree.
0,"In the distance, two knights did battle."
0,Their exhaustion was visible.
0,"Attacks lacked vigor, and those that hit only bounced off."
0,"“I think I can handle this,” Evelyn said as she drew her sword."
0,“Stay here.”
0,Evelyn crept ahead moving from tree to tree.
0,"Once closer to the two combatants, she waited."
0,We had been traveling for a couple hours from the time we left the farmhouse.
0,"Like the road I travelled before meeting Evelyn, the woods began to be littered with bodies in increasing number."
0,Evelyn had given me a rag from her bag to tie over my mouth.
0,The risk of disease increased as the bodies piled up.
0,Now it was not uncommon to find a fight.
0,The warriors were converging.
0,We were close.
0,I kept an eye on the surroundings to alert Evelyn if needed.
0,"In a few minutes time, one of the warriors had dealt a blow large enough to leave the other open."
0,"Taking her chance, Evelyn ran in and slew the victor as he landed the finishing blow on the other knight."
0,She signaled me to come.
0,"Like with other warriors Evelyn had defeated, I searched the relative area for their supplies."
0,Our main goal was to find medicine and bandages.
0,"Food was off limits because, as Evelyn explained it, most warriors carried poisoned food with them should their supplies be stolen or they fall in battle."
0,"If they couldn’t aquire the sword, they did not want the other to obtain it either."
0,"When I asked if Evelyn did the same, she answered, “A victor is a victor."
0,"Who am I to deny that?” If the victor who slew her claimed the sword, her hope for the fertile lands would come true."
0,"This time around, I could not find any supplies."
0,"This either meant the warriors had run out, or it was well hidden if not further away than I cared to search."
0,"“Let’s go,” Evelyn said after dragging the bodies to rest against a tree."
0,"Aside from the knight we had encountered at the stream, she had respect for the deceased and would not leave them mangled on the ground."
0,"I had always seen her as valiant, though couldn't help but question the morality of striking down another warrior weakened from what must have been a drawn out struggle, so I thought I'd ask."
0,"""Starting to question coming with me?"""
0,Evelyn asked back.
0,"""No."
0,"It just didn't seem like something you would do."""
0,"""Remember what I told you when you asked if I poisoned my food?"""
0,"""That you didn't?"""
0,"""Why?"""
0,I thought back to our conversation.
0,"""Because a victor is a victor,"" I replied."
0,"""When you first heard me say that, what did you think?"""
0,"""It was noble."""
0,"""If I were to use that same ideology in this instance, how would you view it?"""
0,"""Selfish,"" I answered."
0,Evelyn stopped walking.
0,"""You have just defined the two faced reality of combat."
0,"It's noble, but at the same time selfish."
0,Your perspective is all that changes.
0,"Killing someone is a terrible thing, but if there is a reason for it, does that make it good?"""
0,I could not give an answer.
0,"""When I attacked the man who bought me from my father, was that the right thing do?"""
0,"""Of course,"" I replied."
0,"""Can you say that for certain?"
0,"Say the man died, or even, let us say he lived."
0,I severely injured him and ran away.
0,The purpose of selling me was to gain a better life for my family.
0,"With me gone, what happened to them?"
0,"In the man's spite, did he send my family to the streets?"
0,Kill them?
0,I don't know.
0,I may never know.
0,Was what I did noble because I was protecting my innocence from a man who only wanted to abuse me?
0,"Or was it selfish because I chose myself over the welfare of my mother, father, and two brothers?"""
0,"""I still think it was noble,"" I replied."
0,"""Perspective,"" Evelyn repeated, walking onward again."
0,"""But how does that relate to what you did here?"""
0,"""What would have made that situation noble, not selfish?"""
0,she inquired.
0,"I thought hard about the question, but all I could think of was letting him live."
0,"As if reading my mind, Evelyn continued her explanation."
0,"""I could have let him live."
0,"He did not seem injured, only tired."
0,"An hour's rest would be all he needed, and we would have been that much further ahead of him."
0,But you have to think.
0,What was he after?
0,"What if he had been a grand warrior, the strongest to come upon these lands, and we were fortunate only to catch him at the end of an epic battle with another grand warrior."
0,Letting him live would have insured our eventual demise as well as any other lesser warrior trying for the sword.
0,"Killing him gives us, as well as other weaker warriors a better chance of obtaining our goal and becoming legends ourselves."
0,"Was it selfish or noble?"""
0,I had no more answers to give or words to say against what she did.
0,"""You are rather wise."""
0,Evelyn chuckled.
0,"""If I am, it is only because I take time to think."
0,"Too many people live on whim alone."""
1,"As we journeyed onward, the clash of metal echoed in the distance."
0,It was not a solo encounter but the thundering of battle.
0,"We were close, and it caused my stomach to churn."
0,The tree line broke a hundred yards ahead of us into an expansive field littered with protruding weaponry of all kinds and the bodies they were thrust into.
0,In the center of the field rose an earthen mound.
0,"A solo tree with white flowers stood majestically on top, arching over the mound."
0,Around it fought a multitude of people in a chaotic fray of metal and gore.
0,One could not strike down another without falling himself.
0,Evelyn and I stood at the tree line admiring the brutal display before us.
0,"As the numbers in the center of the field fell, more combatants trickled in from the trees all around the field."
0,"""Are you sure you want to get caught up in this?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Yes, but I want you to stay back and keep hidden."
0,"I can't have you getting in the way."""
0,"""This is madness!"""
0,I yelled.
0,"""Then I will either die mad or return a legend."""
0,"A warrior sprung from the tree line a short distance from us, not noticing we were here, and ran into the field to the fray."
0,"Evelyn was about to take after him, but I grabbed her arm."
0,Evelyn struck me with her bracer knocking me to my back.
0,I sat up as blood from my brow crept into my eye.
0,"""If I turn back now, all the lives I've ended would mean nothing!"""
0,Evelyn ran into the field leaving me in a dazed stupor.
1,"Holding my forehead, I ran along the tree line to where the trees were closest to the mound."
0,"Even there, it was still a couple hundred yards distant."
0,"Evelyn with her light armor caught the heavy clad knights hobbling to the mound and dispatched them with precision, not wasting a single strike."
0,"With every near miss, my heart sank."
0,The thought of someone striking her down with similar ease made me sick.
0,I did not want to see her die.
0,I hugged Evelyn's bag as I sat under an overhanging bush to watch the carnage ensue.
0,Evelyn danced around her opponents with her swift feet jetting from side to side.
0,Her back always faced the forest to prevent someone from coming from behind.
0,"Although there were warriors appearing from the forests around the field, they were few and timed well enough apart."
0,"Evelyn stayed on the outskirts of the battle, whittling down the weaker men who could not fight their way in towards the mound and striking down new arrivals as they appeared."
0,"With Evelyn's swift kills, the numbers began to fall faster than the new arrivals could supplement them, but even at my distance I could tell Evelyn was tiring."
0,Her lunges now seemed more human and her attacks not as precise.
0,Evelyn switched to injuring those she fought with the hope than another warrior would land the finishing blow.
0,"Not a long while later, she was forced to back out of the fray."
0,A sigh of relief escaped me but was short lived.
0,A small group of four combatants noticed her momentary retreat and took chase.
0,"Knowing Evelyn as the reason for the drastic drop in competitors, they teamed up to take on this stronger opponent."
0,I ran onto the field but had to stop myself.
0,"To her, I would only be a liability."
0,I might get her killed.
0,I returned to my bush and buried my head in my arms.
0,"Evelyn continued her spar with the four, and for the first time, I saw her use the thick bracer on her left arm to deflect the strike of one of the knights."
0,"Her agility was not holding up, and it was forcing her to go on the defensive."
0,Hits were landing.
0,"With a solid back-handed swing of her left arm into his helmet, of one of her opponents fell to the ground."
0,One of the remaining three stabbed the fallen man.
0,"Undaunted, the other two continued to work in tandem until the third rejoined."
0,One warrior raised his sword as the other knight stood ready for Evelyn's dodge.
0,"Instead, Evelyn jumped in close to the warrior and caught his arm."
0,"Dropping her weight, she pulled the warrior into the shaft of a spear protruding from a corpse on the ground."
0,"The spear stuck, and the warrior fell aside."
0,Evelyn kicked aside the thrust of the knight and rolled back to her feet.
0,"With two attackers left, she singled out the weaker."
0,"In the midst of her attack, the knight who slew the first kicked in the knee of Evelyn's target."
0,"Her blade had no contest as it plunged into the man's open helmet, but the knight beside him had an open hit on Evelyn."
0,The bracer was not up in time as the sword bounced off it and ran across her upper arm.
0,The blade cut her thin pauldron.
0,Evelyn grabbed the knight by the throat and forced him to the ground.
0,"The knight lifted his sword to strike her down, but Evelyn's blade was faster as it slid through the knight's visor."
0,"Evelyn let go of her sword leaving it erect in the helmet, but did not get up."
1,"Losing all reserve, I ran into the field to Evelyn."
0,"She was kneeling next to the body, holding her arm."
0,Blood ran down staining her white armor red.
0,I dropped the bag beside her and dug out the bandages.
0,"""What are you doing?"""
0,she scowled.
0,"""I told you to stay back."""
0,"""You're hurt!"
0,"You can't go on like this."""
0,I unlatched her pauldron and pulled it off.
0,Some of the metal had dug into her arm from the blow.
0,"Evelyn winced in pain, but did not fight my aid."
0,"""Tie it tight above the cut."
0,"I'll have to make do without my left arm."""
0,I followed her instructions and tied a bandage as high as I could on her arm.
0,"Grabbing the small flask of burning liquid from the bag, I applied the last of it on the cut before bandaging it."
0,Evelyn bit her knuckles to prevent herself from screaming out due to the searing pain it must have cause.
0,"""You can't be thinking of continuing,"" I asked."
0,"""I've come too far to turn back now."""
0,Evelyn stared at the battle near the mound.
0,The numbers had far dwindled with only about a dozen remaining.
0,"Although on our side of the field, new arrivals appeared from time to time, for an unknown reason, none had appeared on the far side for some time now."
0,"""I'm so close."
0,"I need to finish this before the numbers increase again."""
0,"""You're going to die!"""
0,I cried.
0,"""Do you truly think I can't do this?"""
0,Evelyn looked at me.
0,"Though I could not see it, I knew her face echoed the sorrow in her voice."
0,"""You are only human."""
0,I replied.
0,"""You can't do this on your own."""
0,"""But I can't have you helping me either."""
0,Evelyn got to her feet and paused for a moment to regain her resolve.
0,"""I need to do this for myself."""
0,"A warrior, noticing Evelyn was not out of the fight, came charging at us from the mound."
0,"""Why are you being so…"" I stopped myself, noticing what I was about to say."
0,"""Selfish?"""
0,Evelyn finished for me.
0,She removed her sword from the knight's head and held it at chest height in the same stance she used against the iron-clad knight at the stream.
0,"With another inhuman lunge, she caught the man in the chest, the sword plunging with ease through his chainmail."
0,"Removing it and flinging the blood off the tip, she turned to me."
0,"""Perspective."""
0,I ran to her side.
0,"""Then I'll be selfish too."
0,"I'm helping."""
0,"Evelyn, did not voice any complaint."
0,Instead she removed her bracer and knelt down.
0,"""It's too heavy for my arm now."
0,"You can use it."""
0,"While strapping it to my arm, she ran her hand over my bandage."
0,"""Promise me one thing, you won't get yourself killed."""
0,"""That I can promise,"" I said with confidence."
1,We ran together to the mound which now had only six combatants left standing.
0,"Something struck me as odd, so I slowed my pace."
0,Evelyn followed.
0,"Not only had arrivals ceased on the far side of the field, but they now had on our side as well."
0,The remaining combatants both on and off the mound stopped fighting.
0,They had noticed.
0,One pointed off to the east.
0,Walking across the field was the silver knight I had seen from the road.
0,His once shimmering armor was now drenched red.
0,"In confidence, he held out his sword as he walked."
0,One warrior ran atop the mound and began looking around the field.
0,"From our side, an arrow flew through the air and struck the man down in front of the small stone tomb on the center of the mound."
0,Evelyn pulled me to the ground.
0,The silver knight continued his march and another arrow flew into a second combatant.
0,"This time, I was able to see where from."
0,"A couple hundred yards north of us, an archer knelt in tall grass."
0,"His accuracy at that distance was astounding, only aided further by the lack of wind."
0,"""I've heard of these two,"" Evelyn spoke up."
0,"""They are famous mercenaries from the south."
0,"We have fated poorly."""
0,"""You have no chance on the mound with that archer there."
0,"I'll take care of him,"" I suggested."
0,"""You have no chance against him,"" Evelyn warned."
0,"""And you have no chance if he isn't at least distracted,"" I rebutted."
1,"Without a confirmation from Evelyn, I ran back to the tree line then circled north to try and catch the archer from behind."
0,All I had for my protection was my rusted dagger and Evelyn's bracer.
0,"It was foolish for me to think I could take on a famous archer, but for some reason, that didn't matter to me as long as I could protect Evelyn."
0,"With that goal in mind, I ran."
0,"The combatants at the mound had moved to the other side to be free of the archer, but the silver knight was there now ready to do battle."
0,"Evelyn alone stood in the archer's sights as she ran to the hill, but she kept her focus in my direction to watch for any oncoming arrows."
0,The archer took aim and fired.
0,"""Evelyn!"""
0,I yelled.
0,"Evelyn, hearing my call, noticed the arrow flying."
0,She stopped her advance as the arrow flew in front of her and into the ground.
0,"She was safe, but my location had been revealed."
1,The archer now stood and faced me.
0,"His cover exposed, he had no need to hide."
0,I ran for him as he readied another arrow and fired.
0,I put up Evelyn's bracer and blocked the arrow.
0,Its force knocked back my arm making me trip to the ground.
0,The archer nocked another arrow and approached me.
0,"""What makes a child think he could best me?"""
0,he sneered.
0,I got to one knee and held out my rusted dagger.
0,"""I only need to hold you back."""
0,"""So that woman can die by my brother's hands?"""
0,The man laughed.
0,"""The truth is, I'm here only for the fun."
0,My brother was planning on taking the sword on his own.
0,"He doesn't need me for this."""
0,The archer shot an arrow off to his side.
0,A warrior who had just entered the field fell.
0,The archer had another arrow nocked and aimed at me before I could take a step.
0,"""Missed one, it seems."""
0,The archer's accuracy was perfect.
0,Evelyn and I were lucky to have been further ahead of him or we may not have made it this far.
0,"""You did well to get this close, but now you will go no further."
0,Don't fret.
0,"The woman will follow shortly."""
0,I had nothing holding me back now.
0,"With dagger in hand, I charged the archer."
0,"Two steps in and an arrow landed in my chest, yet my feet propelled me forward."
0,"Knowing he had no time to nock another arrow, the archer swung his bow, hitting me across the face with the recurve."
0,"My cheek tore, sending searing pain down my neck, but undaunted I rammed into the archer's stomach."
0,"The archer staggered back, and I fell to my knees."
0,"Where I had stabbed the archer, I was now also bleeding."
0,"Reaching behind me, I broke off the tip of the arrow and pulled it out from the front."
0,"""What are you?"""
0,the archer asked as he pulled out the rusted dagger.
0,I was breathing heavy amidst coughing blood.
0,"""I wish I knew,"" I replied."
0,"Turning to the mound, I ran."
0,"I was weak, my coordination was off, but I moved as fast as my legs would carry me."
0,"Every few steps I had to cough out the blood filling my lungs, but at least the pain bothered me little now."
0,An arrow far overshot my position.
0,"Looking back, the archer was hunched over, supporting himself with one arm as he held his stomach."
0,The archer was of no more a danger.
1,"Once at the mound, I ran on top to the white-flowered tree that overhung the tomb."
0,"On the other side, the silver night had just slew the third remaining competitor."
0,One knight with a shield and Evelyn on one knee stood alone to face the silver knight.
0,"Evelyn's left arm had gone pale and hung limp at her side, and even if she survived the battle, I knew there was no saving her arm."
0,"The silver knight turned to the shield next, leaving who he thought to be the weaker opponent for last."
0,"Evelyn took notice of me, so I hid behind the trunk of the tree to hide my injury."
0,She needed to focus on the battle.
0,"Seeing me, she stood up again and readied her stance once more."
0,I looked at the silver knight and saw great danger in Evelyn attacking him.
0,"Unlike the other knights and warriors she had fought before, the silver knight was in full plate with even his joints covered."
0,"His skill showed years of practice, practice that all but eliminated the lack of movement caused by his heavy armor."
0,The shield blocked the first blow of the silver knight.
0,"Evelyn ran in and shot her sword at the silver knight's helmet, his only weak point should she be able to slip inside the holes in his visor."
0,"The silver knight leaned his head forward, bouncing Evelyn's blade off the top of his helmet."
0,"With his free arm, the silver knight gripped the side of the other knight's shield and pulled it down."
0,"Using his new opening, he plunged his sword into the knight's neck."
0,The silver night stood alone with Evelyn.
0,"""What is a woman doing on a battlefield?"""
0,"the silver knight asked, lifting his visor."
0,"Evelyn, not wanting to waste the opportunity, attacked."
0,The silver knight grabbed her sword mid lunge and pulled it in.
0,"Spinning behind her, the silver knight hit Evelyn in the back of her uncovered shoulder with the pommel of his sword."
0,"Evelyn cried out, but managed to keep standing."
0,The silver knight kept himself at blade's length from her and laughed.
0,"""Your sword style, do you come from the south?"""
0,he asked.
0,"""You do look familiar."
0,"What is your name?"""
0,"Evelyn faced him in silence, scanning for an opening."
0,"""No answer?"
0,Or is it that you have no name?
0,I'll go first.
0,"Gale, son of Gale, blacksmith of Ispwich."""
0,The silver night spread his arms in a mocking bow.
0,"Instead of striking the open target, Evelyn's sword wavered."
0,The silver knight laughed again.
0,"""I'd rather not kill a woman,"" The silver knight laughed."
0,"""There is no reward in defeating something so defenseless."
0,"Let me have the sword and maybe I will use you as my bed warmer."""
0,Evelyn's grip tightened on her sword.
0,"The knight only had time to turn his head as the blade shot at him, catching the bridge of his nose."
0,Evelyn attacked in a relentless fury that gave the silver knight no time to counter.
0,"The speed of her strikes showed no fatigue, no weakness from injury."
0,"Amid preventing a direct blow from the tip of Evelyn's blade, the silver knight managed to close his visor."
0,"Seeing that he in no way could outperform Evelyn in speed, he removed a pike from a corpse as Evelyn readied another strike."
0,"Using the pike's extended reach, he deflected Evelyn and sent her to the mound with a swing of the staff."
0,Evelyn rolled away from the tip as it dug into the slope.
0,The silver knight was now on the offensive.
0,"Keeping Evelyn at a distance, he attacked again and again."
0,"Evelyn danced around the blows, but was unable to counter at such a distance."
0,Exhaustion reared its head as Evelyn's movements slowed.
0,The edge of the pike caught Evelyn in the side.
0,She did not have long.
0,"Evelyn's arm trembled at the weight of her sword, fighting to keep it erect."
0,A swift strike swung down from the pike.
0,"Evelyn stepped aside, but her left arm took the blow, severing below the shoulder."
0,It bled little due to my tie above it.
0,"With one step forward, Evelyn lunged at the silver knight with all her remaining vigor."
0,The tip of her blade pierced a nick in the silver knight's chest armor.
0,The force of impact dropped them both to the ground.
0,Evelyn sat up and placed her knee on the chest of the silver knight.
0,She removed his helmet to look him in the face.
0,"""Who are you?"""
0,the silver knight wheezed.
0,"""I am Amelia, daughter of Gale, blacksmith of Ispwich."""
0,"""Evelyn!"""
0,"I called out, but too late."
0,The silver knight grabbed the broken tip of a spear and stabbed it into Evelyn's side.
0,"""Be damned, bicche!"""
0,Evelyn removed the spear tip and thrust it into the silver knight's head.
0,Evelyn struggled to her feet.
0,I ran over and placed her arm over my shoulder.
0,"""I told you that you wouldn't survive this!"""
0,I yelled at her.
0,"""I'm still alive, aren't I?"""
0,Evelyn replied with a lighthearted tone.
0,"""Help me open the tomb."
0,"I want to at least see inside."""
1,"We walked up the mound, and I set Evelyn down under the flowering tree."
0,"It was then that she noticed my torn cheek and the blood soaking my chest and stomach, more than enough for a fatal wound."
0,"""Are you alright?"""
0,Her question pained me.
0,"""I will survive,"" I replied as tears ran down my face."
0,"I placed my hands on the lid of the tomb, but Evelyn called me back."
0,"""I want to see inside."""
0,"At her command, I helped her to the tomb."
0,"The strength she could supply was little, but with all the force I could muster, we pushed at the lid."
0,The gritty stone creaked as it slid over and off the tomb.
0,Evelyn sat back against the tomb and chuckled.
0,Inside were dozens of swords from many eras and countries.
0,"I lifted a curved saber, and on the blade, just above the hilt, a name was carved, Ymir."
0,"""These swords have names on them,"" I informed Evelyn."
0,"""Read me the names,"" she ordered in a quiet voice."
0,"""This one's Ymir."""
0,"""An eastern king of four centuries past,"" Evelyn replied."
0,"""Two identical swords with Uul and Val written on each."""
0,"""Twin heroes who drew back the barbaric eastern tribes."""
0,Evelyn chuckled again.
0,"""What is the oldest sword you can find?"""
0,I shifted through the swords disregarding the nicks and cuts of the blades against my fingers.
0,"In the corner was a small rusted dagger, the oldest blade I could find."
0,Tied to the handle was a small black stone and written on the blade a single word in a language I had not seen in ages.
0,I handed it to Evelyn.
0,“What does it say?” She asked.
0,"“Legend,” I replied."
0,Evelyn chucked as if coming to some unknown understanding.
0,Evelyn looked at the stone attached to the handle.
0,"""Retrieve my sword."""
0,I ran down the mound to the body of the silver knight.
0,"With sword in hand, I returned to Evelyn."
0,"""Hold it still,"" She ordered."
0,Evelyn carved the name Amelia just above the hilt using the sharp stone.
0,"""Why do you call yourself Evelyn?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Out of respect to the only man to show me kindness."
0,"Jeremiah gave me that name when I told him I had none."""
0,"""And yet you wrote the name given you by your father on the sword?"""
0,"""I kept the name Evelyn out of respect for Jeremiah, but I write my true name out of pride of who I am."""
0,"""Do you want me to place it in the tomb with the others?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""No,"" Evelyn replied."
0,"""How many are watching?"""
0,Evelyn's question took me by surprise.
0,"""What do you mean?"""
0,"""Show me your arm, the one with the bandage."""
0,I held out my arm and Evelyn removed the bloodstained cloth.
0,Beneath it was a soft pink line where the cut from the dagger I deflected had once been.
0,"""I found it strange you never ate."
0,The truth stared me in the face when you could walk around freely with wounds as severe as mine or worse.
0,"I can't believe it took me until death's door to realize it."""
0,I covered my arm.
0,I didn't want to be seen as different.
0,Evelyn wrapped her arm around my neck.
0,"""You have no reason to be ashamed."
0,"Look around and tell me, how many are there."""
0,"Standing up, I looked around the field."
0,What had gone unnoticed now showed as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes.
0,"""Hundreds, maybe thousands."""
0,"The field was covered with men, warriors from countless countries and eras."
0,Their faces were vibrant and clear.
0,"""They are all watching us now, even the silver night."""
0,"""Then I, Amelia, have become legend."""
0,"Amelia pulled my hand, but her grasp was weak."
0,"""And you are too, but you will need a name."""
0,Evelyn had taken pride in her name despite the horrific past that accompanied it.
0,"In my heart, I desired the same."
0,"""Can you give me a name?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""One that I can take pride in?"""
0,Evelyn sat silent for a moment.
0,"""Alexander, for you are the one who protected me."""
0,"Taking the black stone and sword in her lap, on the other side of the blade Evelyn wrote Alexander."
0,"""If you do not want me to place your sword in the tomb, what do you want?"""
0,"""Break the lid,"" Evelyn ordered."
0,"""Break it?"""
0,I repeated.
0,"""Smash it!"
0,Make it so that no one could ever place it back.
0,"I know you have the strength to do it…"" Evelyn's voice faded."
0,I walked to the other side of the tomb and looked at the thick stone lid.
0,I lifted my foot up and stomped it with all my might.
0,The lid fractured.
0,I stomped again and it cracked.
0,"My leg rang out in pain, but I was not going to let that stop me."
0,With tears running down my cheeks I broke the lid.
0,"Larger pieces I broke small, and smaller again."
0,"My feet were bleeding by the end, but the lid lay as a pile of stones."
0,"I returned to Evelyn, now holding the wound in her side."
0,"""Take the swords in the tomb and disperse them over the battlefield,"" Evelyn ordered next."
0,"""But why?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Please, do it for me,"" Evelyn begged."
0,I picked up each sword and tossed them in different directions all around the vast fields.
0,The expressions of the gazes around me from the former warriors were such that I had never seen.
0,"I was desecrating their legacy, their trophy."
0,"""Now,"" Evelyn continued, ""Stab my sword into the center of the tomb."""
0,"I complied, but then returned again to sit in front of Evelyn."
0,"""Why would you have me do this?"""
0,Evelyn gave a weak chuckle.
0,"""I am selfish."""
0,I then remembered what Evelyn had said when we left the burnt farmhouse.
0,"Should she be unable to attain the sword, she wanted someone else to, that way this land could be used for the benefit of others."
0,The sword of legend was a lie.
0,In its place stood a battleground where the victor buried his triumph in the ground only for other victors to see.
0,I kissed Evelyn on the forehead and wrapped my arms around her.
0,"""No, "" I said."
0,"""You are noble."""
0,Evelyn gave no reply.
0,The hand that had been holding her side fell limp to her lap.
0,I took the rubble from the lid and lined the bottom of the tomb the best I could.
0,"The remaining pieces I set around Amelia's sword as a stand, a support."
0,"When finished, I backed away and knelt in front of the noble warrior."
0,"With my hands to my face, I cried."
0,I wanted her back.
0,I wanted her to live.
0,I had the chance to help her.
0,"I couldn't die, but I sat back only as an observer."
0,Arms wrapped around me.
0,A soft pressure rested against my back.
0,"A face nestled against me on my shoulder, and in my mind I heard, ""Thank you."""
0,I stood up and looked behind me.
0,No one was there.
0,All around me the warriors had vanished.
0,The field lay barren once again.
0,The hill fell silent.
0,I was alone.
1,Mud from my boots kicked up into the air as I walked down the worn country road.
0,Year to year much had changed.
0,The once empty countryside was now dotted with farms and fields.
0,I looked to my left at the small farmhouse.
0,The surrounding field had been plowed and seeds were likely resting in the ground ready to grow.
0,"""Are you on your way to the festival?"""
0,To my side a cart stopped.
0,"The driver, a local farmer, looked down at me from his seat."
0,"""I can take you to town if you like."
0,"I'm headed there myself."""
0,I nodded and thanked him.
0,"Walking around to the other side, I stepped up and sat beside him."
0,"""That is an odd bracer,"" he said, looking at my arm."
0,"""Family heirloom?"""
0,"""Something like that,"" I replied."
0,The road bent north around the forest.
1,"In an hour, a bustling town came into view."
0,"In the center, a tall church stood with a bell tower, Christianity, a religion that had become popular of late."
0,The cart entered the town and rode through the busy streets as everyone made preparations for the planting festival.
0,"Once in the town center, in front of the church, I thanked the kind farmer and hopped off the cart."
0,"Light rain was falling, but the populous moved without a care from market stall to market stall buying seeds, jewelry, weapons, food, and whatever else they could find on display."
0,It was a gay occasion.
0,Even I found myself smiling back at the greetings of the passing crowd.
1,I made my way through the market streets to the southern gate.
0,The gate did not lead out of town but to a spacious field surrounded at the forest line by a wall.
0,Two town guards stood watch.
0,"""May I pass?"""
0,I asked the guards.
0,"""Not while the festival is in progress."
0,"We are under direction to keep the field clear to prevent vandalism."""
0,I understood the concern.
0,"In the past during the festival, those jealous of the prosperity of this town had desecrated the monument, but I was not about to let the guards stop me."
0,My hand reached the grip of my thin sword.
0,"""Hold up,"" a voice called from my left."
0,"A familiar town guard, the captain, approached."
0,He stood beside me and placed his hand on my shoulder.
0,"""Do you not know who this boy is?"
0,"He is the sole descendent of Lady Amelia."""
0,The soldiers stepped back.
0,Part of me wished I could have seen their expressions.
0,I turned to the captain.
0,"""Thank you, Karls."""
0,"""No, I must apologize."
0,"I had thought the guards were instructed to let you pass should you come."""
0,"With a nod from the captain, the two guards stepped aside to let me in."
1,The narrow paved path led south strait to the center of the field.
0,"The bodies had long since been cleaned up, the weaponry removed, and the grass was now cared for."
0,It showed a verdant green glistening in the light from a break in the clouds.
0,A white flowering tree sat atop the center mound.
0,The tree had grown tall now that the rage of battle and the bite of weapons did not hinder its growth.
0,I envied it.
0,"In the three hundred years since that battle, I had only aged two by comparison."
0,I was not much taller than I had been then.
0,I walked up the slope and placed my hand on the trunk of the tree.
0,"""I'm back,"" I told it."
0,"Where the tomb once laid now stood a monument, a statue of a female warrior."
0,"At its base was inscribed the words ""Amelia Alexander, Defender of Hope."""
0,I sat down in front and looked up at the likeness of the noble warrior I had once known.
0,"The statue's face was slender, feminine, and did not show the strong will and determination I had known in Amelia."
0,"There was not even a scar on her left cheek, but how was anyone to know?"
0,How was I to know?
0,I had never seen Amelia's face.
0,"It had taken almost fifty years for the word to get out that the sword of legend was no more and another fifty before people began to settle here, but even so, the time did not matter."
0,Amelia's dream had been realized.
0,"This land had become the most prosperous, the most peaceful, and the most joyous territory I had traveled."
0,I stood up and approached the statue.
0,"Placing my hand on it, I was about to thank her for my name and existence as I had done every year I could make it back, but I noticed something behind the base, a small head of hair."
0,On the other side sat a young girl about the age of twelve or thirteen.
0,She sat holding her knees to her chest with her right arm and wore nothing but a ragged cloth.
0,"She looked at me with wide eyes, her mouth hung open."
0,Her face was vibrant and clear.
0,Rain ran down her tan hair like withered grain and dripped off her chin.
0,This was no apparition; she was alive.
0,"""Amelia?"""
0,"I asked, thinking I had gone insane."
0,"The girl stood up, confirming my suspicion."
0,Her left arm was missing.
0,I embraced the girl and cried.
0,Her arm wrapped around me and grasped my tunic.
0,"""Alexander…"""
