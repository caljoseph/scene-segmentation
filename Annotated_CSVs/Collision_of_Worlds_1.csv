0,"Collision of Worlds 
Invasion
Part 1
By Michael DeBuse"
0,What do Gods fear?
0,"An unexpected force appeared, a creation of one not divine,
An infestation of worlds."
0,"Some vanquished the plague, but many worlds fell."
0,"Only one world endured and remained infected, Whinhlem."
0,A proposition came from the God of Whinhlem.
0,Interference between worlds was banned.
0,"No God shall harm another God, nor their world."
0,"All agreed, so that none could repeat the disaster."
0,"A law of isolation was passed, a dire punishment affixed,
For a taboo that should never be broken."
0,What caused the Gods such fear?
0,The Lurr.
0,"Chapter 1
“The more complicated the formula, the more unexpected the results.”
Emer"
1,Dim orange light illuminated a cluttered desk covered in wrinkled and torn parchment and intricate brass measuring instruments.
0,"Faintly glowing, polychromatic gemstones showered specks of color on two pocket watches whose times were ever so slightly off from each other."
0,"The only sounds in the room were the scratching of a quill and the low mumbling of the room’s owner, Emer."
0,"Tearing another sheet of vellum in half and tossing it to the side, he exhaled his frustration."
0,"The amount of wasted vellum on the floor was enough to make even the least frugal onlooker angry, especially his personal maid, Dyas, who would have to clean it in the morning."
0,She had already given him a few choice words with a weary yet understanding smile as she delivered a small cup of tea before retiring for the evening.
0,"After pecking him lightly on the cheek, of course."
0,"Emer was used to her flirtatious nature, so he was not startled by the sudden sign of affection, unfitting for a maid."
0,"If anything, she made the cold, gray-marble room feel a bit warmer."
0,"The other palace servants saw Dyas as a necessary contrast to Emer’s habitual pessimism, something she claimed she would remedy one day."
0,"Emer retrieved a large, corked vial from the bottom drawer of his desk."
0,He unstopped the hole and poured the black liquid into the small inkwell that had run low.
0,This was his second refill of the night.
0,"“I am a scholar, not an instructor,” Emer mumbled to himself as he returned the vial to the drawer."
0,"He felt a tightness in his temples each time he looked at a new blank page, gripping ever heavier as the evening drew late."
0,Emer leaned back in his wooden chair intricately carved from the trunk of a tree and took a sip of the sour tea.
0,The herbs used in the brew were a special arrangement created by Dyas to help keep him awake and focused while he worked.
0,Having an apothecary’s daughter for a maid came with simple benefits like this.
0,He looked up at the extravagant etched-glass windows behind his desk as he exhaled his self-doubt with the warmth of the tea.
0,"The etchings depicted the movement of the stars, moons, and planets."
0,"Another exhale passed his thin lips, this time to release his feelings of inadequacy."
0,"The windows were a creation of his superior and former master, Evhial, a High Elf and gravity specialist who served as the court magician for Emperor Yuro Amel until her abrupt passing two years ago."
0,Years on Whinhlem were already long—long enough for an infant to reach adulthood after only experiencing three summers—but those years felt even longer in Evhial’s absence.
0,Every thought of Emer’s superior was another reminder of just how superior she was to him in every conceivable way.
0,"Evhial built the windows as a replacement for the sky that would have otherwise been visible if not for the poorly placed and grandiose bastion obstructing any and all view from her office, now his office."
0,"So long as he periodically recharged the etched glass with raw ven, the natural energy that fueled magic, the etchings would react directly to the minute shifts in the unique gravitational pulls of each heavenly body, tracking and following them as they moved across the sky with utmost precision."
0,It was a complex magical technology that had never existed before Evhial’s time.
0,Superior…
0,Emer observed the etchings on the glass hoping that somehow the brilliance of his late master would inspire a similar brilliance in him.
0,"He often doubted himself, and there were many who shared in those doubts due to his lineage and inexperience."
0,"He recalled when he received candidacy for the position of court magician, the highest magical position in the Amelian Empire."
0,"When his appointment came to council discussion after Evhial’s death, he was not able to raise his voice in defense against the dissenting opinions speaking of tradition and pure heritage, let alone he being sixteen years of age, well into adulthood but still far too young for anyone to see him as experienced in magic, or at least experienced enough to hold such an esteemed position."
0,"Plus, the position of court magician had traditionally been held only by High Elves."
0,"Emer was High Elf in appearance, but only half by blood."
0,He was much shorter.
0,His father was a fairy.
0,"Fairies tended to have a strong affinity to only a single element, which would have eliminated his chance of being court magician, a position that required at least an affinity to the four basic elements and one rare element."
0,"The fortune of his birth gave him the affinities of both his mother and father which when combined totaled not only the four basic elements of water, earth, fire, and wind, but also the rare affinities of spatial and life magic, life magic being a common affinity for High Elves."
0,"His sudden call to candidacy, the only candidate, came as a surprise."
0,"Candidates were always selected after years of investigation and assessment, but Emperor Yuro ordered the selection be made immediately after Evhial’s death."
0,His reason?
0,"He did not want to delay the magic education of First Princess Eydis FeAmel, a task given to none other than the court magician."
0,Emer recalled the unspoken urgency hidden behind his emperor’s eyes.
0,"Emperor Yuro’s reasoning felt shallow to the royal council, and many demanded the call be postponed for another four years at the least until a more suitable body of candidates could be cultivated."
0,“Appoint him.”
0,A crisp but young voice echoed across the hall of Emer’s memory.
0,"Eydis FeAmel, who would eventually become the empress of the Amelian Empire, then only an adolescent of two and a half years old but far enough in her education to sit in council, silenced the dissenters."
0,Emer’s appointment was ratified by only a slight margin.
0,"Slight, but slight was enough."
0,"He would spend his life serving her, so her blessing was all the convincing that the council needed."
0,"Shortly after his appointment was ratified, Emer learned that the first princess had an affinity to spatial magic, his specialization."
0,"Evhial had made the discovery shortly before her passing during a clandestine trip on the princess’s order to visit Evhial’s associate, a trow geneticist, on some matter of secrecy."
0,"Princess Eydis’s spatial affinity had been kept secret from the council, including that it was Emperor Yuro himself who had given Emer the candidacy while rejecting all others."
0,"Even now, the number of people who knew was few."
0,"In Emer’s opinion, such a discovery should be celebrated."
0,Spatial magic was a rare affinity.
0,"Much of Emer’s time over the following two years until this evening was devoted to teaching Eydis, more out of gratitude for her support in his appointment than any obligation of his position."
0,Eydis was a bright youth whose intelligence shone even more brilliantly as she grew to adulthood over those two years.
0,She had mastered both wind and life magic under Evhial.
0,"She finished her academics in one year, half the expected time."
0,"All the while, she was forced by Emperor Yuro to train with the palace guards until her martial instructor, Symra, demanded that the grueling conditioning end."
0,"No longer required to train with the soldiers, Eydis spent her meager free time learning every language and dialect of the empire, numbering over one hundred in total, solely out of boredom."
0,Now she was learning spatial magic faster than Emer could create lessons for her.
0,The lesson he gave her earlier that morning was insufficient.
0,"Although she did not voice a complaint, her face spoke volumes."
0,Boredom.
0,Her thoughts were elsewhere.
0,His lessons were not challenging enough for her.
0,The first few lessons caused Eydis to bubble with joy.
0,Her face radiated in cheery youthful beauty with each new discovery.
0,She would grab him by his hands and plead for him to teach her more.
0,Emer tore another sheet of vellum and tossed it to the floor; another lesson plan Emer felt was inadequate.
0,"She was the first person who ever made Emer feel adequate, and he chased that fleeting feeling every day."
0,That was why he struggled so.
0,"So long as he had something to teach her, he could spend time with her."
0,"So long as she found him useful, he could support her."
0,"Everything that Emer was, he wanted to give to Eydis FeAmel."
1,CRASH!
0,A pane of glass shattered in Emer’s mind and the recoil of ven numbed his body.
0,This feeling… 
0,Something or someone had forcefully broken the anti-teleportation barrier Emer set around the palace.
0,"Springing to his feet with enough force to knock his heavy chair prone, Emer readied a warm thermal energy in his hand."
0,"Feeding it two separate yet similar compositions of fire ven, his hand burst into two distinct flames."
0,"Once the two flames were formulated to alternate in intensities, Emer flipped the latch, opened the window, and launched the flare into the sky."
0,The combined flames pulsated between subdued yellow and vibrant orange: the signal that there was an intruder in the palace.
0,"Before the flare could reach the apex of its climb, another flare ascended pulsating red and purple."
0,“Protect the royal family.” 
0,This was an assassination.
0,The red and purple flare was only used when danger directly targeting Emperor Yuro or his family was discovered.
0,There was a high likelihood that someone in the palace had already died.
0,The door to Emer’s office burst open.
0,"“Hostile intruder,” the guard yelled."
0,“Go to the emperor!”
0,Spatial magic was a purely defensive and powerful support element.
0,"From barriers to escape, the school of magic was vital to the protection of the royal family, and those within the palace who were charged with providing this protection were the Namie, an order of spatial magic specialists."
0,Emer’s position as the court magician and being a spatial magic expert made him not only a Namie but also their leader and magic instructor.
0,His role was to head directly to the emperor and evacuate him at the first sign of threat.
0,Emer recalled at lightning speed his memorized teleportation formula targeting the Emperor’s personal chambers.
0,He thrust his fingers into the air in front of him.
0,"The tips vanished, or more accurately penetrated the space in front of him, leaving translucent cracks from where his fingers disappeared."
0,"He pulled his hand to the side, tearing the space away in front of him, and threw himself into the rift-like portal cracking vertically through the air."
1,He landed in an extravagant but dimly lit lounge.
0,A sword rested its edge against his throat but was promptly removed.
0,"“You’re too late,” the captain of the royal guard growled."
0,“Too late?” Emer repeated.
0,Only a few seconds had passed between the destruction of the barrier surrounding the palace and Emer’s arrival in the emperor’s chambers.
0,The captain’s teeth squeaked under grinding pressure that could crack them at any moment.
0,"The glare of the captain’s grey, bloodshot eyes drew Emer to attention, their intimidation worsening the worming tension Emer felt coiling in his stomach."
0,“We are dealing with a spatial mage.
0,There was no break-in.
0,He must have teleported directly here.”
0,"The captain ordered his men to rally the Namie and hasten to ensure the safety of the remaining two wives of the emperor, the first princess, and the two young princes."
1,He then pulled Emer by the arm through a long corridor towards the emperor’s bedchamber.
0,“No physical weapon could do this.
0,What do you make of it?”
0,On the bed rested the severed bodies of Emperor Yuro and his first and second wife braided together in what had been a passionate evening.
0,There was no spray of blood from the strike of any weapon.
0,What blood flowed from their bodies avoided a thin line running through the severed trio.
0,"Emer’s stomach knotted, not from the brutality of the scene but because he had failed in the most important task demanded of him by his position."
0,He reached for the space between the severed bodies and felt solid resistance although no obstruction was visible in the dark.
0,"Drawing ven into his hand, he made it resonate at a high frequency."
0,Touching the invisible object again weakened and dissipated it.
0,“A barrier?
0,Impossible.” 
0,Barriers made from spatial magic prevented passage or entry.
0,"They could move and push and potentially bludgeon if the mage was skilled enough, but they could never hold a form sharp enough to cut."
0,"Even if placed through someone, the barrier would only hold them bound."
0,Emer had never heard of such magic.
0,"Cold sweat ran down past Emer's thin brow, stinging his eyes."
0,His heart raced and threatened to beat out of his chest.
0,Emer was the strongest spatial mage in the Amelian Empire.
0,"Once he became court magician, his first task was to replace the outdated encryption methods to strengthen the palace’s anti-teleportation barrier."
0,"It had taken him a large portion of his first year as court magician to complete, and the resulting barrier became multiple magnitudes harder to breach."
0,"Brute forcing the encryption would take centuries, yet someone had managed it in less than a year."
0,"Now having seen a barrier used as a weapon, there was no doubt in Emer’s mind."
0,This mage had a mastery of spatial magic incomparably superior to his.
0,"Ignoring the captain’s questions about what weapon killed the emperor or how barriers were involved, Emer strung together another teleportation formula in his mind and tore open a portal to the first princess’s chambers."
0,He had to make sure she was safe.
0,He had to protect her.
0,"Instead of the portal creating a direct window to the location, the destination clouded over."
0,"Emer tried to enter the rift, but it forced him back."
0,The first princess’s bedchamber was surrounded by a teleportation barrier.
0,The signature of the ven was different than what he would recognize as hers.
0,Emer placed his hand on the rift to read the flow of the foreign ven for clues about the barrier’s nature.
0,"Constructing a strong teleportation barrier took a long time, so one created in seconds should be weak."
0,At least he hoped it would be weak.
0,Superior.
0,The haunting thought would not leave his mind.
0,"Sure enough, the encryption was one Emer could decrypt in a minute at most, but it was not one an average Namie could break easily."
0,Emer was the only one who could reach her.
0,"“Princess Eydis is in trouble,” he told the captain."
0,“Guards should be there.”
0,“They will not be able to enter.” 
0,"Working the decryption in his mind, Emer forced spatial ven of the correct intensity and frequency pattern to disrupt the barrier."
0,"The barrier was too complex to remove, but he only needed to weaken it enough to allow passage."
0,"Even so, it would still take time."
0,He could only pray for Eydis’s safety as he worked.
0,What madness would drive someone to directly target the Amelian royal family?
0,"They were personally favored by the titan Bydrofe, the Guardian of Whinhlem."
0,"Emperor Yuro had yet to present his heir to Bydrofe--traditionally done when the heir reached three years of age, becoming an adult, wherein Bydrofe would impart his wisdom and a blessing--but a delay in the first princess’s presentation would not remove his favor."
0,To attack the royal line was the same as making an enemy of the greatest entity on Whinhlem.
1,"As the barrier waned, the struggle on the other side grew visible."
0,The first princess’s room crumbled as near-invisible planar projectiles struck the white-marble walls and exquisite wooden furniture.
0,"They cut through with no resistance and sent broken shrapnel falling to the white, wool-carpeted floor."
0,"Not a single piece of furniture remained undamaged, and the outward-facing wall had already fallen revealing the cold night sky."
0,At the center of the destruction stood First Princess Eydis FeAmel.
0,"She wore only her night skirt, now tattered from her frantic defense against an assailant not visible from the portal’s angle."
0,"Heavy bruising coated her torso, arms, and legs."
0,A cloudy film was amassed on her arms and legs and blurred the details of her body.
0,The princess understood the nature of her assailant’s attacks and coated her body in spatial magic vibrating at high frequencies.
0,"She punched and kicked the planar projectiles that she could not avoid, the perfect combination of Emer’s spatial magic instruction and Symra’s martial training in full display."
0,"The barriers her unseen assailant flung at her weakened from contact with her vibrating spatial defenses, but her magic only removed the edge."
0,"The impact still had a visible effect, knocking her back and adding to her countless welts and bruises."
0,"Emer felt great pride in his pupil’s ingenuity and insight, but if he did not hurry, she would not last."
0,The princess was on defense doing all she could to keep herself from being cut.
0,"Having seen the effect these barrier weapons had on the emperor and now the stone walls cut through effortlessly, Emer knew only one would be enough to end her life."
1,“That should be enough.” 
0,The captain drew his sword with Emer’s consent and charged into the rift.
0,Emer followed behind.
0,The sensation of passing through the weakened barrier was akin to trudging through thick mud that clung to his robe as if trying to hold him back when he exited the portal into the princess’s chambers.
0,A human dressed in a simple brown robe tied with a thin black sash stood in the air.
0,"He looked more like a monk or scholar than an assassin, but having already seen the effects of this assassin’s magic, Emer knew he was a master of his craft."
0,The captain charged the assassin while Emer ran for the princess.
0,"Surprised by their sudden appearance, that someone had infiltrated his barrier so quickly, the assassin’s barrage ended."
0,The princess quickly utilized the small moment of opportunity to release a wind spear at the intruder with a swing of her arm.
0,Emer felt the distinct sensation of spatial magic use just before the wind spear hit.
0,It dissipated before reaching its target.
0,The assassin set up a defensive barrier around himself.
0,"Even with his help, Emer knew they would be unable to fight the assassin."
0,He lacked confidence that he could penetrate any defensive barrier created by this human.
0,"“Princess, this way!” "
0,Emer grabbed the princess’s arm and ran towards the collapsed wall.
0,The captain stood between them and their attacker to delay the assassin as much as was possible.
0,"With a swipe of the attacker’s hand, a barrier cut through the captain’s sword and severed him in half diagonally from shoulder to hip."
0,It continued towards Emer and the princess unobstructed.
0,Emer pulled the princess through the rubble and out her bedchamber into a freefall.
0,"Quickly formulating a simple, short-distance teleportation formula, Emer tore open the air below them."
1,They landed hard on the lightly domed roof of the Temple of the Gods across the east courtyard from the princess’s chambers.
0,"The princess rubbed her side and shoulder, aching terribly from the hard impact on her many bruises, but her attention quickly drew away from her own injuries."
0,“Your arm!”
0,“Ignore it.” 
0,Crimson ran in a constant stream from what had been Emer’s left arm.
0,He gripped the bloody stub with his hand just above where his elbow once attached and forced life magic into it.
0,"The veins fused closed, stopping the deep red fountain, and the searing pain numbed until it became bearable."
0,The brief seconds of rapid blood loss made his head light and his body cold.
0,He blinked a few times to fight past the pain but noticed the princess shivering in the cold winter air.
0,He removed his robe and placed it on the princess’s shoulders.
0,"Eydis was a whole head and a half taller than Emer, so the robe was not long enough to reach any further than her knees, about the length of her shimmering brown, silken night skirt, but it would provide some warmth."
0,“We must seek time for me to prepare the long-distance teleportation for your escape.”
0,"The emergency escape teleportation formula was deliberately overcomplicated to prevent others from following the ven trace left behind by the portal, and he needed time to ensure whether his memory of the complicated formula, recalled while fighting back the haunting ache of his missing arm and the onset of shock, had any errors."
0,Mistakes in teleportation could be fatal.
0,"While Emer recalled the formula, a portal opened behind them, and the assassin appeared."
0,"Instead of casting the escape spell as he recalled it, he formulated another quick, short-distance teleportation and pulled the princess through before their assailant could attack."
1,"After landing on the grounds on the opposite side of the temple annex, Emer grasped her wrist."
0,They bolted into a sprint over the tightly cobbled path as fast as their legs could carry them.
0,Emer had no destination in mind.
0,He only needed a short window of time.
0,The palace guards who saw them ran to catch up and aid in the princess’s protection.
0,"Emer once again began checking over the escape formula and already found one mistake that he promptly remedied, but he made little further progress when another portal opened in front of them."
0,“Slow him down!” Emer shouted to the guards.
0,"He stomped his heel into the ground, and a wall of rock and earth shot up between him and the portal to stall their pursuer, if stalling was even possible against such a mage."
1,He then created another short-distance teleportation formula and pulled the princess through to the central courtyard of the palace.
0,Eydis shrieked.
0,"Her younger twin brothers lay severed in half in their own gore, murdered while still in the prime of their childhood."
0,"Eydis’s hardened expression from her martial training vanished, replaced by creeping fear."
0,"She had never witnessed the death of a loved family member, especially a death so violent."
0,"As hard as her conditioning under Symra was, little could prepare her for such a sight."
0,Emer chastised himself internally for his lack of forethought.
0,"The twin princes always dueled in the courtyard in the evening, and there would certainly have been a chance that the assassin would notice them."
0,"They may have been the first to die, being out in the open."
0,The emergency flare that was launched shortly after his came from the direction of this courtyard.
0,Numerous guards and servants observed the bodies while medical staff futilely investigated them.
0,"Nothing could be done for the dead in such a state, even with life magic."
0,Emer continued checking over his escape formula and almost finished before a portal opened right where they had exited.
0,"The assassin appeared to the astonishment and screams of those in the courtyard, so Emer pulled the princess through another portal."
1,They exited inside the palace’s great hall.
0,Emer pulled Eydis in the direction of one of the many entryways lining its breadth.
0,"Once again, the stationed guards joined them in their flight."
0,The patter of bare feet and clacking of hardened boots echoed over the carved marbled walls where the deep redwood accents did little to dampen the sound.
0,"Emer now knew he could no longer use his escape formula, not as he had memorized it."
0,"“He said I brought this upon myself… that I was the last one,” Princess Eydis said in shock."
0,“My brothers… Are… You are supposed to evacuate my father.
0,How is my father?
0,My mother?”
0,The swiftness and lethality of the offensive barrier magic meant there was a high chance that the assassin could have finished off the remaining wives of the emperor in the time it took for Emer to investigate the emperor’s corpse.
0,"“Your father and his first two wives, your mother… are dead."
0,"If that is what he said, we can trust the others are as well.”"
0,Color slowly drained from Eydis’s face.
0,“What about Ceil?
0,Her marriage to my father has not been made public.
0,He could not have known about her.”
0,Emer did not know.
0,Ceil’s maid was a Namie.
0,"She was the only member of the royal family ordered to have a Namie in her presence at all times, so perhaps she alone escaped."
0,"Just as they exited the hall, a portal appeared, and the assassin saw the direction of their flight."
1,"Emer pulled the princess through another quickly formed portal, leaving the guards of the hall to sacrifice themselves as the others likely had."
0,Emer’s fears were correct.
0,The assassin was tracing his teleportation far too easily.
0,"Even though a trace of the formula was left behind by every portal at its source location, it was not so easy to read."
0,The assassin was reading them as if they were nothing more than a brief memo.
0,"If he used the escape formula, with his assessment of the assassin’s competence in spatial magic, again being reminded how superior it was to his own, Emer knew the assassin would simply follow."
0,Perhaps if he stayed behind to erase the trace… But then he would not likely have time to fully erase it before the assassin killed him.
0,"Even partially erased, the assassin could glean the destination coordinates and create his own formula."
0,"However, that was the best and only option."
0,"For the plan to work, his escape formula would need to change further."
0,Emer altered the formula he had just finished checking over.
0,He added another few layers of complexity including destination randomization.
0,"Next, he removed distance limitations so he could send her as far away as was possible within his power."
0,"At the same time, he set destination restrictions, including one to force the location to a populated city that was non-aggressive."
0,Such detailed restrictions for a randomized portal were not simple to infuse into a formula.
0,Emer’s pace slowed as they ran down a corridor on the upper levels of the palace.
0,Constructing such a complicated formula while simultaneously creating smaller formulas to aid them in their flight caused extreme mental strain.
0,This was only compounded by the disorientation from his mind slowly succumbing to shock and the perpetual lightheadedness from loss of blood.
0,"“H… how,” Princess Eydis stuttered."
0,“How can a human be that powerful?
0,Their ven levels and affinities are far too weak to keep up an attack that long.
0,Along with all the teleportation…
0,"If he was a minum, it might be plausible, but--” "
0,"Another portal opened in front of them, not at the destination of his last portal like before."
0,The assassin knew the layout of the corridor and that it did not branch.
0,"With how quickly the assassin killed the rest of the royal family, he likely knew the layout of the entire palace."
0,Emer’s last portal had placed Eydis on a path the assassin could intercept.
0,This was a grave mistake.
0,"The assassin exited the portal and immediately launched his barrier attack, only this time it was not sharp but wide and blunt with intense, pulsating energy."
0,"Emer set up a barrier, but it shattered the moment the pulse touched it."
0,"He coated his arm and shoulder in vibrating spatial ven, but the barrier did not dissipate on impact."
0,It continued with force and knocked Emer into the princess.
0,They both flew back to the floor.
0,Emer grabbed the princess to keep her from sliding away from him over the smooth marble.
0,"“Thought that might work,” the human said in a relaxed but playful tone in perfect Elven."
0,“I should look into making a stronger version.”
0,There were no guards to delay the assassin.
0,"He and the princess were alone, but Emer did not panic."
0,"A rare, confident smile grew on his face."
0,He finished the formula.
0,Emer prayed to the memory of his late master that he had not made an error in its construction.
0,"So long as the princess exited somewhere unhostile to the elves, someone would lend her aid."
0,Emer grabbed the princess and pulled her close.
0,“I don’t know where you will exit.
0,I will stay behind and scramble the trace so he cannot follow.
0,"If I die first, he should still find it difficult to pursue you."
0,"Wherever you appear, find help quickly.”"
0,"Emer activated the finished escape formula and tore the rift open below the princess, forcing her to fall into the portal."
0,His ven levels plummeted faster than he had ever experienced before.
0,"Something about the black portal he created drained the majority of his ven, leaving only what was necessary to keep his body functioning."
0,The dregs of Emer’s remaining ven would only be sufficient to scramble and erase the portal.
0,"Afterwards, he would have none left to protect himself, not that he had any confidence in his ability to survive."
0,"In haste, Emer channeled ven into the rift which began to warp, crack, and then collapse like shattered glass."
0,"Expecting to be quickly executed by the superior spatial mage before him, Emer instead saw wide, bewildered eyes."
0,"The portal vanished, and soon after, so did the trace."
0,An exhausted smile spread across Emer’s face.
0,I won.
0,A spatial mage of the attacker’s mastery would know that following the princess was impossible now.
0,“To think there is someone in this world capable of that level of teleportation.
0,Is it not taboo on Whinhlem?
0,You had better pray that you did not send her to some inhospitable world.
0,"Although if you did, my job would be finished here and now.”"
0,The assassin praised Emer.
0,Emer’s joy twisted into confusion.
0,He did not know what the human meant by him sending the princess to an inhospitable world.
0,"The destination was randomized, but he placed restrictions on where the exit could appear."
0,"“But, I assume you are not so incompetent."
0,I will only have to trace where you sent her to make certain she is dead.”
0,"This man was a skilled spatial mage, far more skilled than Emer, but the thought that this human could still trace the princess’s destination after the portal and trace were erased was absurd."
0,The assassin replied as if he knew the cause of Emer’s confusion.
0,"“The lingering trace may be gone, but the formula trace can still be found in you."
0,I will have you come with me.”
0,The trace remains in the caster?
0,"This concept was unknown to every spatial scholar Emer had ever met, both inside and outside the empire."
0,How could that be possible?
0,"Even if it was, how could one extract the trace?"
0,Just how much more advanced was this human’s knowledge of spatial magic than the Amelian Empire’s leading spatial magic expert?
0,What have the humans of Tolmyur been hiding during their decade of ceasefire with the Empire?
0,"No matter the answer to these questions, Emer realized that he only had one option."
0,"When someone died, ven in the body dissipated."
0,The trace had to be remnants of ven used for the spell somewhere inside the body.
0,There could be no other option.
0,"He had to do something, but his ven was too low for his body to draw from."
0,"Emer forced his ven below the critical levels, drawing from the reserves of ven his body needed to sustain itself, and channeled it into his hand."
0,"He only needed a little, and a little was all his body would give him."
0,The small pulse of electric energy in his hand crackled like static.
0,The princess would be safe.
0,The assassin would not reach her.
0,"Now at the end of Emer’s short life, amid mistakes and struggles, he finally felt for the very first time that he performed his duty well."
0,Emer’s body shuddered and fell to its side.
0,His left eye rolled back into his head from the shock he sent through his body.
0,"Chapter 2
“The Hidden Princess”
Eydis"
1,Lies.
0,"Eydis tapped an annoyed finger on the arm of her padded lounge chair as she watched her maid leave, the sullen palace guards closing the door behind her."
0,"She never understood this odd ability she had, but she knew when people were lying."
0,Something about their scent or heartrate betrayed secrets her few caretakers desired to keep hidden.
0,"They spoke to her with calm demeanor after she awoke, when they bathed her, and when they brought her morning meal, but something about their expressions felt off."
0,"The maid who cleaned Eydis’s quarters just now was particularly troubled, but when Eydis asked with genuine concern what was the matter, her maid simply replied, “All is well with me.”"
0,"That statement was truth, suggesting the problem that kept her retainers on edge or depressed existed elsewhere."
0,Eydis had her suspicions.
0,Something happened yesterday in the palace.
0,She faintly saw the glow of an orange and yellow flare from her window.
0,She heard shouts and wails and hastened padded footsteps of servants and the clanking metal of guards.
0,An officer of the guard reached the door to her quarters after the height of the commotion had passed but was called back before he opened.
0,She heard but a single brief exchange in a subdued voice her keen ears could easily snatch from the other side of the cold marble.
0,“Should we bring her out?”
0,"“No, it’s too late now."
0,But we might need her later.”
0,"For as long as Eydis could remember, she had never left her quarters."
0,Every regality was provided to her in the confines of her living space.
0,"She was well educated in language and etiquette and magic, fed the highest quality cuisine, and given the most elegant of dresses."
0,She was taught a deep love and responsibility for her country and people whom she would eventually lead and protect.
0,She had servants on call for all her needs.
0,"She had everything she could ever want as First Princess of the Amelian Empire, everything except the freedom to walk out her guarded door."
0,Eydis was taught that the First Princess was forbidden to show herself until the day she wed or took her position as empress.
0,That was one of the first lies her retainers taught her.
0,"When she grew the courage to challenge the claim to her instructor whom she thought would delight in her desire to seek the truth, the grizzled old High Elf simply shook his head and replied, “Emperor Yuro has ordered that you remain here until your time.” That was not a lie."
0,"Eydis could not deny she felt excited when the guard spoke of taking her from her room, but what purpose would she have if what happened last night was indeed an emergency?"
0,Perhaps they planned to evacuate her.
0,"But then why was it “too late” once the trouble passed instead of “safe” or “unnecessary?” What did the officer of the guard mean by saying they “might need her later?” She had so many questions, and each she asked throughout the morning was returned either with a lie or a well-constructed truth that deflected away from the actual truth."
0,She could do little about the deflections.
0,She had grown accustomed to such things but loathed them all the same.
0,Why couldn’t people be honest?
0,Eydis stood to walk off the unease in her stomach.
0,"The commotion last night and the sullen demeanor of her caretakers was part the cause, but it was not the only cause."
0,"Despite having eaten after her morning bath, she still hungered."
0,Or perhaps it was not quite hunger.
0,She craved something.
0,She leaned against the side of the single crystalline window of her lounge to look out into the back corner of the palace’s east garden while she pieced apart her typical morning routine to find out what was missed.
0,"Her craving led to food, which in turn led to her breakfast."
0,There the missing piece was found.
0,"Perhaps due to last night’s commotion, the chef staff chose to pair with her meal the most exquisite of fine wine."
0,"A rare treat indeed, since she had never before imbibed."
0,"However, the wine replaced her usual morning beverage, and the more she thought on it, the stronger the unease in her stomach grew."
0,That was what she craved.
0,"Perhaps in the unease of last night’s events, her body wanted the comfort of habit."
0,Eydis walked to her door to address the guards on the other side.
0,"“Afen, summon one of the chef staff for me.”"
0,"“Certainly, your Highness,” the guard replied."
0,Eydis returned to her padded lounge chair and eagerly awaited the usual servant.
0,He barely made it through the door before Eydis addressed him.
0,"“I am most grateful for the wine you provided with my morning meal, but I would still like my usual drink."
0,Can you bring it to me?”
0,The slender man’s face grew pale enough to match the color of his antler-like horns that sprouted near his temples and circled the sides of his head like half-crowns.
0,Eydis heard his heartrate increase and noticed the near-imperceptible odor of his sweat grow in the air.
0,She knew another lie would follow.
0,"“I apologize, your Highness, but we have run out of stock.”"
0,"Surprisingly, that was not a lie, but it was not the entire truth either."
0,How could a beverage that Eydis received every morning without fail since as long ago as she could remember suddenly now run out of stock?
0,The suppliers of the palace should always keep excess of all foods to meet the sudden whims of the fickle royalty.
0,She had a hunch.
0,“Is the shortage due to the events of yesterday night?” she asked.
0,"“No, your Highness,” he replied promptly, almost afraid."
0,"That was a lie, as clear as if he admitted it himself, but Eydis could not antagonize the terrified man who had served her so perfectly until now."
0,"Whatever the reason may be, the circumstances were clearly not under his control."
0,"“So, your stock vanished last night."
0,"That is a pity,” Eydis replied with a light smile to show she held no ill will towards the man."
0,"Perhaps the source of the drink was such a rare and valuable substance that made obtaining it worth burglarizing the palace, an improbable explanation yet possible nonetheless."
0,“Please make every effort to resupply.
0,It is my favorite drink.”
0,"“Certainly, your Highness."
0,However… it may take time before we can procure more.”
0,Truth.
0,“Understood.
0,You may be on your…”
0,Eydis’s words trailed off.
0,"She rushed to her window and peered up over the trees of the garden to smoke growing in the distance, first as whisps in the light breeze then into columns and billowing plumes."
0,"As the sky greyed, faint howls of terror crept into her keen ears."
0,“We’re under attack!” a palace guard called from the hall outside her door.
0,“Humans in the city!”
0,“In the city?
0,"How?” Eydis called back, rushing to her door."
0,Now the events of last night made sense.
0,"Amel might have been under attack last night, but her caretakers kept this a secret to not worry her."
0,"They held confidence in their ability to repel the attack, but now the enemy neared the palace."
0,“We must act!
0,We must protect the people!” she ordered.
0,"As future empress, her duty was first and foremost the safety and prosperity of her people."
0,She reached for the handle of her door but hesitated to open it.
0,"Her father, the emperor, had forbade her from leaving this room."
0,Did his decree hold in an emergency such as this?
0,The ongoing cries of her people that she knew only she could hear grew louder and louder in her mind.
0,Innocent people were dying at this very moment.
0,This was not the time for hesitation.
0,"Eydis pulled her door open, ripping it from the tight grip of her guard."
0,"“We cannot stand here and do nothing,” she said to her stunned guard."
0,The two guards exchanged glances and reached an unspoken agreement.
0,"“Follow me,” Afen said, leading Eydis down the marble hallway."
1,Turning right led to a window-lined corridor with a pointed arch ceiling.
0,The marble shimmered with veins of red copper from the light filtering in through the crystal windows.
0,"The palace’s east garden was in full view, blooming with winter flowers and full trees that never minded the mild winter climate."
0,The palace surrounding the garden was grand.
0,"Only now that she left her room did she realize that her room was far smaller than what she thought the heir to the empire should have, but she did not have the leisure to dwell on that thought."
0,The rising smoke was far more visible here than from her single window looking into the back corner of the garden.
0,"Eydis had thought, or at least hoped, that the smoke was only isolated to what little sky she could see from her window, but black smoke billowed from every direction she could see as she ran down the windowed corridor."
0,The humans had not breached a single location along the city’s wall.
0,They were already throughout the city.
0,“Was there no advanced warning?” Eydis asked.
0,“What of the villages they had to attack along the way?
0,The outposts throughout the land?
0,"Has this battle been raging for so long, and no one thought to inform me?!”"
0,Eydis was livid.
0,"As heir to the Amelian throne, she should have been one of the first to be informed, and yet her caretakers failed to inform her until the enemy was already in the city."
0,How could they be so incompetent?
0,"“The invasion began today, just now,” Afen said as he pushed open the heavy wooden doors at the end of the corridor."
1,The doors opened to a grand hall with arched columns supporting the high ceiling.
0,Large yellow and blue banners with gold trim hung down the columns to the pristine white-marble floors.
0,"In the center, an insignia of ears of wheat arrayed in arborescence glimmered with gold."
0,Eydis realized only now that she had never known the insignia of the Amelian Empire.
0,"Soldiers, palace guards, and servants rushed about in preparation to defend the palace."
0,“Your Highness!” A maid ran over and bowed briefly.
0,"Many of the soldiers, servants, and guards noticed Eydis’s presence and showed a similar surprise."
0,"The palace guards understood something immediately and urged the servants and soldiers to return to their preparations, ordering them to pay Eydis no mind."
0,“Why did you return?
0,"Amel is not safe,” the first maid continued."
0,"“Return?” Eydis repeated, perplexed."
0,"Afen grabbed the aged woman’s shoulder, but before he could push her away, the hall erupted in countless flashes of white light."
0,In the place of every brief flash stood a Tolmyurin soldier in leather or half-chain armor.
0,Flashes of magic and steel filled the grand hall.
0,Eydis quickly erected a barrier to shield the maid from a stone spike and had to turn immediately to erect another to protect Afen’s back from an arrow.
0,The palace guards were the first to recover from the surprise assault and retaliate.
0,The soldiers soon followed.
0,The Tolmyurin invaders scattered in odd patterns as they attacked.
0,"This not only threw off the organization of the hall’s counteroffensive, but it also cleared the precise locations the soldiers had first appeared."
0,"Not a minute later, Eydis understood why."
0,"Another eruption of quick flashes followed, and the number of Tolmyurin soldiers in the hall doubled, now outnumbering the defenders of the hall."
0,There was no way to defend against it.
0,"This was only the east hall of the palace, one of the smaller."
0,"If so many invaders had come here, there had to be countless more throughout the palace."
0,Eydis now understood how the city could so suddenly be under attack from within.
0,"She was never taught the teleportation school of spatial magic, but something told her that such an invasion utilizing teleportation to this degree should be impossible, or else the entire world would be in chaos as all nations feared spatial magic."
0,What spatial magic master had Tolmyur cultivated to enable such a feat?
0,Eydis immediately searched for an escape route to save the noncombatants from being slaughtered in the battle.
0,The doorway back to the windowed corridor was the nearest route.
0,She conjured a wind spear in each hand and flung them at the two enemy soldiers between her and the exit.
0,Her attacks hit the unaware targets.
0,Two palace guards and three soldiers followed up immediately to secure the exit.
0,“Go!” Eydis ordered the maid she continued protecting.
0,"“Your Highness must flee first,” the maid protested."
0,“Find a Namie and escape before it’s too late.”
0,Eydis erected another barrier to block an explosion of fire that quickly enveloped her and the maid before dispersing.
0,Afen was without her barrier and crumbled to the ground in a burning heap.
0,"“No, I will not abandon my people,” Eydis said, mourning in her heart for the guard of her chambers she had known her entire life."
0,What ruler would flee in the height of her nation’s greatest crisis?
0,“Find any servants you can and flee the palace or board yourself inside a room.”
0,“But your Highness—”
0,“GO!” Eydis screamed at the maid.
0,The maid looked into Eydis’s eyes and grew terrified.
0,She no longer questioned the order and followed the few servants who made it to the protection of the soldiers guarding the exit to the corridor.
0,"The Tolmyurin soldiers shifted positions in near unison, once again clearing the precise locations where they had arrived."
0,"Having seen it twice already, Eydis and a small number of the palace guards who were not otherwise occupied readied attacks."
0,"The moment the flashes appeared, Eydis released two wind spears with an outward swing of both her arms."
0,"The first struck the arriving target, but the second flew over her other target’s head."
0,"The middle-aged man was far shorter than most humans, a minum."
0,"He turned and noticed Eydis, staring into her eyes with a sudden realization."
0,Eydis knew she had been recognized as the First Princess of the Amelian Empire.
0,"This man, a commander by the insignia on his leather breastplate, knew her description."
0,Eydis glanced around her and saw that most of the palace guards and soldiers were now being felled by superior numbers.
0,Her barriers alone had enabled her to survive for so long.
0,The hall was lost.
0,"The moment she was about to flee to find a better location for defense or to rally with any other soldiers or guards she might find, an inverted geyser hit her from above and flattened her into the marble floor."
0,"The commander stamped his foot forward, and the marble beneath her crumbled into powder."
0,The geyser pressed her into the thick marble mud.
0,"Eydis grew terrified deep in the mud unable to see or breathe, but she soon realized that she had the strength to resist the geyser’s force."
0,It was not as strong as she thought.
0,"Eydis pushed her head up out of the mud, but the moment she met eyes with the commander from beneath his geyser’s torrent, the geyser vanished and all the water within the mud with it."
0,The commander pressed his hands into the ground.
0,Eydis felt all the marble around her constrict to crush her.
0,"Her voice cried out, and she felt as if her head would burst from the pressure."
0,"There he left her unable to move or speak, her body in terrible pain and her head pounding."
0,Eydis could only watch as the remaining defenders of the hall fell one after the next.
0,She listened until the battles throughout the palace slowly ceased.
0,"In a manner of two or three hours, the palace grew silent."
0,"Once again, only the faint screams of the city reached Eydis’s ears."
0,Amel had lost.
0,"In less than a single day, the palace fell, and no doubt the city would soon follow."
1,"* * *
Eydis slowly grew accustomed to the immense pressure of the marble floor crushing her as she waited under the watchful guard of the commander who had imprisoned her and the invaders that remained in the hall."
0,"The hall grew dark, and the torches and braziers were lit."
0,"All the while, Eydis had no other choice but to listen to the banter of the soldiers praising their Commanding General and their swift victory."
0,Some discussed and questioned her identity as the First Princess of the Amelian Empire.
0,She bore the insults and perverse conversations of those who wanted to have their way with her.
0,Eydis feared what her fate would be.
0,“Commanding General present!” one of the soldiers called.
0,All Tolmyur soldiers stood at attention.
0,An unarmored man in a simple brown robe tied with a thin black sash walked into the hall.
0,The commander who imprisoned Eydis was the first to greet him.
0,"“Commanding General Jethro, I have a gift.” He lowered his hand to Eydis whose head and only part of her right shoulder stuck out of the marble cement."
0,"“Well done, Captain Byurk,” Jethro praised."
0,“The entombment should have killed her.
0,I am positive that she is a—”
0,Jethro raised his hand to silence the captain.
0,He knelt in front of Eydis and brushed the hair from in front of her eyes.
0,“What is your name?”
0,Eydis glared at him.
0,She took the deepest breath she could manage in her constricting prison.
0,“I will not trade words with the man who assaulted my city.” Her voice was little more than a rasp.
0,"“Amel is mine now,” Jethro replied with a cheerful smile."
0,“I cannot say that it has anymore use for its… princess.” 
0,"“Then kill me, butcher, and be done.”"
0,"Eydis wrenched her neck, and the marble at her back cracked."
0,"The soldiers guarding her brandished their spears, pointing them at her."
0,Jethro raised his hand for his men to stand down.
0,“She can do nothing against you with me here.
0,"Now,” he continued, returning his attention to Eydis, “killing you would be a terrible waste."
0,You are quite useful to me alive.
0,"How about a deal, a trade?"
0,"If you become my prisoner, I will not raze your city."
0,Do not worry.
0,I am quite kind to those who cooperate with me.”
0,There was no deception in his words.
0,He spoke the complete truth.
0,Eydis’s only choice was to accept.
0,"If she could spare her people, she did not care what else Tolmyur would do to her."
0,That was her duty as princess.
0,"Chapter 3
“Watch that first step.”
Kimmel"
1,Kimmel stood on a chair in front of his stone-polished darkwood desk.
0,"The room was dim out of habit due to the rationing of fuel in the Tolmyur kingdom, although the freshly conquered Amelian palace in which he currently resided had no need for any rationing."
0,"The dim light was hardly sufficient to accomplish any sort of work, but he preferred the nights to be dim, having grown up in the far less affluent deserts of Tolmyur."
0,"Despite being born a nobleman’s son, he was often forced to work in the dark while his eldest brothers were provided fuel for lighting at night, so Kimmel was accustomed to such conditions."
0,A bright night simply felt… unnatural.
0,"Bending over the desk and supporting his body with his forearm, he finished writing his report on a perfectly executed assassination of the three grandmatriarchs of the dryads, the hamadryads, and started a new report on the capture of two other dryads."
0,"The Tolmyur Kingdom kept detailed records in massive archives, and Kimmel wanted this success to be beautifully told, not to solidify his place in history but to add to the many achievements glorifying his Commanding General, Jethro."
0,The dryad forests of Dhuillir were a vassal territory of the elven-ruled empire.
0,"Dryads specialized in life magic and guerrilla warfare, a troubling combination."
0,"The unified dryad clans under the hamadryads were a terrifying power, and by eliminating the core of that unity, Dhuillir should crumble into its sixteen individual tribes."
0,Kimmel was proud to have taken part in such a vital mission.
0,"Including his success, over 500 political and military officials had been assassinated last night."
0,Only six attempts ended in failure.
0,"The grandest of the assassinations was performed by Commanding General Jethro, who personally volunteered to eliminate the Amelian Empire’s royal family."
0,"The emperor, his three wives, and two of his children were successfully eliminated."
0,"A mighty feat, indeed, as expected of the Commanding General, and a long-held dream of anyone who lived in Tolmyur."
0,Kimmel was giddy just thinking about it.
0,"Regrettably, the tyrant princess was among the failed attempts."
0,Her death was what all of Tolmyur hoped for the most.
0,"They received word that the emperor had taken a fourth wife, but no one outside the palace knew who she was, so she never became a target."
0,"By the time they learned of her existence, she had already escaped."
0,The Commanding General accepted full responsibility for his failures and never passed blame to someone else as any other lesser general likely would have.
0,His humility was inspirational.
0,"The hamadryads that Kimmel was ordered to assassinate, on the other hand, could not escape."
0,"They were a rare form of dryad that lived long enough to take root in the ground and grow like trees, so they never moved."
0,"Dryads had a cultural or religious custom that once one aged enough to take root, they pilgrimage to introduce themselves to the sixteen dryad tribes and end the pilgrimage in some sacred grove."
0,This meant all the hamadryads were in one place.
0,How fortunate.
0,"There was no limit to the number of hamadryads and so no limit to the number of grandmatriarchs, but the probability for a dryad to live long enough to become a hamadryad without succumbing to rot, disease, or any other ailment common to aged plants was extremely low."
0,"Such ailments should be simple to heal since dryads were some of the strongest of life mages, but they treated age and death as sacred, so they never interfered with that natural process, at least among their own kind."
0,Luck was the only factor that determined if a dryad would live long enough to become a hamadryad.
0,"Essentially, Kimmel only had to locate the three luckiest of dryads who were rooted in place in a single location and make use of his fire magic to burn them all to the ground."
0,"He could still hear the screams, and what a joyous sound they were."
0,Even greater than the hamadryads’ screams were the wails of the dryads who could only watch as the ageless living monuments of dryad unity burned to ashes.
0,Kimmel could only laugh.
0,The task was almost too easy.
0,A special use of fire magic taught to him personally by his Commanding General enabled him to move unseen in a cloak of thermal ven.
0,"Combined with his own self-developed specialization that could set a fire inside the hamadryad from a distance, he never needed to produce an external flame that would give away his position or touch the hamadryad, which would place him at risk to some of the strongest life magic on Whinhlem."
0,"Any other fire mage his Commanding General could have sent may have been able to complete the mission, but they would have undoubtedly died in the immediate retaliation."
0,"Kimmel was never caught, let alone seen."
0,He took great pride in his abilities and knew his Commanding General did as well.
0,He was one of only a few who received personal tutelage.
0,How could he not be special?
0,"Once he eliminated the grandmatriarchs, he expected to be involved in the invasion of Amel the next morning, but he found a piece of parchment at the planned retrieval point that detailed a second mission."
0,"The Commanding General needed two dryads, one shaman and the other a sister or daughter of the shaman, someone emotionally close."
0,Kimmel was charged with capturing both.
0,He did not understand the reason for the additional order until the Commanding General himself arrived after the successful conquering of the Amelian Empire’s capital city--another miraculous feat--and personally teleported both Kimmel and the two captured dryads back to the palace.
0,The Commanding General had a lead on finding the location of the escaped princess but needed a highly adept life mage to extract a teleportation trace from a seemingly dead half-elf.
0,The Commanding General’s knowledge of magic far surpassed anything Kimmel or the Tolmyur Kingdom had ever known.
0,"The ability to extract the spell trace from the body of the caster was only one of many examples, the ability to teleport an entire invading army into a city being another."
0,"His Commanding General was exceptionally talented in magic for a sotnum, a human."
0,The only problem with obtaining the trace was that such extraction took a level of life magic that surpassed the abilities of the captured High Elves in the palace.
0,They needed a dryad.
0,Dryads were troublesome negotiation partners.
0,They were difficult to threaten because their long lives often made them shrewd.
0,"Despite their race being completely female, concepts like sexual assault were foreign to most due to reproduction being caused by the pollen of other plants in the air, not intercourse."
0,Physical torture was just as pointless.
0,Dryads only resembled elves in appearance but were nearer of kin to plants.
0,"Damage from weathering, force, or other physical causes were no reason for concern to dryads due to their few pain receptors and ability to rapidly repair or even regrow any lost or damaged part of their body."
0,The only exception to their regenerative abilities was fire.
0,Fire damage could not be healed.
0,"The life sap that ran through their body in place of blood was flammable, not as much as oil or alcohol but enough to make every dryad fear an open flame, making it the only threat that could be used against a dryad besides a premature death."
0,"But if their dryad guest was willing, there would be no need to resort to such measures."
0,The Commanding General was well-known in Tolmyur for his kindness and hospitality to those who helped him.
0,"Ever generous, and Kimmel was saved by that generosity once."
0,"Even now, the Commanding General was currently making his dryad guest feel welcome and explaining that he would set them free if the Shaman performed one task."
0,Whether or not that promise would be kept depended on how cooperative she was from the start.
0,Generous and ruthless.
0,Kimmel loved even more how ruthless his Commanding General could be.
0,Kimmel’s report to the king on the captured dryads ended abruptly with a tiny flash of light like a white spark.
0,A small piece of parchment appeared in front of him.
0,It was an order for Kimmel to join the Commanding General.
0,Negotiations had failed.
0,Kimmel jumped off his chair.
0,"This was an expected and exciting development, but he took a quick breath to calm himself."
0,"If he was too excited, he would not be able to perform his role as ordered."
0,The two dryads would have known about the death of the three Grandmatriarchs.
0,"Fire was hard to hide once it spread after all, and now his fire would be of use again, or more specifically his ability to manipulate heat."
0,He reached up to grab the door handle and kicked off the wall to open the heavy wooden door.
0,"If negotiations were successful and the trace was obtained, Kimmel wanted to request his quarters be changed to one better sized for minums, perhaps a room meant for fairy dignitaries."
0,His Commanding General would surely be willing.
1,Kimmel walked down the cold marble hall and up a short flight of steps to a small room with no more than a table and counters lining the wall on one side.
0,It served as a small prep kitchen for the meeting room beside it.
0,"Two soldiers stood in the narrow space, each holding an arm of one young dryad woman."
0,Their hands were gloved to prevent any potential harm from life magic.
0,"The dryad had the appearance of an adult elven woman of three to four years in age, or if he compared her to the shorter-lived human races, perhaps a woman of a year and a half to two years."
0,"The green-brown hue of her perfectly proportioned body combined with her green eyes and long, grass-like hair with plentiful white, long-petalled flowers gave her a bizarre, sylvan beauty."
0,She glared back at Kimmel with open animosity.
0,Kimmel smiled.
0,"If circumstances were different, he would have preferred to have some fun with her first."
0,Breaking that rebellious glint in her eyes would bring him no shortage of entertainment.
0,"After all, torture was his life’s calling and the only reason he avoided beheading or rotting in a jail cell somewhere in Tolmyur after his plans to usurp the kingdom was leaked by his sister to his Commanding General."
0,The soldiers pulled the dryad after Kimmel and released her in front of the meeting room.
1,Kimmel opened the door.
0,The dryad gasped in relief seeing her mother unharmed and sitting on a red leather chair across from another man.
0,The seemingly dead half-elf on the low table between them did not draw her attention.
0,"The shaman was just as happy to see her daughter safe, but her expression quickly changed to dread."
0,She knew what this was.
0,"The dread spread to the dryad beside Kimmel, but before she could react, her neck was constricted by an invisible force that prevented her from screaming."
0,Her feet were then restrained by a similar invisible force and rose.
0,"The dryad lost her balance in the air and fell back, but her feet did not follow, locked upright by the barrier."
0,"Her ankles broke in an audible crack from the dryad’s weight, and she hung upside down."
0,The Commanding General raised his hand and directed the woman to the back of the room against the wall next to an unlit fireplace.
0,"Kimmel followed the levitating body, amazed as always at his Commanding General’s manipulation of barriers to do things he had never seen."
0,"The girl lowered enough that her shoulders were level with Kimmel’s, and her long, grass-like hair slid along the ground."
0,“L-leave her alone.
0,We want nothing to do with this war!” the Shaman pleaded.
0,"The dryad beside Kimmel glared at the Commanding General, but there was fear in the shaman’s eyes."
0,Kimmel now understood why his Commanding General chose to negotiate with the mother instead of the daughter.
0,"“You are a member of the Amelian Empire, are you not?"
0,And you have been wholly uncooperative.” The Commanding General’s face showed neither frustration nor anger.
0,“And… and I can’t do what you want of me.
0,I have never heard of such magic!”
0,“Take the hair.”
0,Kimmel removed a small wolfram knife and cut the dryad’s long hair just short of where the flowers bloomed.
0,"Dryad hair regrew quickly, but the trauma of being cut prevented it from blooming for about a year."
0,The flowers that bloom collected pollen.
0,"In other words, dryad hair was directly tied to reproduction, and cutting it was one of the greatest forms of humiliation."
0,The dryad did not mourn the loss of her hair.
0,What was one year to a race that could outlive even the elves?
0,"She did, however, understand her position as the target her captors could openly harm to force her mother into submission."
0,"Her eyes burned with indignation, but the Commanding General’s expression did not change."
0,"“Even if you could find a spell trace from a dead man, what would you do with it?” the shaman asked."
0,“What concern is it to you?” The Commanding General leaned back in his identical red leather chair and rested his hands behind his disheveled head.
0,“Is it because we are at war with the Amelian Empire?
0,I thought you had no connection with it?”
0,The shaman bit her lip.
0,"“But if you must know, I can tell you."
0,"I already mentioned that I was curious about the spell being something that I did not think anyone of this world capable of performing, but that was only part of the truth."
0,The spell was a special form of teleportation.”
0,"“If you tell her too much, she is going to catch on to what that means,” Kimmel said while tossing the cut hair into the cold fireplace."
0,Kimmel’s words were not meant to undermine his Commanding General’s negotiations.
0,They were a prearranged act calculated to make the dryad shaman think about why they would want a teleportation trace.
0,Both Kimmel and his Commanding General wanted her to discover their aims.
0,"As expected, the dryad shaman was not so foolish that she would miss their meaning."
0,"Because Kimmel captured the two dryads near the grandmatriarch’s grove, she knew about the assassination of the hamadryads."
0,The grandmatriarchs would be lesser assassination targets.
0,"Without a doubt there would have been more, and these men wanted to find one who got away."
0,“Who?
0,Who are you after?”
0,"“I want to get information on a spell for my own curiosity,” the Commanding General replied with a pleased smile that accentuated his deep dimples."
0,“Will you help?”
0,The shaman remained silent.
0,She was weighing the risk of helping against the lives of her and her daughter.
0,"If the target was one of grave importance, their sacrifice for the protection of the Amelian Empire would be the wisest decision."
0,"But, Tolmyur had already conquered the capital city and palace, so what other high-profile targets could there be?"
0,"If the target was smaller, even on the level of her own grandmatriarchs, a mother could find reason to choose the safety of her daughter over another who would mean no more to the safety of the empire than a government official who could be replaced, especially since the target was most likely not a dryad."
0,"However, telling her that it was someone of lesser importance would sound like an obvious deflection and further make her believe it was a target of grave importance, causing her to refuse outright."
0,"Besides, his Commanding General was always honest."
0,He would never lie even if it was advantageous to do so.
0,The key was that the shaman could not know and had to keep guessing.
0,"For now, further persuasion was needed."
0,"With a nod from his Commanding General, Kimmel began channeling heat into the knife in his hand."
0,Wolfram had an incredibly high melting point.
0,"Unlike iron, it could withstand and retain heat that even the best fire mages would have difficulty protecting themselves against."
0,"Kimmel agitated the fire ven in his hand to move at faster and faster speeds, and the knife began to glow with such intense white heat that smoke rose from his sleeves."
0,“Please!
0,Stop!” 
0,The shaman stretched her hand out and tried to leave her chair but was bound in place by another of the Commanding General’s barriers.
0,"The suspended dryad looked at the knife with wide eyes, unable to cry out in fear due to the barrier restricting her voice."
0,Kimmel plunged the knife into the dryad’s arm just past her shoulder and cut down.
0,"Despite appearing and feeling no different than skin, the dryad’s flesh burned like wood."
0,Fascinating.
0,Orange embers grew on the edges of the knife’s path and fractured inward as they followed the veins of flammable life sap.
0,The woman writhed in silent agony far surpassing what even a dryad pain tolerance could withstand.
0,"Kimmel finished the downward cut and continued upward, slowly this time to watch the peculiar way the knife burned the wood-flesh as he fully severed the arm."
0,"Any human would have passed out or died from the trauma alone, but the dryad remained conscious."
0,"Her hair would grow back, but the burnt stub of her shoulder could never regrow her arm."
0,Kimmel grew an overeager smile and aimed at the next arm.
0,“Stop!
0,"Stop!” The shaman pleaded for her daughter with tearful eyes, but her daughter looked back with a pained expression that begged her not to give in."
0,“I’ll do it!
0,I’ll do it…”
0,“Good to hear.”
0,The Commanding General’s teeth peeked from between his grinning lips.
0,He waved his hand at Kimmel who slowed down the agitated fire ven in his hand to cool the knife and placed his hand above the dryad’s shoulder to chill the embers slowly eating away at her from the inside.
0,"The rebellion in her eyes was gone, replaced by sobs of defeat."
0,Kimmel felt a rise in his chest that broke into a pleased smile across his face.
0,"This was not how he wanted to break her, but he was enjoying it all the same."
0,"Seeing the knife dim to a blackened coating of scale and soot, the mother of the tortured woman cried in relief."
1,The Commanding General began his explanation to the dryad shaman with an odd interpretation of ven theory.
0,"Ven was not a fuel for magic, like wood that would burn to create fire, as Kimmel had always imagined."
0,It was more like the breath you inhale to speak a command or parchment you would write the command upon.
0,One’s affinity determined their authority over the elements--whether the elements would obey the command given--and ven transmitted that command.
0,"When a spell was cast, an imprint was left in the parchment that could be read, or an echo of what was spoken that could be heard, which the dryad shaman understood better being from an oral culture rather than literate."
0,"The grander the spell, the grander the command, and so the harder the imprint in the parchment would be to obfuscate."
0,Or the louder the echo.
0,It was only now that Kimmel realized his Commanding General was providing dual analogies so that he too could learn from the explanation.
0,This remnant of the command was the resident trace Commanding General Jethro desired.
0,"Once the shaman understood the target, Jethro began explaining the procedure in excruciating detail, something about biological connections in the mind that determined thought and how this imprint or echo remained on them."
0,"The complexity was so far beyond Kimmel’s understanding, but the shaman, a life mage who best understood the intricacies of biology, followed without issue or even question."
0,"Clearly, Kimmel’s lesson had ended, but he had to wonder, where did all his Commanding General’s knowledge come from?"
0,All of this was unheard of.
0,"If a magic scholar published such findings, he would be numbered among the greatest magicians in history, yet his Commanding General kept this knowledge and more hidden and only revealed it as needed."
0,"Once the explanation finished, the Commanding General gave the dryad shaman freedom of motion."
0,"“Can you do it?” he asked, more as an ultimatum than for confirmation."
0,"“It will be difficult, but I think it is possible with how you explained it.”"
0,"“Remember, I do not just need his ven but the remnants of the command lingering on the ven."
0,And please be careful.
0,"I will be casting the spell once you give me the trace, and if it is not what I saw before, well, I do not think I need to say, do I?”"
0,“Understood…” The shaman placed her hand on the half-elf’s forehead.
0,"Small, white root-fibers grew from her hand and penetrated the skin of the half-elf."
1,She knelt with eyes closed in concentration long enough to bore Kimmel who decided to lean against the fireplace and examine the odd contrast of the wood-like embers on the severed human-like arm.
0,"The skin of the arm felt no different than the skin of any other target Kimmel had entertained himself with in the past, but the charred stub did not resemble burnt flesh."
0,The cracks and white ash from the embers looked no different than a stick that had been pulled from a fire.
0,It even smelled of wood smoke.
0,He soon grew bored of this too and returned to the hanging dryad.
0,He wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes with her own hand and caressed her cheek as if comforting her in her sorrow.
0,"All the while, he did not notice Jethro eying him from behind in disappointment."
0,Kimmel felt another rise.
0,The rebellious glint in the dryad’s eyes returned in a furious glare.
0,"He so desperately wanted to break her, permanently."
0,She had that special kind of stubbornness that he loved.
0,His father and eight older brothers were the same.
0,Killing them slowly was the greatest joy of his childhood.
0,"With enough pain, people will agree to anything, even giving up succession rights or promising to be blind to the other siblings he’d killed."
0,"This was most effective when the injuries were not visible, so there would be no evidence."
0,"For fire magic, there was only one option: no surface burns."
0,The trick then was that too strong of an internal flame would kill them too quickly.
0,"Precision and control were key, and his control, practiced to perfection, was the reason his Commanding General took interest in him."
0,His Commanding General would always caution him that tempering his mind and emotions was just as important as tempering his flame.
0,This proved to be the greatest advice.
0,"It made people less cautious of him, which created even more brilliant reactions when he revealed his true self to the people he’d hunt for practice."
0,"When his Commanding General ordered him to stop targeting those who had done no harm, Kimmel instead hunted people who were willing to commit crimes."
0,What powerful insight!
0,Those were just the type of people who were harder to break and so provided even better practice.
0,His Commanding General’s wisdom was incomparable to anyone else on Whinhlem.
1,"The shaman requested the Commanding General to extend his hand, pulling Kimmel from his reflections."
0,Kimmel thought he should warn her not to harm him because life magic worked by touch--she could easily poison him or do other harm--but in the end decided against it.
0,"Any damage done would mean death for her, her daughter, and likely her people."
0,"The Commanding General was also the only person who would be able to understand the trace, so he had no choice but to receive it personally."
0,Sending the trace took far less time than reading it.
0,The shaman let go of the Commanding General’s hand and was ordered to sit back in her chair.
0,"Kimmel watched in anticipation of this never-before-seen teleportation that his Commanding General seemed to be more excited about than even finding the tyrant princess, although the two were directly connected."
0,The Commanding General cast the spell by tearing open the space beside him.
0,"Unlike other teleportation spells, the destination was not visible on the other side of the portal."
0,There was only darkness.
0,"Even if the location was protected by a teleportation barrier, the location would simply be blurred or clouded over."
0,Kimmel wondered if the teleportation failed.
0,"That same worry showed on the face of the dryad shaman who nervously began pleading to the Commanding General that she did everything she could, but he demanded her silence."
0,“This is it.
0,"It has been so long since… I suppose I did see it yesterday as well, but still."
0,This is perfect!
0,"Kimmel, come here.”"
0,Kimmel tossed the arm into the fireplace and stood beside his Commanding General.
0,"“I would like you to go through, assess the location quickly, and then immediately return.”"
0,The portal was nothing more than an abyss that stretched out into infinite darkness.
0,The light of the room did not penetrate it.
0,It appeared to have infinite depth but at the same time no depth as if it had been painted in the air in front of him.
0,"He would never admit it vocally, but it scared him."
0,"However, orders were absolute."
0,He walked to the strange abyss and touched it.
0,There was a little resistance but no pain.
0,"Taking a deep breath, he stepped through the strange membrane."
1,The bizarre blackness wrapped around him and pulled him through with the sensation of being dragged upstream through a viscous fluid.
0,"Kimmel found himself on a deserted, peculiar, black paved road on the slope of a stony hill at the foot of some snow-dusted mountains."
0,Vegetation was scarce.
0,"The air was frigid and bitter and hard to breathe, and his body felt as if it might float up into the sky if he jumped."
0,In the distance down the mountain was a monumental city of impossible design.
0,Unbelievably tall structures that sparkled with light rose from the center on the far side of a bisecting river.
0,He could not begin to think how they remained standing without wide and expanding supports at the base.
0,They were just as thin at the bottom as they were at the top.
0,"Red and white lights moved uniformly along what may be roads, but in the dark, he could not make sense of any of it."
0,"It was as if some master had grasped the stars, arranged them in lines and boxes, and then sent them flowing like water along their paths."
0,The land was like a strange dream that Kimmel doubted his mind could ever conjure.
0,"The city was within walking distance, but Kimmel did not have the luxury to investigate."
0,He had to return.
1,"“Was it like another world, different from this one,” his Commanding General asked once Kimmel returned and the portal was closed."
0,"The world Kimmel lived in was vast, and there was little way that anyone could ever fully explore it on one’s own, but everything about the strange location on the other side of the portal told Kimmel that it was different."
0,"“Yes, sir."
0,I cannot imagine that place being somewhere we could find through travel alone.
0,Another world is the only way I could describe it.”
0,“It was a success?” 
0,The shaman let out a sigh of relief.
0,The Commanding General closed the portal and sat back down in his seat.
0,"Kimmel also moved next to the wroth, hanging dryad."
0,“I would like to thank you for your cooperation.
0,"But, I do have some concerns."
0,"You called this elf a dead man, and I am sure you assumed I would know a body’s ven disperses when someone dies."
0,"Being such a powerful life mage as you are, you would know he is very much alive, even without touching him."
0,I can only assume that you asserted he was dead to prevent me from retrieving the trace.
0,Why would that be?”
0,“I promise you that was not my intent!
0,I only thought your request impossible to grant and was begging for your reason.”
0,"“So I am unreasonable, then?"
0,I tend to find myself very reasonable if someone agrees to cooperate from the start.
0,I would have even rewarded you for your efforts.
0,"Regrettably, you fought me all the way."
0,You realized that we are trying to chase down a failed assassination target.
0,Am I correct?”
0,"“No, I was not thinking that!” "
0,Tears streamed down the shaman’s cheeks.
0,"With a nod from his Commanding General, Kimmel reached up and placed his hand near the stomach of the hanging dryad."
0,Ven converted to fire but not on the surface of his hand.
0,"To the onlooking shaman, Kimmel’s actions appeared like a threat, but it was the final order of a failed negotiation."
0,“Yes!
0,Yes!
0,"I realized that was your aim, but I still helped you, didn’t I?"
0,I did what you asked!” The shaman pleaded even more earnestly for the life of her daughter.
0,"“You did, and you far outperformed my expectations."
0,"However, I applied a barrier to block out any converted ven and to only accept the raw ven from the trace."
0,"When you touched me, my barrier felt some resistance."
0,What were you trying to do?”
0,"That was why he was given the final order, Kimmel realized."
0,"The dryad shaman’s face grew dry with fear, forming faint wrinkles and chapping her lips."
0,“Nothing.
0,I was only sending you the trace.
0,Dryads can only use life magic.
0,You have to expect some excess life ven to be mixed in.” 
0,"“Knowing my expertise in magic, do you think I am foolish enough to believe that?"
0,Raw ven remains raw until you willingly convert it.
0,There would have been nothing but raw ven from the trace if that is all you desired it to be.
0,I can only assume you meant me harm.”
0,The hanging dryad screamed.
0,The barrier that restricted her voice had been removed.
0,Kimmel leaned against the fireplace away from the woman.
0,"Glowing orange cracks appeared in the dryad’s stomach extending outward, and flames grew from the cracks as the life sap fueled their growth like burning veins."
0,The shaman watched in horror as the fires spread and engulfed her daughter from the inside out.
0,The woman’s stomach became a hollow cage of embers.
0,"Before the fire grew too large, Kimmel grabbed the flaming body and dragged it into the fireplace."
0,"The shaman looked back at the Commanding General, unable to form any words of anger, hatred, or spite."
0,The Commanding General’s expression never changed.
0,It remained the same pleased smile.
0,"“As a bonus, I thought you should know that you have committed the ultimate act of treason against the Amelian Empire."
0,"The target you just gave me the location of is none other than the heir of the royal family, the First Princess, now Empress, Eydis FeAmel.”"
0,"The figure across from the Commanding General sat lifeless in her chair, her mind now broken from the realization that she had not only lost her daughter but also caused the end of the Amel Dynasty."
0,Kimmel was in awe.
0,"Breaking people was his hobby and profession, but he felt inferior to Commanding General Jethro."
0,"He was confident that he could have broken a dryad in a day or two, but his Commanding General accomplished the same in the span of a single negotiation."
0,Kimmel only acted as an assistant playing his part as instructed.
0,This man was a god in Kimmel’s eyes.
0,"“In that state I do not think she will be a problem any longer, but we cannot return her with knowledge of resident traces or trans-world teleportation,” his Commanding General said."
0,Kimmel grabbed the dryad shaman by the leg and pulled her off the chair.
0,"Without any resistance or movement on her part, he rolled her into the now roaring fireplace."
0,"“It seems dryads are just wood after all,” Kimmel jested."
0,“Weren’t you telling the truth when you said you would reward her?”
0,"“Of course, if she agreed without me needing to summon you."
0,"While I would not have allowed her to return with the knowledge I gave her, I would have sent her daughter home if that was her choice."
0,I was prepared to give her the whole of the palace’s royal gardens as her personal grove.
0,I doubt she would find such a stunning array of flora anywhere in Dhuillir.”
0,“I’m glad she didn’t agree.
0,It would have been boring for me otherwise.
0,What should we do about the half-elf?” Kimmel asked.
0,“I will keep him alive.
0,This portal that he designed is far more stable than… than what I expected.
0,He is quite the competent spatial mage.
0,"Although I hate to admit it, if he had the knowledge of spatial magic that I possess, I do not feel that I could have defeated him in combat."
0,There is no doubt in my mind that I would have died the moment he appeared to rescue the princess.”
0,"“All the more reason to kill him,” Kimmel spat."
0,There was no way any elf could be his Commanding General’s equal.
0,“No.
0,There may be more that I could learn from him.
0,I will have the life mages ensure he makes a full recovery but stays sedated.
0,We will keep him in prison for the time being.
0,"But first, I would like to send you after the princess.”"
0,“Me?” Kimmel was genuinely surprised that the Commanding General would trust him with such an important mission.
0,He was even more excited to be able to search the mystical city up close.
0,“I am honored.
0,When do I depart?”
0,His Commanding General called in a guard who carried a bag of provisions and Kimmel’s equipment.
0,Kimmel’s participation had been planned from the start.
0,"Once Kimmel was prepared and after confirming that the location the portal had opened was safe and where few would notice, his Commanding General gave final instructions."
0,"“Your mission is to scout out the land, and if possible, find the princess."
0,You are one of the few fire mages I taught who has been able to master the use of thermal energy and light to conceal your presence.
0,"Use that to stay hidden, and do not engage her unless you are sure you can kill or capture her cleanly without resistance."
0,I will open the portal once more three days from this time.
0,Report to me then.”
0,His Commanding General tore open the black portal.
0,Kimmel peered into the abyss.
0,He jumped through and the portal quickly vanished behind him.
0,Jethro sat back in his leather chair and rubbed his temples with his thumb and forefinger.
0,"He had invested far too much effort into Kimmel to not make use of him, but the truth remained that Kimmel was a danger."
0,"Such genius in magical control was an exceptional find, but at what point was a personality so twisted that no amount of genius could compensate?"
0,Jethro had tried to fix Kimmel.
0,"He had tried for so long, but everything he taught was misunderstood and twisted and only made Kimmel worse."
0,"Jethro had two other covert specialists he had personally trained, fire mages like Kimmel with enough control to bend light to conceal themselves, but for the first mission to an unknown world with untested inhabitants, Kimmel was the only one of the three he felt comfortable testing the unknown risk."
1,"* * *
Kimmel passed through the nauseating portal and landed on the odd, black road."
0,"The loud roar of a horn blared behind him, and before he could turn around, he was struck by a large, fast-moving object."
0,"The long-haul trucker floored his brakes, thinking he had just struck a lost child wandering the road in the dark, but this only ground the minum under the tires, leaving nothing more than a red streak on the pavement."
0,"Chapter 4
“Gestures may not be universal, but goodwill is.”
Eydis"
1,The night of the assassinations.
0,The view of Emer vanished through the black void of the portal.
0,The sensation of a cold membrane enveloped Eydis’s body.
0,It layered pressure on her but at the same time sucked her through.
0,"She was choked by perfect blackness, void of light and life, for what felt like an eternity within her troubled mind."
0,Tears welled in her unseeing eyes.
0,It was unlike any portal she had ever passed through.
0,"Never once had Eydis been involved in an emergency evacuation, so she did not know if these escape portals were all this way."
0,"When she was about to cry, the sensation ended with the impact of Eydis’s back on wet and cold, solid stone ground."
0,"Air erupted from her lungs, and haggard gasps struggled to bring them back to life."
0,"The air above Eydis spun and swirled like a stirred pot, but at least there was faint light."
0,"She blinked her eyes to regain their focus, but the black portal continued to bend and contort."
0,"The tension created cracks, and it began to break."
0,Her eyes worked fine.
0,The distortion she saw was the rift collapsing.
0,"A moment later, it evaporated."
0,Emer did not follow her through this time.
0,“I will stay behind…”
0,Emer’s last words haunted her.
0,"There was no chance that the assassin would spare Emer, especially after helping her escape."
0,"Emer was her tutor, but over the nearly two years she spent learning from him, he had become a dear friend."
0,She wanted to curse him for not following but understood his conviction.
0,"Although a portal could only permit passage for the number of people it was formulated to allow, someone with skill could read the ven trace to determine the destination."
0,"Emer had to stay behind and prevent the assassin, an exceptional spatial mage, from reading it."
0,He fulfilled his sworn role as a Namie and guaranteed her safety.
0,"Her father, her mother, her brothers, her father’s other wives, and now Emer."
0,Eydis lost everyone.
0,They were all taken from her in one night by a single human assassin.
0,"Eydis tried to cry out in anger, frustration, and sorrow, but any sounds that broke through her lips were cut by her lungs crying for air."
0,She could not breathe and was slowly growing lightheaded.
0,"Sitting up and placing her hand on her chest, she channeled life magic to ease the spasming of her diaphragm."
0,"The gasps stopped, and her breathing regulated, but even when inhaling normally, the air she breathed was extremely thin like she was sitting at the summit of a mountain."
0,"The impure air tasted bitter, and a deep breath led to an uncontrollable fit of coughing."
0,"The bitter, cold air and the snow falling from the night sky suggested a volcanic mountain top, but she was sitting between two wide buildings."
0,Did Emer send me to the northern wilderlands?
0,The strange alleyway in which Eydis landed stretched out far to her left and right.
0,"Although it was paved like a road, no one traveled it, and the black paving that resembled a rough matte glaze was unlike anything she had seen before."
0,"The falling snow was wet but fell heavy enough to gather on the road, dampening her skirt and chilling her legs."
0,The odd rectangular structures had many sets of paved stoops with two to three steps leading to doors lining the full width of the alley.
0,"There were no signboards, no markings to tell the purpose of these structures."
0,"At even intervals between each door, large openings in the structures were covered with horizontally ribbed, green metal."
0,"Next to a few of the doors sat large green, blue, or black metal bins."
0,"The wilderlands to the north of the Amelian Empire were mountainous and had frequent snowfall in winter, but the architecture of the plain rectangular structures and the alleyway was far too dissimilar from the typical northern buildings built from stacked layers of thin stones or those repurposed from ruins of an ancient civilization that inhabited the northern continent in ages past."
0,The biting breeze and falling snow sent a chill down Eydis’s back.
0,"Her legs on the ground stung, and her toes were quickly growing numb."
0,She could not yet spare the time to determine where Emer sent her or mourn the loss of her family.
0,"She needed to find help or shelter, preferably both."
0,A lantern lit behind Eydis.
0,She startled and turned to face it but was puzzled by what she saw.
0,There was no visible fire in the lamp.
0,"It did not appear to be fueled by oil or candle, and no one was there to light it."
0,"It only held a strange glowing orb, some form of magical lighting unknown to her."
0,"The door sitting atop three stone steps opened, and a scruffy looking middle-aged man wearing a soiled black apron and strange, dark blue clothing walked out carrying a large black sack that had an oddly reflective sheen."
0,He was human.
0,Eydis stopped breathing.
0,"Fear crawled like insects down her back, and she dared not move."
0,"Her martial training fought her instinct to flee, and in her traumatized mind, flight was slowly winning."
0,The man did not notice her when he turned to toss the sack into a metallic green bin on the side of the door.
0,She began the construction of a teleportation formula in her mind while her heart raced at the sight of a potential enemy.
0,The man produced a small white box and even smaller orange cylinder from his coat pocket.
0,"Removing a thin white stick from the box and placing it in his mouth, he turned his back to the wind and magically produced a tiny flame with the orange cylinder."
0,"His eyes met Eydis’s, and fear overcame her, freezing her in place."
0,"The man called to her in a loud accusatory tone, but she did not understand his words."
0,It was not the human language or any of the over one hundred others she knew.
0,He leaned forward for a better look.
0,"In reaction, Eydis shuffled backward but slipped on the frozen slush and fell to her back."
0,"While scrambling back to a sitting position, Emer’s robe parted to reveal the heavily bruised skin of her chest."
0,The man’s eyes stared at her chest and then found the cut sleeve stained red with Emer’s blood.
0,He eyed the countless bruises on her arms and legs and called out loudly to her once more before descending one step.
0,"Again, Eydis shifted further away from him with a reflexive light yelp in spite of all her past conditioning under Symra."
0,"The man extended his hand, elbow bent, and his palm facing towards her while replacing the small white stick, cylinder, and box in his pocket with his other hand."
0,Magic?
0,Eydis could not tell the nature of the ven the man used.
0,It was skillfully withheld to prevent any sign of what attack might come.
0,All she knew was that this gesture was a sign of aggression.
0,"Eydis made no hostile actions, but this man was threatening her nonetheless."
0,"She now felt her shameful, trauma-fueled fear justified."
0,This was an enemy.
0,"She could attack him first, but she also knew that would give the humans of this land more reason to hunt her."
0,Any movement forward by the man reflexively caused Eydis to recede further back.
0,"Seeing this, the man pulled another small rectangular object from his pocket with his free hand, and after touching it three times with his thumb, he placed it against his ear."
0,He spoke to it without removing his gaze from Eydis or dropping his extended hand.
0,"The tone of the man changed from explanatory, to annoyed, and to calmed, directing words both at something unseen and Eydis."
0,"Even if she could understand his words, Eydis was too scared to respond, fearing this man might be just as powerful as the assassin, however unlikely that may be."
0,"The man placed the object back in his pocket and continued staring at Eydis, never once dropping his hand."
0,Frantic questions sped through Eydis’s mind.
0,Should she run?
0,Should she attack?
0,"If she tried to use teleportation magic, he could strike before she could enter the portal."
0,Should she set a barrier first?
0,"If she did that, he might sense it and have reason to attack or call for help."
0,"She might still be protected then, but if he was as strong as the assassin… But, no sign of magic was appearing on his hand."
0,Was it a bluff?
0,"Many humans could not use magic, or so she was taught."
0,"Then again, that assassin was human."
1,Neither she nor the man made any movements for the longest time as the snow fell enough to coat most of the matte road in grey.
0,The tension of the standoff choked her in the already thin air.
0,The sound of grinding gravel reached Eydis’s ears.
0,"It grew to a low growl, and blue and red light became visible from around the corner of the building."
0,"The man’s face relaxed, but he did not move."
0,Eydis’s fear became terror when a large beast rumbled around the corner.
0,Its voice was an incessant purr that never paused for air.
0,"The dual-colored flare affixed to a bar across the top of its back flashed alternating, piercing blues and reds."
0,Its eyes beamed with blinding yellow light as it appeared to slide towards them along the ground.
0,"Wincing from the light of its eyes, Eydis could not make out the form of the beast."
0,The man who threatened her to keep her from running had summoned something terrifying.
0,I should have risked it.
0,I should have run.
0,The man lowered his hand and faced the beast.
0,"A wing extended from its side, and another human appeared from behind it, or perhaps from within it."
0,Someone had been riding the beast.
0,She could not tell if it was a town guard or knight.
0,"He wore no armor and wielded no visible weapon, but he was wearing dark clothing of much higher quality than the other man, showing some unknown difference in role or status between them."
0,And she could not rule out the possibility of him being a magic expert like the assassin who had no need for physical weaponry.
0,The new arrival looked Eydis in the eyes and then turned to speak with the man.
0,Both their attention was off her.
0,"Taking advantage of the opening, Eydis released pure and uncontrolled wind from her hand into the ground causing the accumulated snow and slush to fly in all directions."
0,Both the humans shielded their faces.
0,"Eydis activated her prepared teleportation formula and entered the portal, closing it behind her."
1,Eydis exited forcefully into a bush.
0,The impact broke small branches while the thicker ones scraped and punctured her arm and side.
0,“Ahh…” Eydis moaned as she rolled off the damaged shrub into snow-dusted leaves.
0,Her teleportation had no predetermined destination.
0,She knew nothing of this land.
0,"Her only choice was to set a requirement for the exit, somewhere with foliage where she could hide."
0,Such a simple teleportation formula would have led to an intense scolding from Emer.
0,He had taught her that a lack of restrictions on a randomized destination portal could spell disaster--a lesson well learned.
0,Eydis whimpered again from the pain of her imperfect teleportation.
0,"She was free from the two humans, but that did not ease her mind."
0,"The portal was gone, but if either of those humans were spatial mages like the assassin, they could still read the lingering trace because no one was there to erase it."
0,That should not be possible in the first place!
0,Eydis screamed in her mind.
0,A human using spatial magic was unheard of.
0,It was a rare affinity that only races with strong innate magical ability could even possess.
0,"And that assassin far surpassed her spatial magic mentor, the court magician, the spatial prodigy, the best spatial mage in the entire Amelian Empire."
0,"Not only her family, but now her entire reasoning left her."
0,This night was one painful absurdity after another.
0,"Eydis curled into a ball, wanting this terrible nightmare to end."
0,She wanted to wake up.
0,She wanted to greet the cheerful smiles of her maids in the morning.
0,She wanted to spend the day laughing and playing with Ceil.
0,"She wanted her life to return to normal, but the strong wind that blew over her chilled her to the bone and emphasized the reality of her situation."
0,Symra’s survival training took over.
0,"Eydis was outside in the snow in a land controlled by humans, and she needed to create shelter before she weakened any further."
0,All Eydis saw near her in the dark were plants.
0,"While most had lost their leaves, there were many that remained lush despite the cold."
0,The sound of running water told her a river was right beside her down the bank.
0,The flowing water only added to the chill in the air.
0,Lights of a city glimmered across the water from the other side of the river.
0,Strangely tall buildings dotted the horizon.
0,"Both up and down river, more lights could be seen."
0,"Behind her, a long wall of lush, thin trees blocked the view of anything past them."
0,"She had found an isolated, lightly forested location just separate from the city across the river."
0,"The surrounding bushes and wall of trees would provide cover, and with the river at her back, there was little chance of anyone seeing her from that direction if she hid among the bushes."
0,"So long as she did not leave here, Eydis felt there was little chance of anyone finding her until the light of daybreak."
0,"Channeling life magic into her hand, she applied it to the small bleeding punctures and scrapes from the bush."
0,"The magic sterilized the wound, sewed the damaged tissue together, and accelerated the healing of her skin."
0,"The repairs were imperfect in such little light, but any visible scars could be remedied in the morning."
0,She ran her hands across the aching welts and bruises all over her body from her desperate defense against the assassin.
0,Life magic repaired the damaged blood vessels and tissue underneath.
0,"The inflammation and swelling decreased, but the blood that caused the discoloration of her skin would have to fade naturally."
0,"It was a painful process, but if the bruising was not treated, her body would be in terrible shape after the next magic she would cast."
0,"Next, she surged life ven through her body to accelerate her metabolic rate and blood flow slightly to increase and better regulate her body temperature."
0,"This method of hypothermia prevention was dangerous over long periods of time due to the increase of her body’s resource consumption and constant drain on her ven, but a single night would not be a problem."
0,Any physical shelter made from the shrubs and trees would be easily spotted.
0,"Until Eydis could better ascertain her situation, she made the decision to forgo a physical shelter."
0,"The effects of the cold could be mitigated this way, but as an extra precaution, Eydis placed a thin, two-restriction barrier around herself."
0,"The first restriction slowed any entering wind to prevent wind chill, and the second regulated the escape of heat."
0,"The fight with the assassin had consumed the majority of her ven, but such a weak barrier and her metabolic regulations should last through the night on her remaining reserves and what ven replenished as she slept."
0,"Eydis cleared the snow beneath her and curled up on the dead leaves, praying that when she wakes, she would be back in her bed in the palace."
1,Eydis woke with a haze in her eyes and her mind muddy.
0,She could not move her arms or legs.
0,She could not even feel if they were there.
0,Dark blue and green blurs shook with every jolt or sway of her body.
0,The sensation was akin to sea-drunkenness.
0,The faint pressure of an arm on her back told her she was being carried.
0,"The riverside plants changed immediately to some structure, and then she was inside."
0,Whoever carried her placed her on a soft bed and ran around frantically gathering items which were placed in her armpits and between her legs.
0,"The touch of the objects was painful, but their radiant heat slowly crept through her body."
0,"The person then disappeared into a hallway to return with a large pile of something that was then layered on top of her, blankets."
0,This person knelt next to Eydis and looked into her clouded eyes.
0,"At this distance, she was able to see the features of his round face."
0,He was a young human man with short blond hair and deep blue eyes like sapphires.
0,The man spoke some words in a soft tone and smiled with his faint pink lips.
0,He then went to the far wall and tapped an object affixed to it.
0,Warm air blew in the room.
0,"Eydis’s clouded mind could not find reason to worry about or be fearful of the human, so she nestled into the warmth of the blankets and let sleep take her again."
1,Deep slumber was interrupted by angry voices.
0,"In her drowsy haze, Eydis saw the man who took her in engaged in a heated argument with a second, taller man near the small wooden table at the far end of the room."
0,"Once her eyes found focus, she saw the taller man grasping a familiar small rectangular object in his hand."
0,Unease rose in her stomach when remembering the terrifying beast that could be summoned by that same object.
0,"As the argument continued, her rescuer seemed to convince the other man to return it to his pocket."
0,"The tall man then pointed at her rescuer, shouted, and departed out the door to the left, slamming it behind him."
0,The man who took her in sat on a wooden chair of similar make to the table and wiped his hands down his face before letting out a frustrated moan.
0,"After sitting for a time, he produced the same small object from his own pocket and proceeded to tap it with his thumb."
0,"Eydis thought he had convinced the taller man, but the opposite was true."
0,"His actions showed his reluctance to summon whatever that monster was, but he must summon it nonetheless, possibly out of duty or obligation."
0,She had to stop him.
0,"Eydis scrambled out from under the many blankets, stumbling in frantic motions, her feet slick with sweat and slipping over the polished wood flooring."
0,"Her martial training told her to strike him down before he raised alarm, but in her heart she couldn’t."
0,"He was human, but she knew he helped her."
0,"Kneeling before her rescuer, she placed one hand atop the object and grasped his pant leg with the other."
0,She bowed her head as far as she could without tugging on his clothing and pleaded in the human language she knew.
0,"“Please, do not."
0,I beseech you…”
0,"Eydis did not know if he understood her words, so she remained in her supplicant posture."
0,The man removed her hand from the object.
0,"Fearing that he would not listen, Eydis placed her hand back on top."
0,“Please!” she pleaded again.
0,This time his hand gently grasped hers.
0,She looked up and saw him place the object back in his pocket.
0,"Relief filled her heart, and she felt as if she would cry."
0,He pulled Eydis to her feet and sat her down on his chair.
0,He then walked over and folded up the damaged robe that was caught under the blankets on the couch.
0,"Placing the robe aside, he grabbed one of the top blankets, and after saying a few words, wrapped it around Eydis’s exposed shoulders."
0,His consideration for her warmth and even the care he showed for Emer’s robe was not what Eydis expected from a human.
0,Humans were supposed to be crass and unruly.
0,They were a barbaric race that had settled the inhospitable deserts on the east side of the continent and would launch unprovoked attacks against the Amelian Empire every decade or so.
0,This man’s consideration was what she expected from the elves or other more civilized races.
0,"Once Eydis was comfortable, the man walked over to the corner of the room that appeared to be for storage or perhaps food preparation."
0,Counter space covered most of the length of the back wall.
0,"Cupboards were mounted on the wall above the counter, and a wash basin sunk into the counter on the left."
0,"A tall white cabinet stood in the far corner on the right from which he removed a few eggs and a wrapped orange block, holding them up for Eydis to see."
0,"He then grabbed a pan and lit a fire atop a strange looking range in the center of the counterspace without magic, oil, or kindling."
0,Who was he?
0,Perhaps he was not human and only appeared as one.
0,Nymphs in the Amelian Empire were nearly identical to humans aside from the nymphs’ vibrant hair colors.
0,There could be other races unknown to Eydis that looked like humans but were not.
0,Eydis ruled out that possibility quickly.
0,"In her education, she had learned about all the peoples of her world."
0,She was taught every race on Whinhlem in her accelerated education and could identify them immediately by appearance.
0,This man was human.
0,Her eyes told her so even if her reasoning denied it.
0,In a few short minutes a plate was set on the table beside Eydis.
0,Her rescuer coaxed her to eat after handing her a fork and knife.
0,"The egg had been broken, lightly fried, and folded over an orange, mildly salted cheese."
0,"It was a crude and simple meal that only a commoner would eat, but the savory aroma was enticing."
0,She had been consoling Ceil all afternoon and into the evening until just before the attack.
0,She had forgone dinner.
0,The knotting of her empty stomach caused her mouth to water.
0,Eydis opened and closed her hand to check if her fine motor control had returned to her fingers.
0,"Holding the simple egg and cheese meal stationary with the fork, she cut off and placed a small piece in her mouth using the tip of the knife."
0,The welling tears finally fell.
0,Kind humans did exist.
0,"Chapter 5
“Language Barriers.”
Justin"
1,"7a.m. classes were the reason Justin Hapfeld woke earlier than most, and especially earlier than his roommate, Sean."
0,"This morning followed the usual routine of struggling to get out of bed, trudging down the short hall to the bathroom just beside his room, taking a quick burning hot shower to wake up, and then throwing on clothes before heading out the door to walk to campus."
0,"His apartment sat at the edge of a residential district next to the river bisecting Gullivan, and his door was on the first floor right next to a gate that led to the river’s park pathway."
0,"Each morning, Justin took the river path north about half a mile until it intersected with the Main Street Bridge, and then he followed Main Street another mile to the university he attended."
0,This routine continued every other weekday in mind-numbing monotony for the entire three and a half years he had attended.
0,He could make the trip blindfolded if need be.
0,"Every minute detail, every bush, tree, and rock along the river was so engrained in his memory that he could even tell what branches on the trees had snapped in the wind or what rocks had been kicked aside from people walking off the thin, paved path."
0,"This morning was to be just another thoughtless trek down the river in the first snow of November, just the same as every other day."
0,"Only, it was not the same."
0,"Out of the corner of Justin’s eyes, there was a strange mound of snow barely visible in the bushes only a few yards down the path from his gate."
0,"Any other passerby would have missed it or not cared enough to notice, especially this early on a freezing cold morning."
0,"Someone had likely dumped trash, which was not all that uncommon."
0,"Because it was so close to his apartment, he figured he would deal with it after returning from his classes."
0,"As he walked past, his eyes remained drawn to the mound, and the more he looked, the more unusual it appeared."
0,Something pulled his curiosity.
0,The mound of snow held an S shape bent around itself almost as if someone was curled up underneath.
0,Justin’s breath caught in his throat.
0,"He rushed over, forced his way through the thick bushes, and knelt next to the mound."
0,Brushing away the few inches of snow revealed a woman about his age with a deathly pallor.
0,"He shook her lightly, but she did not respond."
0,"The very slow rise and fall of her chest showed she was still breathing, but her breath was faint."
0,"He picked her up, surprised by how light she was despite the woman being far taller than him, and carried her into his apartment."
0,"The peculiar robe she wore repelled water, so she was not soaked save a few places on her skirt."
0,"Thankfully, this meant he wouldn’t have to undress her."
0,Justin laid her on his fabric-upholstered couch against the back wall and grabbed spare bottles to fill with hot tap water.
0,He placed them in her armpits and between her legs.
0,"He then grabbed all the blankets off his bed and spread them over her, making sure even her head was covered except her face."
0,"The woman’s teal-colored eyes followed him, and he felt himself unconsciously pulled in by them."
0,Justin knelt in front of her and smiled.
0,“Everything will be okay.” 
0,"Once he turned on the auxiliary heat in the combined kitchen living room, she quickly fell asleep."
1,"Over the next few hours, Justin checked up on her to make sure that she was warming."
0,"Color slowly returned to her face, but her breathing remained weak and strained."
0,"At about 9a.m., Sean came out and saw the woman sleeping on the couch."
0,"After Justin explained the situation, Sean raved at him for not calling the police or an ambulance."
0,"Justin had thought of doing so but decided against it, which he realized after was terribly foolish, because not doing so could have endangered her life further."
0,"His naïve reasoning was that he felt calling the police would cause more trouble for her, as if the threat of her dying of hypothermia would somehow be less trouble."
0,His excuse was based on something that he felt was completely absurd but still found difficult to ignore.
0,He did not think this woman was human.
0,"She was a foot or more taller than him, making her about six and a half feet tall, but she weighed no more than 80 lbs., probably less, and yet appeared a healthy enough size that should weigh twice as much, being rather lithe."
0,The pupils of her teal eyes were oval.
0,The final trait that could not be ignored was her ears that pointed outward about three and a half inches and narrowed to a point.
0,She looked in every way like a fantasy elf.
0,The ears could be faked.
0,There were surgeries that people could get to give themselves elf ears.
0,"Oval pupils can be caused by a rare eye defect, mutation, or due to some form of trauma and so were possible."
0,Maybe.
0,"However, there was no way someone could fake their weight."
0,Why would an elf be near frozen outside in the bushes?
0,The only reason he came to was her hiding from something or someone.
0,How did she get there in the first place?
0,"Elves shouldn’t be real, but she was real and sleeping on the couch to warm up."
0,"If he had not found her, there was a high possibility of her freezing to death."
0,There was a chance that the cold already caused serious damage.
0,"Thinking further, her low weight could be caused by prolonged malnutrition or illness causing low bone density."
0,Add severe dehydration and lack of eating for several days and her weight could almost be explained.
0,Perhaps she was so lithe because she was malnourished.
0,"Deep down, Justin knew this."
0,"Sean’s words restored his reason, and he decided to call the police, but she stopped him in fear and panic."
0,Justin looked at the pitiful woman futilely trying to hold back tears as she ate the omelet in front of her.
0,"He was not able to get a good look at her condition in his haste to warm her, but when she hurried over to stop his call, the peculiar robe she wore came off."
0,"The woman’s arms, legs, stomach, chest, all over her body were covered in long bruises as if someone had beaten her mercilessly with a broom handle or metal pipe."
0,"Seeing the bruises, he had even more reason to call the police or an ambulance, but she stopped him again."
0,What had she gone through that would make her not want to be found?
0,What caused all her injuries?
0,"To answer these questions, Justin first needed to find the means to communicate."
0,Her plea had been in a language he did not recognize.
1,"When she finished her omelet, Justin set the plate and utensils in the sink."
0,He grabbed her hand and prompted her to stand to lead her to the couch.
0,"When she sat, he wrapped another blanket around her."
0,"After kneeling on the floor in front of her, he tried introducing himself."
0,“I am Justin Hapfeld.
0,"What is your name?” Justin asked slowly, pointing at himself and then at her."
0,He made sure to emphasize the diction of each word.
0,The woman remained silent for a while and then replied in what sounded like the same language she pleaded to him before but this time just as slowly and with the same emphasis on pronunciation and diction.
0,"At least she understood that he was trying to communicate, but he still could not recognize the language."
0,"At the very least, it was not any of the major world languages he would be able to recognize even if he could not understand it."
0,Justin tried again in his terribly broken Spanish and French but received no reaction from her.
0,He then fell silent in thought.
0,"Noticing Justin’s silence, she spoke again but in a different, more fluid and melodic language that lacked hard consonants."
0,"Even when slowing down and emphasizing pronunciation, he could not tell when one word started or ended or if there even were defined breaks between words."
0,"Again, seeing Justin’s silence and confusion, she spoke in another language that was jarring and full of guttural sounds."
0,He needed to start from something far more basic.
0,Justin pointed at himself.
0,“Justin.” He then pointed at her.
0,"Repeating the gesture and his name once more, she replied."
0,"“Eydis,” she said."
0,Justin then repeated the gesture but with more words.
0,“I am Justin.” 
0,"Pointing at Eydis, he said “You are Eydis.” "
0,Eydis’s eyes lit up having come to some realization.
0,She repeated the same gestures.
0,“Thu eart Justin… Ic eom Eydis…”
0,The words Eydis spoke sounded strangely familiar.
0,Justin stood up and paced while biting the middle knuckle of the forefinger on his right hand.
0,"If he modified what she said a little, the meaning was clear."
0,“Thou art Justin.
0,I am Eydis.
0,Old English!
0,Anglo-Saxon!”
0,Justin rushed to his room and emptied the contents of his backpack.
0,"He grabbed a small and worn paperback book, Beowulf."
0,"He handed the book to Eydis, who had her hands raised in defense after his sudden outburst, and pointed at the right-side page that contained the original Old English text."
0,Eydis relaxed.
0,She held the book and stared at the page.
0,"Seemingly getting nowhere, she handed the book back to him pointing at the same page."
0,“Read?” he asked.
0,Could Eydis not read?
0,Or was the written version of Old English in the book different than what she knew?
0,"Justin’s English professor was an Old English fanatic, but he did not expect his students to be able to understand Old English."
0,"He only hoped the students would catch the similarities that made up the origins of English, similarities that Justin struggled to notice but his professor assured were there."
0,Justin was only filling a general elective requirement by taking a course that focused on ancient literature.
0,He was not an English major taking some course where the students were required to study Old English in depth.
0,"However, when starting the section of the class focusing on Beowulf, they had a quiz over the pronunciations of the strange letters and accented vowels."
0,He could at least attempt to read it.
0,"Starting from the first page, Justin read a few stanzas of the ancient epic, fumbling a bit on pronunciation."
0,"As he progressed down the first page, Eydis grew visibly excited, bordering desperation."
0,She immediately rattled off Old English far more fluent than he had ever heard his English professor speak.
0,"Regrettably, Justin had no idea what Eydis was saying; however, his English professor might."
0,Justin looked at the clock on the wall above the table to check if his professor was in office hours and took out his phone.
0,Eydis’s excitement changed to fear.
0,"She began speaking Old English again in a frantic, pleading tone."
0,Justin knelt in front of Eydis once again.
0,"Grabbing her hand, he reassured her using the softest voice he could."
0,“It’s okay.” 
0,He held the phone face up in front of her and turned it on speaker so she could hear the dial tone and any subsequent conversation.
0,He never released his gentle grip on her hand.
0,"After a brief moment, a receptionist picked up."
0,"Justin did not know the number he needed, but he knew the department office could connect him."
0,“Can you connect me to Dr. Shuman’s office?
0,I am one of his English 212 students.”
0,"After a brief wait, a raspy voice came over the phone."
0,“Ryan Shuman speaking.”
0,“Hello professor.
0,This is Justin Hapfeld from your 212 class.”
0,“Hello Justin.
0,What can I do for you?”
0,"“I have someone in front of me who does not speak English, well, modern English anyway, but she does speak Anglo-Saxon, Old English, quite fluently from the sound of it."
0,"This is a bit of an emergency situation, so I was hoping you could help.”"
0,“An emergency?
0,Is everything alright?”
0,Justin explained in brief what happened that morning but carefully worded it to sound like Eydis was fine and that there was no need for police or ambulance.
0,Whether or not the authorities needed to be involved depended on what Eydis told them.
0,Eydis listened all the while with unease on her face and her quivering hand in Justin’s grasp.
0,"After the conversation finished, Dr. Shuman introduced himself in Old English."
0,The worry melted from Eydis’s face.
0,Their conversation was brief and only so Dr. Shuman could say that he wanted to meet with her.
0,"Home visits by instructors were not permitted, so they would need to go to his office."
0,"There were parts of this situation that would make more sense in person anyway, namely Eydis herself."
0,"After Dr. Shuman received confirmation from Eydis that she was fit enough to travel, Justin set a time for later that afternoon."
0,"The tattered, silken brown, knee-length skirt that Eydis wore and the damaged robe with the blood-stained sleeve were the only clothing she had."
0,"Gesturing Eydis to stand, Justin tightened the blanket around her hips to gauge her size."
0,"His pants would fit around her thin waist with a belt, but they would obviously be too short."
0,Justin ran down the hallway to Sean’s room and grabbed a pair of his skinnier jeans.
0,Sean was about Eydis’s height.
0,He then went to his own room to look for a shirt.
0,"Eydis’s breasts were on the smaller side, so any one of Justin’s shirts would work and be slightly baggy."
0,He would give her a sweater and coat to wear over it anyway.
0,All that was left was shoes.
0,Justin placed the clothes he had retrieved on the table and lined up his foot next to Eydis’s.
0,"His feet were bigger, but not by much."
0,"If he gave her thick socks, there would be little discomfort."
0,"Seeing Justin collect clothing for her, Eydis removed the blankets and looked at her arms and chest."
0,She ran her fingers through her long golden hair and removed a small piece of dead leaf.
0,"Justin took notice of Eydis’s actions, trying his best not to stare."
0,“Do you want to take a shower?” 
1,Justin grabbed Eydis’s hand and led her into the short hallway between the table and couch and to the first door on the right.
0,"Inside the bathroom, he brought her to the tub in the back."
0,He turned the left nob and let her feel the heat of the water leaving the faucet.
0,He then turned the right nob so she could notice the water growing colder.
0,Lifting the stop on the faucet made water rain from the showerhead.
0,Eydis’s face glowed in amazement at the simple plumbing of an old shower.
0,The idea that a shower was foreign to her made him worry further.
0,How could anyone not know about showers?
0,Or perhaps she never had access to indoor plumbing.
0,"Realizing that there was a possibility that Eydis knew nothing of western toilets, he showed her how the toilet worked as well."
0,"Better to be safe, he thought."
0,"Eydis seemed grateful for the explanation, so his concern was well placed."
0,"Justin retrieved a clean towel and placed it along with the change of clothes on the counter before closing the door to give Eydis her privacy, not that she had any problems exposing herself in front of him."
0,"If Justin was being honest with himself, this whole situation was a bit overwhelming for him."
0,His emotions were in a tumult.
0,"He wanted to be helpful and reassuring after whatever it was Eydis went through, but he felt he could not do that if he kept shifting his eyes away from her."
0,"Either exposure was not seen as an issue wherever Eydis came from, or the situation Eydis was in before he found her was one where she was forced to expose herself in front of others, making her lose any care for the privacy of her own body."
0,"Justin hoped it was the former, but given the horrible state that she was in, he feared it may be the latter or similar circumstances."
0,"Whatever the reason, it could not have been good."
0,"She was beaten and in hiding, not wanting to be found, even to the point of sleeping outside in a snowstorm that very well could have killed her."
0,What if she was dumped there by some eccentric who no longer had use for her?
0,Justin’s mind weaved through crazy idea after crazy idea while he waited patiently for Eydis to finish her shower.
0,Some thoughts disturbed him while others aroused him.
0,"When he realized where his mind was wandering, he grew appalled at himself."
0,"Eydis had obviously gone through some horrible ordeal, and here he was sexualizing her part in that ordeal."
0,"“You are better than this,” Justin mumbled to himself."
0,"He made the commitment right then that no matter her exposure, no matter what she went through, he would view her as a person in need of help, nothing less."
0,"He would learn her situation when he met Dr. Shuman, or at least he hoped."
0,The police could be contacted then if necessary.
1,"After 45 minutes, the sound of the shower continued, and Justin began to worry."
0,"At an hour, Eydis had yet to finish."
0,Soon their hot water would run out if it had not already.
0,Justin placed his ear to the door.
0,He could not hear any movement or sounds that would suggest Eydis was washing or that she finished bathing but left the water running.
0,He feared the worst.
0,Justin knocked on the door.
0,“Eydis?”
0,"The sound of someone stirring came from inside, much to his relief."
0,"After a few more minutes, the shower stopped."
0,"With the noise of the shower gone, Justin could hear Eydis’s strained and erratic breathing."
0,It sounded like a severe asthma attack.
0,"“Eydis, are you okay?” Justin rapped on the door again."
0,"The sound of rustling clothes could be heard, but it was clear that Eydis was having trouble on the other side of the door."
0,Justin fought within himself whether to open it.
0,"Something collided into the door, and the knob turned."
0,"Heavy steam wafted from the bathroom, and Eydis collapsed to her knees in front of Justin."
0,He was grateful she managed to dress herself.
0,Her gasping breath sounded as if her throat was shredding.
0,"Her head hung low, and her fingers gripped the carpet."
0,She looked exactly like the height of a severe asthma attack.
0,"Justin lifted Eydis and carried her to the couch, sitting her straight."
0,"He tilted her head back to prevent the obstruction of her airway and motioned her to take in deep breaths through her nose and exhale through her mouth, emergency treatment for an asthma attack he had learned due to his younger sister having asthma."
0,"He did not know if asthma was the reason for Eydis’s condition, but he thought the same process could help."
0,"After a few minutes, Eydis’s breathing began to stabilize, but she continued breathing heavy."
0,"Once Eydis was calm enough to communicate, she placed her hand on her chest and nodded at him, stating something he could not understand but assumed was either an apology or words of gratitude."
0,Eydis moved her hand slowly in a waving motion that looked like water or perhaps air.
0,"She then placed her hand on her chest, and after saying something Justin could not understand, she moved it up and down in motion with her breathing."
0,“Is it becoming harder to breathe?” he asked.
0,Eydis then repeated the same air-like hand motions but much slower.
0,She moved her hand to her chest and repeated the breathing motions but far more exaggerated.
0,Slower air and harder breathing?
0,The speed of the air should not be a problem.
0,"If not slow, then what?"
0,Justin then realized what Eydis was trying to explain.
0,“The air is too thin?”
0,"Gullivan was against the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, high in elevation."
0,"Justin also found himself short of breath when he first moved here, having lived along the southwest coast of California at sea level for most of his life."
0,Eydis’s case may have been an extreme version of what he experienced.
0,She possibly had trouble breathing normally and the elevation only made matters worse.
0,The events in the bathroom now made sense.
0,Justin had neglected to open the thin window above the shower or turn on the fan.
0,Eydis must have used the hottest water she could tolerate to bathe.
0,The increase in steam without any ventilation may have raised humidity to a level that tipped the non-breathable scale for her.
0,"She may have been drowning in the air, if that was even possible."
0,"“I’m sorry,” Justin said, kneeling in front of Eydis with his head down, mimicking her earlier posture."
0,Eydis spoke in frantic words and coaxed Justin to stand back up.
0,"She did not seem to blame him, but he still felt terrible for his ignorance of her situation."
0,Justin returned to the bathroom and retrieved the towel.
0,He then dried her hair for her and combed it.
0,"Her golden hair was extremely fine but strong, full, and surprisingly light for its volume."
0,"Even when the comb caught, none of the hairs broke."
0,Justin added this to the list of things that made Eydis inhuman.
0,"Justin pulled Eydis to her feet, and using the pants he was wearing as an example, he showed her how to zip up and fasten the button."
0,"The pants sagged at the waist, so Justin retrieved one of his belts and began threading it through the belt loops."
0,"When threading it through the center back loop, he noticed something peculiar."
0,There was a small bump in the pants at the base of her back.
0,Did she have a tail?
0,"He had not noticed it when she wore her knee-length skirt, and it did not show below it, so if it was a tail, it would be short."
0,"There was no visible bulge other than the potential tail’s origin, so if it was longer than an inch or so, it would be hidden between her cheeks."
0,"Eydis’s nervous voice pulled Justin away from his contemplation of her possible tail, and he finished threading and fastening the belt."
0,Eydis gave him a grateful smile and gentle words with her fist pressed lightly against her chest.
0,"Even when wearing men’s clothing, or possibly because she was, she radiated a bizarre yet beautiful charm."
0,"Justin reminded himself that she was simply someone who needed his help, but he wished even more that he could understand her and she him."
0,"The strange woman must have felt the same about their inability to communicate, because in the few hours before they had to leave, Eydis handed him Beowulf and urged him to read the Old English text followed by the English text stanza by stanza."
0,"Justin continued reading to Eydis as the hours passed, only taking a brief break to eat lunch, but Eydis declined the offer for a meal."
0,"Eydis quickly picked up on the similarities between the two languages that eluded him, much to Justin’s surprise."
0,She recognized that the language of the original text derived the language he spoke and soon began stringing simple words together in English.
0,Eydis was incredibly intelligent.
0,"Chapter 6
“Emer was truly the greatest spatial mage of his time.”
Eydis"
1,The time for departure arrived.
0,"“Thank you,” Eydis told Justin, who closed and placed Beowulf on the arm of the couch."
0,"Expressing gratitude was something Eydis wanted to learn first and foremost, and Justin had been able to explain the phrase to her during the language lesson she requested of him."
0,"There was much she had to thank him for, so much that it worried her."
0,Eydis understood that she may have died if Justin had not found her.
0,Something about this strange land drastically slowed her body’s natural ven regeneration to the point where sustaining the barrier and the life magic regulating her body temperature drained ven far faster than her body could replenish it.
0,"The ven freely present in nature was all around her, even in this room, but she could not absorb it as well as she could back in the Amelian Empire or anywhere else she had previously visited."
0,"The composition felt foreign, different."
0,Using it was like adding wet fuel to a fire.
0,"The flames would decrease until the wood dried, eventually becoming something that would burn."
0,Her body was being forced to process the ven first before taking it in.
0,"Even now, she had only restored about a tenth of what she had used the previous day despite the resting she had done."
0,"She had an affinity to wind, so her connection with the natural ven in the air was strongest."
0,"It was from the air that she recovered most of her ven, at least normally."
0,Eydis wondered if the strange bitter air of this land was somehow related.
1,"Justin provided her clothing and let her bathe in his home, but she troubled him further by collapsing."
0,The air was too thin and too hard to breathe.
0,The steam from the hot water filled the air and suffocated her.
0,"Eydis tolerated it to finish bathing, but the longer she spent, the worse she grew."
0,"Before she realized how bad she had become, it was too late."
0,"Her eyes no longer focused, and her lightheadedness prevented her from moving and cutting off the water."
0,"Justin called out to her in concern, but Eydis could not let him come in on her, even if he meant well."
0,"Using what ven she could convert to wind and gather in her weakened state, she forced the steam away long enough to take deep breaths."
0,"She managed to find the energy to cut off the water and exit the tub, but using wind magic further worsened her condition."
0,It stole the air her body so desperately needed.
0,"Her head felt as if it would float away, and nothing in the small room held shape in her vision."
0,"Once Justin called again, Eydis knew he would soon enter."
0,She had endured mock death-matches as an advancement requirement in her martial training.
0,"Her last advancement match involved fighting for her life when depleted of all stamina, ven, breath, and more that was required to function normally let alone protect herself in a fight or even defeat her far more skilled instructor, Symra."
0,"Eydis had barely won at significant cost, leading Symra to request Emperor Yuro to stop her training."
0,Eydis could function without breath while being lightheaded.
0,"She frantically pulled the pants over her wet legs and pulled them up as far as she could, making sure to tuck her tail inside."
0,"She stood and pulled the shirt over her head, but the motion in her lightheadedness made her black out, and she fell forward into the door."
0,"The moment of blackness was brief, her trained body pulling her back to consciousness almost immediately."
0,She turned the knob in desperation for the air on the other side and collapsed in front of her rescuer.
0,"He quickly understood the cause of her agony and helped her breathe, saving her again."
1,"Saving her life, giving her food, providing clothing, arranging a meeting with someone with whom she could communicate, providing a bath--Eydis felt she was becoming more and more indebted to this man."
0,"Out of her own curiosity and desire to communicate, she even asked him to help her learn his language."
0,Emer’s original plan was for Eydis to exit the portal somewhere in the Amelian Empire or the neighboring allied countries where she would immediately be recognized and taken to local officials whose responsibility it would be to give her shelter and provide for her safety.
0,"Instead, she was transported into enemy territory and had to rely on the kindness of a civilian to help and conceal her."
0,"Justin’s exchange with the taller man was proof that she was unwelcome or that her presence would cause Justin and him trouble, especially with humans breaking their ceasefire in the most heinous manner possible."
0,"Despite these risks, Justin continued helping her, and she had nothing to give him in return."
0,"If any guards discovered that Justin sheltered Eydis instead of reporting her immediately, that would be grounds for immediate execution."
0,What could she offer him that would balance out the risk he was taking?
0,"Eydis’s mind circled around the rewards the empire would give him, sanctuary and monetary compensation among others."
0,But the current state of the Amelian Empire was unknown.
0,"By now, the news of the death of her family would have spread through various information channels."
0,There was no telling what panic or chaos could be ensuing right now or if the assassinations were just the precursor to a far grander scheme.
0,"The kingdom of the humans, Tolmyur, almost evenly matched the Amelian Empire’s strength; the magical superiority being on the empire’s side, but the physical strength and sheer numbers being on the human’s side."
0,"However, fighting that human assassin that surpassed even her mentor in spatial magic and seeing the magical communication device that each human here seemed to possess, Eydis could no longer say with any certainty that the empire held magical superiority over the humans."
0,"If there were others with the same strength in magic as that assassin, if there were many more like him, the empire would fall."
0,How then would she be able to repay Justin?
0,"She could make all the promises in the world, but they would fall empty depending on the outcome of the war."
0,The possibility even existed that the two men would not accept a promise with no guarantee of fulfillment and instead expected to be paid outright.
0,What could she offer then?
0,She had nothing.
0,Eydis’s heart sank as the chilling caress of unease ran its fingers down her spine.
0,"She hated herself for realizing it, but there was something she could offer, as a woman."
0,"She did not want such an arrangement and could not make such an arrangement given her status, but what if Justin or that other man requested or demanded it of her?"
0,The very thought made her legs tremble.
0,The heir to the Amelian Empire being taken by human commoners would bring shame to the empire no different than losing the war.
0,"Eydis would have to turn them down and leave, but what would happen to her then?"
0,Would someone being sheltered in enemy territory at the risk of the death of her saviors have the right to refuse?
0,"While Eydis worried over the nature of her situation, Justin returned carrying a blue knitted cap and matching scarf, a grey sweater, and a brown coat."
0,He looked at her shaking frame and coaxed her to sit back down.
0,Her trepidation had been mistaken for physical weakness.
0,Eydis tried to assure him that she was alright and donned the sweater.
0,"Justin then wrapped the scarf around Eydis’s neck and placed the cap over her head, tucking her pointed ears inside."
0,"Placing his hands over her concealed ears, Justin looked Eydis in the eyes and spoke to her in a serious tone, his gaze unshaken."
0,"Although Eydis did not understand his words, she knew the meaning."
0,“Keep your ears hidden.” 
0,Eydis’s situation was exactly as she had feared: other humans discovering that she was an elf was dangerous for them both.
1,Justin led Eydis out the door and locked it behind him.
0,Eydis looked around at the building.
0,It was a tenement at the edge of a residential district.
0,He lived on the bottom floor with what appeared to be two more residences to the left.
0,"If the second floor held the same number, there were six in total for the tenement, all much smaller in size compared to the shingle-roofed residences she could see from the walled-in, paved pathway in front of his door."
0,The paving was cracked and crumbling in disrepair at the edges.
0,The metal columns supporting the walk of the second floor were chipping and rusted in places.
0,"In direct contrast to the amazing machinery and technology, the appliances and heated water his home provided--his abundant wealth compared to the poverty she expected of the average human--a dark worry struck her that Justin might be a lower-class citizen, at least lower than those who lived in the quality structures surrounding the tenement."
0,No government at war would hesitate to kill a lower-class citizen for harboring the enemy.
0,She doubted humans would even hesitate to kill a noble for helping her.
0,Eydis’s hands rose subconsciously to cover her ears under the woven cap as if its thick weave was not sufficient to hide the soft cartilage underneath.
0,Justin led Eydis the opposite direction from the other houses and through a gate that opened to a path along the riverside.
0,"After only walking a short distance, Eydis noticed a patch of disturbed leaves and snow partially concealed in bushes."
0,"Eydis had thought that she was far enough separate from civilization in some wooded area, but the truth was that there were homes on the other side of the wall of trees just across the path from where she slept."
0,"There was little choice but for her to be discovered; however, being discovered by Justin saved her life."
0,Eydis and Justin continued walking down the river path towards a large metal and stone bridge.
0,Similar beings to the one she had seen the night before crossed at incredible speeds.
0,"They were many different shapes, sizes, and colors."
0,The diversity of the monsters was astounding.
0,"As they neared the bridge, Eydis realized they were not monsters but closer to fast-moving metal carriages."
0,"She felt terribly embarrassed by the assumptions caused by her fears, but the contraptions were unlike anything she had ever seen before, so she had to remind herself that such misunderstandings were normal."
0,Or should be normal.
0,"She had never been in a situation like this, and she did not doubt that anyone else from Amel would have made the same mistake had they never been to the human territory."
0,"None of the carriages had flares or the means to produce them on top like the one she encountered the night before, so the one summoned by that man had been special, possibly meant solely for the town guard or whatever the role of that man was."
0,She couldn’t even begin to guess.
0,"Everything in this city was too foreign, too different."
0,The river path continued under the bridge.
1,Justin led Eydis up cobblestone steps on the other side to the road.
0,"Eydis had been enduring their brief trek, but after climbing the steps, she needed to rest."
0,"Her lungs pleaded for air, but it was in such short supply."
0,She had to wonder how Justin was so unaffected by the thin air.
0,His breath was so light that he almost looked as if he wasn’t breathing at all.
0,Eydis pulled on Justin’s sleeve and motioned that she wanted to sit down.
0,"She could push through, but she did not want to end up in a state that would trouble Justin even more than a short rest."
0,"Thankfully, Justin understood her silent gesticulation and led her a short distance away from the bridge to a blue bench with a sign attached to the corner."
0,Eydis leaned her head back on the bench like Justin had shown her before and noticed again that she could breathe a little easier.
0,"Once she felt better, Eydis spent her rest looking around at the peculiar buildings and people along the road."
0,"As expected of the human kingdom, it was highly populated."
0,"The buildings were all simple rectangles in shape, but the colors and expensive, clear glass windows advertised their exquisite quality."
0,The number of automated metal carriages was astounding.
0,"The empire could never hope to craft such machines, and this city alone had so many."
0,What would happen if the humans were to use metal carriages specialized in combat in the war?
0,"Even the carriages used by the civilians appeared impervious to arrows, blades, and other martial weaponry."
0,They looked as if they could withstand weaker magic.
0,"Given the offensive capabilities of the assassin, there was no doubt in Eydis’s mind that the humans had the ability to make carriages capable of withstanding advanced magic."
0,Eydis knew.
0,The empire would lose this war.
0,"While eyeing the carriages and people, another strange realization came to Eydis."
0,"There were no giants, dwarves, or minums among the populous."
0,Humans came in four breeds.
0,Minums were the ruling race of Tolmyur and lived north of the deserts in more fertile lands along the largest river on the continent.
0,"The ‘mi’ in their name meant river in their tongue, ‘num’ meaning people."
0,They appeared in every way the same as general humans aside from being half the height.
0,"They were the magical power of the human races, usually having affinities to multiple elements."
0,"General humans, or sotnum in the minum tongue, the primary language of Tolmyur, were the most populous due to their high proliferation."
0,‘Sot’ meant ‘west’ since the humans originated from the same lands as the elves before migrating east to the deserts.
0,"They had minor magical capabilities and average athleticism, a well-rounded race."
0,"Dwarves, the mountain-folk or doknum, were short and stout and usually specialized in a single magical affinity."
0,"While stronger than the general humans, they were slower than both humans and giants, and so dwarves would often lose to them and other athletic races in physical combat."
0,This led them to combine magic with martial skill to terrifying results.
0,"They had once been a longstanding ally of the elves before the creation of the Amelian Empire, but regrettably they joined under Tolmyur’s banner."
0,"Giants, called seknum in Tolmyur since they were a seafaring people who lived along the coasts of the deserts, stood up to one and a half times the height of general humans and possessed no magic ability, but their physical ability far surpassed any of the elfkind, even the large-bodied male Mountain Elves."
0,"Even in a city with a high population of general humans, Eydis assumed there should still be at least a few of the other breeds mixed in."
0,"Eydis had seen one short, stout woman that could have been a dwarf, but she lacked the other physical markers of the race."
0,"Any minum Eydis thought she saw was only a child, and there were no giants to be seen anywhere."
0,A tap on Eydis’s shoulder woke her from her contemplation.
0,"Justin pointed down the road at a rather large, blue, rectangular carriage."
0,It pulled to a stop in front of them filled with people.
1,Justin waited for a few to exit and then pulled Eydis inside.
0,He placed the communication device he carried on a small pedestal by the entrance until the color at the top changed from blue to green.
0,He then repeated the motion a second time and led Eydis to the back where she could sit down in the only unoccupied seat.
0,Justin stood next to her and held onto a rod that extended down from the ceiling and attached to the corner of her seat.
0,Eydis watched out the window in amazement as the carriage crossed the bridge at an incredible speed but grew disappointed when it slowed to a stop so soon to let off more passengers and take on others.
0,"This carriage, or perhaps a passenger wagon might be a closer analogy, served the purpose of transportation for those who lacked access to carriages of their own."
0,The infrastructure of human society was amazing.
0,There was no equal to it in the empire.
0,"After a few more stops, Justin pulled on a wire above him."
0,"The carriage stopped once again, and Justin led Eydis out its door."
1,The scenery where they exited was different from along the river.
0,The buildings were far larger and more spread out.
0,"The architecture changed from building to building, some even resembling simple red-brick fortresses lacking external walls or other defensive fortifications."
0,One had pillars at its entrance atop some twenty or thirty steps.
0,Another was a simple rectangle in shape covered in nothing but pristine glass with a green tint.
0,"Long cement paths led to and from buildings with wide grass clearings between, decorated with sparse trees and shrubbery that were well cultivated."
0,"Benches lined some paths, but none were in use."
0,Most of those walking outside preferred to get to their destinations and out of the cold quickly.
0,Eydis began to worry about whether this was a government facility.
0,What else could explain the apparent affluence?
0,In the end she could only trust Justin.
0,Justin led Eydis along paths between the structures.
0,"Eydis found that the vast majority of people here were young adults, many with packs on their backs or books in their hands."
0,"The packs would suggest this was a destination for travelers, which might explain why there was someone who understood foreign languages."
0,Perhaps it was affiliated with city customs.
0,"Then again, wouldn’t customs be better located near points of entry?"
0,There was also little evidence that the buildings were inns or taverns where travelers would congregate.
0,The truth had to relate to the books and documents many carried.
0,"Perhaps this was a large archival complex, but what purpose would a city have for one so grand?"
0,"She had learned that minums traditionally were adept recordkeepers, but this was clearly a human city, not minum."
0,"When Eydis noticed two men younger than Justin near the entrance of one of the structures conversing with a much older woman as she explained and pointed at some document atop a book one of the men carried, Eydis found her answer."
0,This was an educational institution.
0,Did Justin have connections here?
0,"If so, did that mean that even lower-class citizens of the Tolmyur Kingdom had access to education?"
0,Eydis watched in amazement the students passing by.
0,"The number suggested that most young adults in this city attended here, if her estimation of the city’s size during her brief travel was anywhere near correct."
0,"The humans were not only far more technologically advanced, but they might also treat their people better than her empire treated her own."
0,Everything Eydis had learned about the human Kingdom of Tolmyur was being turned on its tail with each new revelation.
0,"Due to the large population of humans, insufficient resources created widespread poverty with only the merchant and upper class being able to live comfortably, and even their affluence would be poor by the Amelian Empire’s standards."
0,Humans bore many children from very young ages due to the high mortality rate of youth and to supply more workhands.
0,"Organized education was non-existent, and most humans were either taught the trade of their parents or were conscripted into the army."
0,"The lucky ones who avoided conscription ended up becoming hunter mercenaries, farmhands, or apprentices of craftsmen without children of their own."
0,"The unlucky joined bandit groups, became slaves, or starved to death."
0,The Tolmyur Kingdom was supposed to be an oppressive absolute monarchy.
0,Eydis had to wonder if she was taught lies.
0,"The advanced infrastructure, well-dressed appearances, high quality shops, public education, and cheerful demeanor of the people all shattered Eydis’s mental perception of human life."
1,"Justin brought Eydis into one of the plainer looking, but rather tall, structures that had interchanging layers of glass windows and red brick at every floor."
0,"Taking her to a small room off from the entrance, he pressed a small, upward-facing arrow symbol on the wall next to a metal door."
0,The symbol promptly lit up.
0,"After a moment, the metal door opened leading to an even smaller room that could fit no more than ten people if packed tight."
0,The only adornment was a simple handrail that ran along the breadth of each wall.
0,Eydis followed him inside with no shortage of unease.
0,"There were no doors other than the one they entered, and there were no windows."
0,She could not understand the purpose of this tiny room.
0,"Justin pressed one of many circular symbols beside the door, and the doors closed, trapping them in."
0,Eydis grabbed the sleeve of Justin’s coat.
0,He looked up at her with an assuring smile that almost looked amused.
0,"Without saying a word, he pointed upward."
0,"Gravity in the room increased, causing Eydis to yelp lightly in surprise at first, but the increase was pleasant and a little closer to what it felt like in the empire."
0,"Beside her, Justin fought to hold in a snicker, making Eydis feel a little self-conscious."
0,"The sensation soon ended, and the doors opened."
0,The windows showed they were now on the top floor of the building.
0,"The reason for the increase in gravity was the room raising upwards--an automated pulley system, perhaps."
0,This was another fascinating human technology.
0,Eydis followed Justin down a mostly deserted hallway to a row of wooden doors.
0,"Justin knocked on one near the end, and a familiar raspy voice answered."
1,Justin opened the door and led Eydis inside.
0,The small room had an outward facing window in the back covered in vertical and evenly spaced slats.
0,"The window revealed the campus, city, and mountains not far in the distance."
0,"A bookshelf was mounted on the wall to the left, and a desk wrapped around below the window and along the right wall."
0,An elderly human man who appeared to be about five years old sat in a black leather chair.
0,His disheveled white hair and chin-strap beard gave the look of an academic.
0,"Eydis found this assumption reasonable if this was an institute of learning, and only a scholar would invest his brief human lifespan to learn the language of the sprites who were an extreme minority even in the Amelian Empire."
0,"After a word of greeting to Justin, the elderly man turned to Eydis."
0,"“I am pleased to meet you,” he said in the familiar tongue of the sprites."
0,“Please sit in the chair beside you.”
0,"Eydis sat down as instructed, but there were only two chairs, so Justin leaned back against the wall beside the door."
0,"His relaxed posture in front of his elder and superior struck Eydis as bizarre, and she feared there might be repercussions, but Shuman did not seem to mind."
0,"Perhaps he was mild-mannered or forgiving of such benign insults, but to be safe, Eydis sat straight with her hands clasped in her lap, legs close together, and her ankles politely crossed."
0,"She was a princess, but in her current situation, Shuman was the highest authority and deserving of respect."
0,Shuman spoke with Justin and asked a few questions to which Justin gave concise replies.
0,"Satisfied, Shuman faced Eydis once again."
0,"“Justin tells me that you do not speak English, but you know other tongues that he has not heard."
0,How many do you speak?”
0,Shuman’s knowledge of the language was what Eydis had expected.
0,He spoke in the slow and simple words of one who knew the language of the sprites but was not fluent.
0,"Although most people spoke multiple languages, those with enough education to speak many languages fluently were few and far between."
0,Telling the truth about how many languages she spoke may raise suspicion against her or at least hint her social status.
0,"However, Justin would not have brought her to this man if he did not trust him at some level."
0,"After careful contemplation, she decided to answer."
0,Being a polyglot did not immediately mean she was royalty.
0,“I speak one hundred and thirteen languages and dialects.”
0,Shuman’s eyes widened and he leaned back in his chair.
0,“Does that mean you speak most of the major tongues in the world?”
0,Shuman’s statement surprised Eydis.
0,The languages and dialects in the Amelian Empire alone numbered nearly one hundred.
0,"If she included the neighboring countries and territories, they increased to multiple thousands, and that was just one of the smaller continents of Whinhlem."
0,"Including the beastkin who populated the rest of Whinhlem, the world had hundreds of thousands of languages if their various dialects were included."
0,"There were, of course, the major political and commerce languages that most people of every country knew or could at least understand, but each race and society strongly held onto the language of their origin, and that practice was widely accepted all over the world."
0,The only way a language would die out would be the extinction of the race that spoke it.
0,"Even the humans, giants, dwarves, and minums had their own separate languages and accompanying dialects with Common Minum being used universally throughout Tolmyur."
0,"Was Shuman not educated after all, or was their education suppressed to include only what was needed within human society?"
0,"If that was the case, having only one hundred languages made sense."
0,Eydis had to make certain.
0,“How many languages are there in the world?”
0,Shuman thought for a moment.
0,"“From what I know, there are about eight thousand.”"
0,"“Do you understand this language,” Eydis asked in the Common Minum dialect she had learned."
0,"“I am sorry,” Shuman replied."
0,“I do not know what you said.”
0,How could a human scholar not even know the common tongue of the humans?
0,"There was an obvious answer, and Eydis felt a fool that she had not realized sooner."
0,“What is the name of this nation?”
0,Shuman looked visibly perplexed.
0,“I do not know how to say it.
0,Please wait.” He pulled a book from a shelf above his desk and flipped through the pages.
0,"After jumping from location to location, page to page, he inserted it back on the shelf and sat down."
0,“I could not find a good way to say it.
0,"In English, we call it ‘The United States of America’.”"
0,“This is not the Tolmyur Kingdom?
0,Can you show me a map?”
0,Shuman did not react to the mention of Tolmyur.
0,He turned around to the large black slate mounted on a stand sitting atop his desk.
0,Moving a small object on the desk lit the slate.
0,It was a larger version of the communication device that all humans carried.
0,Soon what resembled a map appeared.
0,Shuman turned the slate towards Eydis and moved away.
0,"It was then that Eydis realized the chairs in which she and Shuman sat had small wheels attached to the bottom, so she slid her chair in front of the map mimicking the light motions of Shuman’s legs to take caution against any uncouth movements."
0,The land masses and bodies of water looked nothing like anything she had formerly seen on maps at the palace.
0,There was the possibility that these were only small islands that she would not have noticed when looking at the full world map.
0,“Where are these islands located?” she asked.
0,“I do not know what you mean.”
0,“Can you show me the whole world map?”
0,"“This is the world map,” Shuman replied, perplexed."
0,“Where are we?” 
0,Shuman rolled his chair next to Eydis and requested access to the small hand device.
0,Moving it also moved a small white arrow on the slate.
0,Shuman motioned the arrow in a circle around the center of the northwestern landmass.
0,“Here.”
0,The map then expanded to focus on the area Shuman had circled.
0,Map details were added and became more visible.
0,Eydis gasped in astonishment despite herself.
0,"Rivers, lakes, and mountains formed."
0,"What looked like cities dotted the landscape, and their size was easily visible."
0,These were not small islands but small continents.
0,The entire Amelian Empire would almost fit inside the continent Shuman highlighted.
0,"Out the window behind the desk, Eydis noticed that the sun was already setting when it should still be midday."
0,"She sat slack in her chair, too dumbstruck to worry about keeping appearances."
0,Is this real?
0,Is this world not Whinhlem?
0,Where am I?
0,"Seeing Eydis’s reaction, Shuman spoke with Justin."
0,Their conversation lasted for some time.
0,“Justin says there is a lot about you that is not…”
0,Shuman paused for a moment like he was trying to find the right way to express what he wanted to say.
0,Justin intervened.
0,"He made the motions of removing her woven cap, suggesting that Eydis should be up front to Shuman about who she was."
0,Eydis was apprehensive.
0,Justin knew she was an elf and had taken precautions so that this truth would not be revealed.
0,Was it safe to reveal the truth to Shuman as well?
0,"Again, Eydis’s training told her to abstain from any action that could endanger her, and again Eydis had to suppress its impulse."
0,"She was taught to survive in many varying situations, but in all her training, she had never been told how to act when brought to another world."
0,"How could Evhial, Symra, or Emer ever predict such an event occurring?"
0,"Although, Emer was the one who sent her to this world."
0,"If he had such ability, he should have taught her how to interact with the natives of a new world."
0,"In the end, she had little choice but to trust Justin, and therefore trust Shuman."
0,She removed her woven hat.
0,Her pointed ears sprung outwards flicking out strands of hair with them.
0,This time it was Shuman who sat back in his chair dumbstruck.
0,He asked some worried question to Justin who in turn replied with a serious answer.
0,"Justin pointed at his eyes, ears, and lower back in his explanation and then held out his arms as if carrying something."
0,"After hearing Justin’s explanation, Shuman leaned forward to get a better look at Eydis’s eyes and ears."
0,“Are you an elf?” He asked.
0,Eydis held back her answer.
0,"If these humans were as hostile to elves as those in the Tolmyur Kingdom, even if they were not at war, or especially if they had connections with the Tolmyur Kingdom, confessing herself a High Elf would be the end of her freedom and possibly result in execution."
0,"Then again, Shuman did not react to her mention of Tolmyur."
0,Eydis looked back at Justin with worry pained in her face.
0,Justin replied with a reassuring smile and nodding head.
0,Eydis lowered her head and tensed.
0,Every emotion within her was telling her to remain silent or lie.
0,"Humans killed her family, a reality that she was constantly trying to push to the back of her mind to focus on what was happening at this moment."
0,Everything Shuman had shown her could have been fabricated.
0,She may still be in danger.
0,But… Justin would not have taken her here if he did not trust Shuman.
0,"He had already done so much for her, too much to reason off as a means to some convoluted deception ploy to earn her trust to capture her."
0,"If it was all a lie, then she could not fault herself for believing it."
0,"Taking a deep breath, Eydis spoke."
0,“I am a High Elf of the Amelian Empire.” Eydis’s ears drooped slightly after her confession.
0,She readied an emergency teleportation formula in case the worst occurred.
0,She set the destination to the far side of one of the mountains she could see in the distance from the small room’s window.
0,Shuman exhaled loudly and leaned back in his chair.
0,"“Now I know why you speak Anglo-Saxon,” he said with his hand still covering his mouth as if it had somehow grown attached."
0,"Sitting upright, he continued."
0,“Elves are from old Germanic stories and were known as the white spirits of the forests.
0,You said you were from the Amelian Empire.
0,I do not know it.
0,How did you come here?”
0,Eydis could sense no deception in Shuman’s words.
0,Perhaps these humans had no connection with the Tolmyur Kingdom.
0,"The fear welling up within her abated, albeit only slightly, but she felt safe enough to explain what happened the night before."
0,“I escaped an assassin.” 
1,"Shuman and Justin listened awestruck as Eydis recited the calamity that had befallen her family, but she left out the details about humans being the perpetrators, fearing that it might cause some misunderstanding or make them think there was a condemning reason the humans of her world were hostile towards elfkind."
0,"Shuman translated each statement for Justin as she spoke, looking up words in his book that he was unsure of and filling in guesses where no translation could be found."
0,"By the end, Justin sat on the floor."
0,Her tale overwhelmed him.
0,“So…” Shuman spoke up after a moment of silence.
0,"“If this is all true, you are the princess and next queen of the Amelian Empire?”"
0,"“Next empress, yes,” Eydis replied."
0,"“I do not want to doubt you, but things like magic and elves do not exist in this world."
0,They are only stories.
0,"If it is not too much to ask, could you show your story is true by using some magic?"
0,True magic?”
0,Eydis understood that Shuman’s emphasis on the word “true” meant he desired proof that could not be seen as a trick or illusion or explained through other means.
0,"The request was trivial, and she was more than willing to comply."
0,"“It is more difficult for me to use the ven here, but I can.”"
0,"Shuman had a very small, leafy plant in a pot in the windowsill behind his desk."
0,"It was in the peak of health, suggesting that Shuman took great care of it."
0,“May I see that plant?”
0,Shuman handed Eydis the small ceramic planter.
0,“Do not hurt it.” 
0,Eydis gathered life ven in her hand and touched the stem of the small plant between her thumb and forefinger.
0,Fresh branches and leaves grew before their eyes.
0,The growth was small but very noticeable.
0,Eydis stopped at the point where going further might endanger the plant with its current nutrient levels.
0,She then handed back the planter.
0,Shuman examined and touched the fresh leaves.
0,"“In all my fifty-eight years, I never thought I would see true magic.”"
0,Eydis was stunned.
0,Shuman looked no older than five.
0,"Humans had a lifespan of about five to six years, but some lived to seven."
0,Members of elfkind lived to be about 80 with High Elves commonly reaching 90 to 100 years of age.
0,How could a human live so long?
0,“Can you ask Justin his age?”
0,"After a brief exchange, Shuman responded."
0,“He is 23.”
0,This broke all knowledge Eydis had on human biology.
0,"Eydis was only halfway through her fourth year of life, yet Justin looked no older than she."
0,Were these people not human?
0,"This was another world, so humans might be different here."
0,Eydis reached another realization.
0,This world was different.
0,This was no better proven than by the map she had seen.
0,The map suggested that this world was smaller than hers.
0,"Her first instructor, Evhial, had taught her that the larger the body, the larger the gravitational pull."
0,The opposite would then be true.
0,"The reason she felt lighter, and possibly why the air was thinner, was because this world was small."
0,The days were also about half the length of those from her world.
0,None of the knowledge about her world would apply here.
0,"If the measurement of years was also different, then the ages of Justin and Shuman could be explained."
0,They might still be human.
0,“How many days are in your year?” Eydis asked.
0,"“365 and one fourth part,” Shuman replied."
0,Eydis was puzzled about the fraction of a day that was included but thought it best to ignore.
0,"However, the number alone meant little."
0,Eydis could no longer make any assumptions.
0,“How do you measure your numbers?”
0,"Shuman looked puzzled and then asked Justin, possibly for clarification or an idea of what she meant."
0,"Coming to a conclusion, Justin held up all ten digits of his hands."
0,"Eydis understood that this meant their number system was likely base ten, something she felt was rather primitive, but she could understand the ease it made simple calculations although at the cost of complicating division due to the lack of divisors the base allowed."
0,The common folk of Whinhlem often measured their numbers the same.
0,Eydis requested something to write on.
0,Shuman handed her a high-quality piece of parchment and an odd-looking writing instrument.
0,"It was transparent, and the ink appeared to be held in a tube inside of it removing the need for an inkwell."
0,Or perhaps it could be better stated that the inkwell was inside the pen.
0,It was fascinating.
0,She worked out the conversion of 365 from base ten.
0,She then used her observed length of the day in this world to estimate how many days their year would be in hers.
0,"Finishing the math, she was ready to report her findings, or rough estimates at least."
0,“A year in my world would be just under twelve in yours.
0,This would make me about fifty-five in your years.”
0,"“You age well,” Shuman jested, visibly trying to hold back his surprise."
0,"“Elves do age much slower than humans in my world, so perhaps it is the same here."
0,"I am physically an adult, but I am also still considered to be in my youth because I have not become independent."
0,"High Elves like myself live to be…” Eydis paused to mentally calculate the years, having already grown accustomed to the simple base conversion, “We live for about one thousand years in your time.”"
0,"Shuman explained to Justin the reason for Eydis’s out-of-place questions along with her age, but Justin did not appear surprised."
0,"Instead, he spoke some serious words back at Shuman who nodded in agreement."
0,“Justin wants us to return to topic.”
0,"Eydis realized that she had moved their conversation in an unimportant direction, overcome by her curiosity."
0,"“Your family was killed, and your teacher sent you to this world, correct?” Shuman asked."
0,Eydis nodded.
0,“Do you think there is a way to send you back to your world?”
0,“I do not know.
0,I am an amateur in that school of magic and nowhere close to the abilities of Emer.
0,Sending someone to another world is magic I cannot begin to understand.
0,Emer must have done it because my assassin was another mage of equal or higher ability.
0,He had easily traced our attempted escapes until this one.
0,I did not even know Emer was capable of such grand magic.”
0,Shuman grew troubled.
0,“You said your assassin was the same or stronger than Emer.
0,Is there a chance that he could still come for you?”
0,"“My destination was randomized, and Emer stayed behind to scramble the trace… the remnants of the magic left behind after its casting,” she explained quickly."
0,"“My assassin has not followed, so I want to believe that Emer succeeded."
0,"I cannot say for certain, but I do not think it would be possible for the assassin to follow me.”"
0,“Are you sure?”
0,Eydis considered all the theories and laws of teleportation she had learned from Emer.
0,"Emer would never lie to her about the capabilities of his own magical specialty, especially considering she would become empress."
0,Doing so would be tantamount to occupational suicide leaning on the side of treason.
0,"“Yes, everything I have learned says it is impossible, but… I also thought teleporting to another world was impossible."
0,"The assassin used magic I had never seen before too, so for him… I cannot guess.”"
0,"Chapter 7
“Friends are those with whom you can confide.”
Eydis"
1,Eydis sat at the back of a small lecture hall.
0,She grew fascinated by the angular table that rose from between her seat and the one next to it and folded down over her lap.
0,She spent a few minutes in an inquisitive fever repeating the raising and folding motions and admiring the peculiar hinge that made such movements possible.
0,The few occupants sitting among the tiered seating of the hall watched her in confusion.
0,"Each student in the room was not skilled in the language of this country, English."
0,Eydis received special permission from Dr. Shuman after their meeting yesterday to attend an English course designed for foreign students.
0,"The timing of the course near-perfectly coincided with the time Justin was earning money, making it quite advantageous."
0,"When Eydis asked about Justin’s job, he simply replied, “I answer questions.” Eydis was curious to what kind of occupation such a cryptic answer could apply and landed on the only possibility on Whinhlem, an information broker."
0,The lower class of many large cities was often the priviest to the rumors and secrets of the city.
0,"The most knowledgeable among them would sell this information to others, if the price was good enough."
0,Perhaps Justin leveraged his tutelage within the institution to gain access to broader information channels.
0,It was a dangerous profession that paid poorly for most information but held the potential for great reward for rare and dangerous knowledge.
0,"The more difficult to obtain and dangerous the information, the higher the risk to the broker’s life, especially considering the greatest of rumors were often detrimental to the person who was the topic of the rumor, and so they would want to silence the spread as a matter of course."
0,"If Justin lived with that kind of risk daily, she better understood why he would be willing to house an unknown person who was the target of a very powerful assassin."
0,"After the meeting with Dr. Shuman ended, the topic arose of where Eydis would stay."
0,Dr. Shuman raised concern about having a young woman stay in an apartment with two other men but was unable to provide her shelter himself.
0,"He was willing, but his relationship with his wife was currently strained, and she rejected the idea of him bringing home a younger woman without giving him a chance to explain the situation."
0,"Allegedly, he had affairs in the past."
0,Eydis could understand the feelings of a wife who would easily mistake this act of kindness as taking in a much younger mistress.
0,Their relationship would only worsen if his wife would not accept Eydis’s presence in his home.
0,"In the end, Justin agreed to take care of Eydis until something more permanent could be set up."
0,"The only hurdle was the other resident, Sean."
0,Justin talked to Sean that evening and explained the situation but made sure to leave out the information about Eydis’s origin and the assassin targeting her.
0,"Persuading Sean was difficult, but he agreed under strict terms."
0,"Eydis had to find some way to earn money, and when possible, she would find her own place to live."
0,Their home only had two personal rooms with a single bed each.
0,"For the time being, Justin agreed to sleep on the couch, giving Eydis his bed."
0,"Eydis refused such generosity at first, but Justin would not budge, so she had little choice but to give in to his kindness with an unspoken promise to herself to repay him when able."
0,Finding a way to earn money was difficult for Eydis in her current situation.
0,She was an illegal resident of this country and did not know the language.
0,"Eydis was at least grateful that Sean had not requested her to repay them outright, and she sought every opportunity to gain his favor after seeing how angry he became when Justin saved her."
0,She wanted to find work so that she would not be pressured into unfavorable methods of repayment.
0,Her request to be taught the English language was a means to this end and led to her seat in this lecture.
0,"By the end of the lecture, Eydis was relieved at the similarities between English and the sprite tongue, more so than she previously thought."
0,"Understanding the lecture was extremely difficult, but reading with Justin on her first day helped immensely."
0,Her conversations with Dr. Shuman and this lecture from one of his associates built Eydis’s confidence in her understanding of the basic grammatical structure of the language.
0,"She would only need to learn the vocabulary, their conjugations, and practice as much as possible to grow accustomed to the pragmatics; however, this was the cause for frustration due to the number of conflicting rules and exceptions in English."
0,Eydis understood that many languages absorbed parts of others to develop.
0,She only wished that English had picked the rules of the languages it assimilated and incorporated those rules universally throughout instead of using haphazard combinations of conflicting rules.
1,Eydis closed the small pocket-sized grammar book Dr. Shuman had given her and let out a sigh.
0,"The more she read, the more annoyed she became."
0,"Of all the languages she had studied, this was the first language she felt was not worth learning, and yet it was the only one she needed to learn for the sake of her own survival."
0,Eydis slouched in a padded chair of an empty foyer where Justin had instructed her to wait.
0,It was only about 200 square feet in size and contained a single couch and chair.
0,The double doors between the chair and sofa led to the second-floor balcony seats of an old lecture hall.
0,"When she peaked in the doors out of curiosity, the room almost reminded her of a much, much smaller version of the grand council chamber of the Amelian palace, except everything was fashioned of wood instead of marble."
0,It could fit maybe two hundred students on the first floor and half that on the balcony seats.
0,"The foyer only had two entrances, and Justin chose it for their meetup location due to how few people passed through the connected stairs to the hall’s first floor and the hallway that extended about ten yards opposite the double doors before turning corner out of sight."
0,A little time remained before Justin would return.
0,She tried to keep occupied to prevent herself from mourning the death of her family or drowning in worry over what was happening in the empire with her family gone.
0,"The sight of her brothers severed in half lying in their own gore flashed in her mind the moment she let her mind wander, and the mere thought of her parents, brothers, and Ceil caused her heart to ache with an acute pain."
0,"But, she also felt that any further study into the English language would only lead to frustration."
0,"Tilting her head back, Eydis decided to practice her deep breathing and focus on her ven regeneration to help her body better process the unfamiliar ven of this world."
0,Eydis closed her eyes and fell into a trance.
0,“Do you think I am not aware you were stalking me?”
0,“I wasn’t stalking you.
0,I just wanted to apologize for last night.”
0,Eydis woke abruptly from her trance because of the angry voice of a girl.
0,Eydis quickly corrected her assumption.
0,"It was a woman, not a young girl, though she was quite short."
0,The woman had shoulder-length brown hair with a mild wave that made the ends curl out in random directions.
0,Her face was round but well enough proportioned to accentuate her doll-like cheeks and subtle jawline that would have made Eydis immediately think of young nobility if not for her crass tone of speech.
0,She walked beside another much taller man with hair colored a slightly darker shade of brown.
0,He talked back to her in a stern tone while rubbing the stubble on his chin.
0,"Upon closer inspection, they were not walking together."
0,"When he jumped ahead a pace, she briskly stepped further ahead."
0,"When he placed his hand on her shoulder to turn her to face him, she swatted it away."
0,"She wanted him to leave, but he wouldn’t."
0,"When they reached the foyer, the woman turned to face him and started jamming her finger into his chest which was at the level of her face."
0,“I’m not some cheap whore who can be bought off with a meal!”
0,"When she tried to walk away, the man walked in front of her pleading with outstretched arms for her to wait and hear him out."
0,Eydis did not understand the full nature of their conversation but felt that the woman could use help.
0,She stood and walked between her and the man.
0,“Leave alone.”
0,"“This has nothing to do with you,” the man replied, but he then froze with a creeping smile."
0,"“Leave alone,” Eydis repeated."
0,"“He’s not worth the trouble,” the woman spat."
0,The man stepped back to look Eydis in the eyes.
0,"His gaze then wandered down to her chest, then hips and waist, looking mildly disappointed that her form was hidden under her thick clothing."
0,“You want to hang out some time?
0,I know the best clubs in the city.”
0,"Eydis did not understand the man, but she knew he had changed his target."
0,His overconfident grin that said she would be his made her skin crawl.
0,"When he stepped closer, Eydis’s training instinct triggered."
0,"She pushed the man in the chest while simultaneously expelling wind with force, barely managing to catch herself to avoid using any magic that would be harmful."
0,The man flew back to the other side of the small foyer and rolled once when he hit the ground.
0,“You go!” Eydis shouted.
0,The man used the wall to stand and stumbled away down the stairs without looking back.
0,It was then that Eydis realized what she had just done.
0,"In her disgust, she reflexively used magic in front of two unknown people when Justin was making every effort to hide her identity."
0,This was a grave mistake caused by the harsh training and conditioning her father forced upon her.
0,Would Justin be angry?
0,Would he scold her?
0,"If word spread that she was capable of magic in a world that supposedly had no magic, she would draw undesired attention, and that would trouble her rescuer."
0,"And worse, in the rare chance that the assassin did arrive in this world, he would be able to locate her much easier."
0,She could no longer rely on the instincts engrained in her since childhood.
0,They were detrimental to her survival on this world.
0,"In addition to learning English and meditating to become accustomed to the strange ven, she now had to actively repress her training."
0,Eydis turned to the woman still standing in the foyer with these worries spiraling in her mind.
0,"The short woman bounded in front of Eydis with pure excitement lit like a spark in her eyes, now looking more like the young girl she had initially assumed."
0,“Was that some kind of Chinese one-inch-punch?
0,That was incredible!”
0,Eydis thought for a moment but could not make any sense of what she said.
0,"If she could do nothing about the man who saw her use magic, she could at least find out who he was and inform Justin with an apology and promise to be more careful."
0,“Who was he?” Eydis asked.
0,"“A mistake,” the short woman replied."
0,“He is Mistake?”
0,"“He asked me on a date last night, and I went."
0,"It was a very nice restaurant, and I immediately knew what he was after."
0,"I asked him to take me home right afterwards, but he wanted me to come back to his place."
0,I said no.
0,Then he had the gall to go after me in his own car!
0,God… Why do men think that you can buy sex with dinner?
0,Every guy I meet either thinks hello means I’m wet and ready or dates me forever without ever wanting sex.
0,There is no in-between!”
0,Eydis stood in silence.
0,"Again, she could not make sense of her."
0,"“Oh, I’m sorry."
0,"You don’t speak English, do you.”"
0,Eydis paused to string together a simple reply.
0,"“I do not speak English good… no, well?”"
0,“Where are you from?” 
0,"Again, Eydis thought carefully about her answer but not just because she had to figure out how to say it."
0,"She could not tell her she was from another world, and there was no Amelian Empire in this world."
0,There was only one answer she could give.
0,“I am from house of Justin Hapfeld.”
0,“Justin?” The girl’s eyes wandered around the foyer and lingered on the sofa.
0,Her expression grew rather irritated for a moment but then calmed down.
0,“Are you his sister?
0,"No, you are too tall, too old, and his sister obviously speaks English."
0,Don’t tell me you are his girlfriend.” The irritation returned.
0,"This woman seemed to know Justin, which was a cause for some relief, although the irritation in her expression was troubling."
0,Eydis felt it best to explain further and show Justin’s sincerity.
0,“Justin help me.”
0,"“God, of all people… Of course he would."
0,"And here of all places, too.” The irritation faded but not completely."
0,"“Well, at least you don’t have to worry about him trying to sleep with you."
0,"I dated him for a year, and he wouldn’t even spoon."
0,He still living with Sean?”
0,“Sean?
0,"Yes, house of Sean.”"
0,“Sean’s an ass.” 
0,"Eydis did not know what an ass was, but from her tone, it could not have been a positive moniker."
0,Eydis rekindled her conviction to do whatever she could to not break Sean’s terms for letting her stay in his home.
0,"“Hold on, isn’t that Justin’s sweater?"
0,And that is Sean’s coat.
0,Those are men’s jeans too.
0,Are they Sean’s?
0,What kind of situation are you in?”
0,Eydis grew nervous when the woman picked at her clothing stating the names of the owners.
0,She realized that Eydis did not understand her question and rephrased it in simple words.
0,“Why are you with Sean and Justin?”
0,Eydis could not tell the woman her situation.
0,"She may know Justin, but she was uninvolved."
0,"The woman did not look like she would accept Eydis’s plea to remain silent, especially because she was acquainted with Justin."
0,Eydis took a deep breath and was about to speak when another voice spoke first.
0,“Sammy?” 
0,It was Justin.
0,The woman named Sammy walked past Eydis into the hall and began firing questions.
0,“Who is this girl?
0,Why is she wearing you and Sean’s clothes?
0,Why is she staying at your apartment?
0,Why did she say you were helping her?”
0,"Justin stepped backwards from the barrage of questions from someone that was even shorter than him, but he was not cowering."
0,He grew a confident smile.
0,“She’s an elven princess who was sent to our world using teleportation magic in order to escape an assassin who murdered her family.”
0,"Eydis placed her hand on the woven cap, asking Justin with her eyes if she should take it off."
0,Justin shook his head lightly.
0,Sammy did not notice the exchange and grew more irritated.
0,“I’m being serious here!” she shouted.
0,Justin shrugged his shoulders and walked over to Eydis.
0,He asked to see her arm and pulled up her sleeve to reveal many long and crossing bruises on her forearm.
0,"Justin recited the explanation that he, Dr. Shuman, and Eydis had agreed upon."
0,“Eydis was brought into the country illegally in an abusive situation we don’t know the full details about.
0,She escaped and collapsed on the river path just outside my apartment.
0,I found her in the morning practically naked and almost frozen to death.
0,I took her in and warmed her up.
0,School faculty knows about the situation.
0,"We asked, but Eydis absolutely refuses to let us contact the police."
0,Happy?”
0,Sammy’s eyes widened.
0,“Was it sex trafficking or something?!
0,Is that what happened?” Sammy looked back and forth between Eydis and Justin.
0,“I already said we don’t know the full details.”
0,Sammy walked over to Eydis and grasped her hands.
0,“You poor thing.
0,"Whatever happened to you, you are safe with me!"
0,I’ll see if I can talk to my dorm manager to set you up with a bed.
0,"For now, you can share my bed."
0,"There is a limit of 3 days for visitors, but I’ll make something happen before then.”"
0,Sammy again spoke far too fast for Eydis to follow.
0,"Seeing Eydis’s confusion, Sammy slowed down."
0,“You. Stay. With. Me.” 
0,Eydis was surprised by Sammy’s offer.
0,“What is your work?”
0,“Where do I work?
0,I am a librarian at the university here.”
0,“Librarian?” Eydis was not familiar with the word.
0,Sammy turned to Justin.
0,Her brows narrowed in annoyance.
0,“What language does she speak?”
0,"“A lot of them, just none that I know."
0,Think central to northeast Europe.”
0,"“God, you are useless.” "
0,"While Justin and Sammy argued about how to explain the word Eydis did not know, Eydis pulled out a small dictionary Dr. Shuman gave her."
0,The book was little help.
0,"The word it used was a loan word of a different language than this Anglo-Saxon that Justin and Dr. Shuman claimed she spoke, or perhaps the language of the sprites was not entirely the same as what was once spoken on this world."
0,She was left to look up the other words in its description and piece the meaning together.
0,"When Eydis thought she had come to some understanding, Sammy pulled the book from Eydis’s hands."
0,"“This,” Sammy said, pointing at the book."
0,“Lots of this.”
0,Sammy worked in this school’s archives.
0,She was a bookkeeper.
0,Eydis felt she could not rely on her.
0,"Given Justin’s profession as an information broker, he would be accustomed to the dangers and risks of his profession."
0,"There was no doubt in Eydis’s mind that Justin had plans already set for defense, escape, and hiding if someone sought to silence him for the information he sold."
0,Justin also knew the truth of her situation and that powerful people were targeting her.
0,"There was little chance that the assassin could follow her to this world, but the possibility remained, however improbable it might be."
0,Someone who was used to such risks and had plans prepared for emergencies would provide far better shelter than an uninvolved bookkeeper who was unable to send away one man just moments before.
0,"Eydis was grateful for Sammy’s offer, but she could not accept."
0,“Sorry.
0,I stay at home of Justin.”
0,"“Wait, what?"
0,Is that what your question was about?
0,How can me working at a library make you decide to live with him?” Sammy noticed Eydis’s confusion.
0,“Whhyyyy?” 
0,Eydis knew Sammy was asking the reason for her decision.
0,She looked up the single word that would describe her situation.
0,“Danger.
0,Danger for Sammy.”
0,“Danger?
0,Are those sex trafficking tards still looking for you?
0,"I can see why you would worry about staying with another girl, and I admit I wouldn’t want to run into them either, but… Gahhhh!” Sammy ruffled her hand through her wavy hair."
0,“Fine.
0,"Sean won’t do anything to you, and his police connections might help, and I’m not even sure Justin has a penis, so you will probably be safe there, but I want you to stay in contact with me.” Sammy turned to Justin who looked troubled by something Sammy said."
0,"“She doesn’t have a phone, right?”"
0,“What do you think?” Justin replied.
0,“Okay.
0,Eydis was it?
0,Come with me.”
0,Sammy grabbed Eydis’s wrist and began pulling her down the hallway.
0,Eydis stopped before turning the corner and looked back at Justin.
0,"“Yes, you come too,” Sammy ordered."
0,“You are going to help me pay for everything.”
0,Justin ran to the other side of Eydis.
0,"“You aren’t seriously going to get her a phone, are you?” "
0,“How long have you known me?
0,What do you think?
0,Just think of it as me paying forward the favor.”
1,"* * *
Eydis was excited to ride on the bus again."
0,"There were far fewer people than there had been in the morning and the day before, so Eydis and her two companions each had seats in the center near the doors."
0,"The bus ride was far longer than the trip from the bridge to the university, and they got off at what looked like a large fortress, but like all the other grand structures of the city, it lacked any defensive fortifications."
0,The huge field surrounding it was paved and filled with those automated carriages except for a few lines of small trees sectioning off parts of the field.
0,"“What is this?” Eydis asked, unable to make sense of the massive structure."
0,“Have you never seen a mall before?
0,What kind of hole did they keep you in?
0,Please don’t tell me they captured you as a child and kept you hid away.”
0,Eydis resigned herself to being unable to understand Sammy’s quick speech until her proficiency with English improved.
0,"She turned to Justin with the hope that he might explain, but Justin only shook his head."
0,“Ignore her.”
0,Eydis did not know the word “ignore” and so stayed silent.
1,"Once inside, the purpose of the structure became clear."
0,Numerous stores lined the walls and showed their wares through crystal-clear glass.
0,The entire building was a covered market filled with extravagant shops selling exquisite items that even the nobility of the empire would pay fortunes to obtain.
0,Eydis wondered how someone of supposedly low class like Justin could afford to shop in such a marketplace.
0,The only possible reason Eydis could think of was Sammy who accompanied them.
0,"Sammy’s noble features aside, a bookkeeper was an educated profession, and to be one for a large institution of learning would imply that Sammy was at least middle class but probably merchant class."
0,"Her clothing was of a far higher quality than Justin’s, so Eydis felt her assumption was correct."
0,"They walked along the long hallway filled with plants, kiosks, and small shops with the merchants peddling wares to passing shoppers."
0,"On the sides, large banners and displays decorated the perfectly transparent glass."
0,"White and black golems modeled clothing merchandise in the windows, but on closer inspection, the golems were not real but fabrications made from some glossy material."
0,Eydis could not deny that the display figures looked uncannily similar to the delegates from the golem nation of Stollmuk along the empire’s eastern border.
0,"Golems could fashion their appearance however they pleased, but the delegates kept bipedal forms nearly identical to elves for ease of communication and interaction."
1,Sammy stopped at a smaller store with familiar hand-held communication devices on display.
0,She pulled Eydis inside and to one of the shop attendants.
0,"She then snagged the attendant by the sleeve and pulled him and Eydis over to a specific device, ordering him to retrieve it."
0,He returned a moment later and walked with them to the counter.
0,"The man displayed the usual tenacity of a peddler, but Sammy surprised Eydis by how well she controlled negotiations."
0,Definitely a merchant’s daughter.
0,"Soon Sammy pulled Justin in and made him pay for the device, screeching Eydis’s thoughts to a halt."
0,Why would Sammy force a lower class to pay?
0,Were these communication devices actually rather inexpensive?
0,Or was she abusing her superior social status?
1,“I can’t believe I had to buy it.
0,Wasn’t it your idea to get her a phone?” Justin moaned.
0,“She’s on my plan.
0,"You only made the down payment, but I’ll be getting the monthly bill."
0,"In the end, I’ll be paying more."
0,"Besides, it’s only until she gets herself situated."
0,You’ll make up for the difference by buying her clothes.”
0,“Clothes?” Justin stopped walking.
0,"“What, you don’t expect her to keep using you and Sean’s, do you?” Sammy stopped walking and turned to look with suspect at Eydis’s chest and hips."
0,“You said that she was practically naked.
0,I probably should ask.
0,Did she have any underwear?”
0,Justin stiffened.
0,"“No, she didn’t.”"
0,Sammy took two tense steps toward Justin with a scowl.
0,He recoiled slightly but did not move.
0,“Is she wearing any now?” Her eyes were daggers piercing into Justin’s moral center preventing him from lying.
0,"Justin shook his head, and Sammy punched him in the stomach."
0,Or she would have if Eydis had not reacted so quickly to catch Sammy’s hand before it hit.
0,Eydis did not understand the exchange.
0,She only understood that Sammy’s aggression grew quickly.
0,Sammy’s sudden attack surprised her.
0,"Her training instinct moved her arm, and she had to restrain herself to not repeat her mistake with “Mistake” and retaliate by instinct."
0,“Don’t you think that getting her something proper to wear would be the first thing you should do?
0,God!” Sammy ignored that Eydis had stopped her punch and grabbed her extended wrist.
0,“He’s such an idiot!” she spat.
1,She pulled Eydis down a few shops to an undergarment vendor.
0,The undergarments ranged from mildly titillating to blatantly seductive and caused blood to rush to Eydis’s cheeks.
0,"She was more than comfortable without any breast support, and she doubted that they would have any underskirts meant to conceal a tail."
0,"From the look of all the displays and the fake white and black golems that modeled the wares, the lower undergarments were tight fit and hid nothing."
0,Some of them were even transparent lace or so thin that the owner would be better off naked because somehow the teasing fabric felt even more erotic.
0,"Disregarding Eydis’s apprehensions, Sammy pulled her through the displays to an attendant."
0,“Can we do a bra fitting for her?”
0,They followed the attendant to a back room with multiple smaller booths that each had their own separate door.
0,Eydis and Sammy entered one while the attendant waited outside.
0,"Sammy ordered Eydis to remove her coat, sweater, and shirt."
0,Eydis followed Sammy’s instructions but took great care to not pull off her woven cap with the shirt to keep her ears hidden.
0,"Sammy grew silent, the sight before her robbing her of breath."
0,She slowly moved her hand towards one of the many bruises that were now larger and growing green and yellow in color.
0,"A finger hovered above the horrid mark but hesitated to touch, stopping just above the skin."
0,Sammy’s hand retracted slightly and attempted to touch again.
0,"The longer Sammy stared, the more her face contorted in distress."
0,"Her voice quivered, and angry tears welled in her eyes."
0,“Who would do such a thing?” 
0,Eydis knew how grave her injuries would appear to others.
0,"Such excessive bruising would incapacitate most, and she could only endure it during the assassination attempt due to her experience with her advancement matches which were often just as brutal, but now the actual damage was healed."
0,The bruising only looked severe.
0,She smiled and grabbed Sammy’s extended hand.
0,“I am no hurt.”
0,Eydis wiped a falling tear from Sammy’s cheek and urged Sammy to start measuring.
0,Sammy hesitated.
0,There was no way Eydis would not be hurting.
0,How could she not?
0,Sammy felt her own arm unconsciously as if imagining the pain such damage would cause her.
0,Her vexed expression hinted that she felt Eydis was only showing a strong front in an attempt to ease her worries.
0,Eydis gently grasped Sammy’s hand and moved it to one of the larger bruises that covered most of the top of her right breast to near her collarbone.
0,The bruise was as large as Sammy’s hand and would hurt terribly if touched had she not healed it three nights before.
0,"Sammy tried to retract her hand, but Eydis shook her head."
0,She applied pressure to Sammy’s hand atop the bruise and smiled.
0,"“No hurt,” she repeated."
0,"Sammy gently palpated some of the other bruises, and a tear fell from her eyes for each one she touched."
0,“Is everything alright?
0,Do you need any assistance?”
0,The voice of the attendant on the other side of the door reminded Sammy why they were there.
0,"Sammy nodded, wiped her face with her sleeve, and measured Eydis’s rib circumference and her breasts."
0,"Confirming with the attendant outside, they settled on a size."
0,“I’ll go retrieve a 32-B sample bra to confirm the match.”
0,"Upon the attendant’s return, Sammy had Eydis don the bra and confirmed the size."
0,Sammy spent the remaining time in the store finding bras that Eydis liked.
0,"She focused on sets that not only came with a matching bottom but multiple bottoms and bras, which was cheaper than selecting individual pairs."
0,"They were also nowhere near as provocative as those on display, much to Eydis’s relief."
0,"After picking out enough for daily use, Sammy paid for them."
0,Eydis returned to the booths to change into a pair.
0,"She had no choice but to wear the human style and let her tail hang over the back because when she tucked it inside, the underwear held it between her legs, and it would rub when she walked."
1,They returned to Justin who was sitting in a padded chair in the large corridor outside the shop.
0,Sammy walked directly to him.
0,"Her hands shook, and twice she tried to speak, but her voice fell silent."
0,She took a deep breath and collected herself.
0,“Her bruises… Have you seen her…” 
0,“As clearly as you likely did.
0,They were pretty bad when I found her.
0,They probably all happened the day before.”
0,Sammy’s hands tightened into fists.
0,"She stared into Justin’s reassuring eyes, but this only fueled her anger."
0,"“You know more about this than you are telling me, don’t you.”"
0,Justin’s eyes remained firm.
0,“I told you what I know.
0,It’ll be up to Eydis if she wants to tell you more.” He stood from his seat and walked over to Eydis.
0,“Let’s finish shopping.”
0,"Justin walked away, so Eydis quickly followed."
0,"Sammy hurried after them and jumped in front of Justin, forcing him to a halt."
0,"“Just so you know, you are paying for all her clothes because I got her underwear.” Sammy began walking but stopped after a few steps."
0,"“If I find out that you have been lying to me about any of this, I’ll kill you.”"
0,"“Noted,” Justin replied with a shrug."
0,"Sammy’s open hostility towards Justin worried Eydis, especially because she was of a higher social status, but Justin did not seem to reflect the same worry."
0,He shrugged it off with a shake of his head and a smile as if this kind of exchange was normal for them.
0,"From what Eydis could glean from Sammy’s earlier conversation, they had known each other for one of this world’s years, but Eydis could not pin down what the nature of their relationship could have been."
1,Eydis played around with the possibilities in her mind while she followed Justin and Sammy to a clothing vendor that specialized in tall and slender styles.
0,"Sammy ran with eager fervor from wall to wall, rack to rack, grabbing clothes that she assured would accentuate Eydis’s “natural beauty,” exclaiming that, “when you look great, you feel even better.” Soon Eydis had no time to worry over Justin, at least concerning Sammy’s hostility towards him."
0,A new worry quickly emerged.
0,Eydis had to stop Sammy from piling on more and more clothes for the sake of Justin’s purse.
0,"He had already done so much for her, and Eydis felt terrible that he was being made to pay even more for her support, especially with something as superficial as stylish clothing."
0,"She was more than happy wearing Sean and Justin’s extras, given her situation."
0,"Justin urged Eydis to follow Sammy so she could at least have some say in what she wore, but Eydis let Sammy make the selection and agreed to turn down anything that she did not care for."
0,She outright rejected warm tones as well as blacks and greys.
0,Eydis enjoyed the subtle blues and greens despite her family’s tendency to wear vibrant colors as a status symbol.
0,"She chuckled silently when inspecting a simple looking, bright purple, one-piece dress that Ceil, her father’s most recent wife, would have loved."
0,"Seeing Eydis’s reaction to the dress, Justin found the size Sammy had told him and added it to the pile of outfits for Eydis to try."
0,Sammy led Eydis to the entrance of a hallway filled with dressing rooms where they learned that there was a ten-item limit.
0,Over half the pile was handed to Justin who had to wait outside the hallway.
1,She received a large tag with the number ten on it from the attendant standing guard and pulled Eydis inside.
0,"Sammy urged Eydis to undress, but Eydis was apprehensive."
0,"She knew that Justin was trying to keep her elven identity hidden from Sammy, and if she undressed to her underwear, even if she could keep her woven cap on to hide her ears, the surrounding mirrors made hiding her tail impossible."
0,"“Please alone,” Eydis requested."
0,“You didn’t mind when you got measured for your underwear.
0,"And with me here, you won’t have to open the door every time to show me how it looks.”"
0,Sammy’s smile was radiant.
0,"Eydis did not know how to make her understand and could not understand Sammy’s reply well enough to offer a rebuttal, so she repeated her humble request."
0,"“Please alone, Sammy.”"
0,Sammy exhaled and then smiled.
0,“Okay.
0,No biggie.” She then left the small room and closed the door behind her.
0,Eydis locked the door in the same manner she saw Sammy lock it just moments before and undressed completely.
0,She had a full view of the bruises on her body in the surrounding mirrors.
0,"She had forgotten to erase the scars of the three small punctures from teleporting into the bush, so she took a moment to kill and replace the damaged skin using life magic."
0,The result was fresh and smooth skin that no longer bore a scar.
0,"It was pinker than the surrounding skin, but as the skin died naturally, the color would blend to match."
0,"Pleased with the results, Eydis picked out a set of blue pants made of thick fabric, a simple white shirt with a mildly pleated pattern in the front that even Eydis felt matched her modest chest well, and a light green blouse that Sammy claimed would look appealing if worn over the shirt."
0,"The shirt and blouse fit perfectly, but the pants were tight against her tail, causing quite a bit of discomfort."
0,"Sammy said she wanted to see the clothes, so Eydis placed on her woven cap, tucked her ears inside, and opened the door."
0,“That looks great!
0,"Turn around.” Sammy motioned her hand in a circle, so Eydis turned slowly."
0,"“Yup, looks good."
0,Everything fit okay?”
0,"Eydis’s tail ached from the pressure, so she tried pulling the back of her pants up so that they did not rest on her tail."
0,Sammy moved around to investigate the issue.
0,“Something seems bunched up here.
0,Hold on.”
0,"Before Eydis could stop Sammy, a strong pressure on her tail caused a tight pain in Eydis’s lower abdomen."
0,“Hii!”
0,“Wha?!”
0,Two voices screamed out in unison.
0,"Before Eydis could recover from the pain and shock that nearly made her knees buckle, Sammy pulled her into the changing room."
0,“What is that?
0,Do you have a tail?” Sammy’s voice was hushed so that others who may be in nearby stalls could not hear.
0,Eydis looked at the mirror on the door and saw in the reflection of the mirror behind her that Sammy had pulled her tail out of the pants.
0,"The smooth and hairless tail no thicker than two of her fingers hung down and rested in the crease of her cheeks, only extending a little below them."
0,"Eydis tried to hide it with her hands, but just as she thought, the surrounding mirrors made her efforts futile."
0,Sammy looked at the tail’s reflection and then into Eydis’s eyes.
0,"With a single quick motion, she pulled off the woven cap."
0,Eydis did not try to stop her.
0,What good would that do now?
0,"Released from their captor, Eydis’s pointed ears sprung out sideways."
0,"Looking at Eydis’s ears, then eyes, then ears again, Sammy dropped the hat and sat back onto the bench lining the mirror on her side."
0,“Are you an… an elf?” Sammy’s tone showed her disbelief in her own words.
0,Eydis’s ears drooped slightly.
0,“I am an elf.” 
0,"“No, it couldn’t be."
0,A princess?
0,Are you a princess?”
0,"“Yes, princess.” Eydis’s ears drooped lower."
0,“Then what Justin first said about you… Stay here.
0,Don’t go anywhere.”
0,Sammy left Eydis to wait in the room on the bench.
0,Eydis was angry at herself for letting her identity slip out because of her tail.
0,"The pain from her tail being pulled had not fully subsided, but instead of using life magic to alleviate the ache, Eydis let it remain as punishment for her own carelessness."
0,"She wished that she could freely flaunt her tail like men instead of keeping it hidden, but female tails were special."
0,"They contained far more nerves than male tails, and Eydis’s was very sensitive even when compared to other women."
0,"Symra always taught Eydis that her tail was one of her greatest weaknesses in combat, because whenever Symra would strike Eydis’s tail, Eydis would buckle."
0,"Eydis never expected it would also become detrimental to hiding her identity, because normally, it would never be seen."
0,"Female tails became even more sensitive during arousal which made them associated with sex, so elven society dictated that female tails should be kept hidden and only shown to one’s spouse."
0,Eydis never thought that her tail might be seen by another.
0,"Although, she would often let her tail hang out and play with it when no one was around, something that was viewed as inappropriate and childish."
0,"Living among others in a land where her identity should remain secret, her tail habits might become another danger to her identity."
0,The risk of her tail was something she had never considered.
0,At least she could think of this mistake with Sammy as a learning opportunity.
0,She rubbed the smooth skin of the tip of her tail in her depressed state while thinking about how she would apologize to Justin.
0,"Breathing deep, Eydis locked the door and donned the purple dress."
0,The comfort it provided far surpassed the pants she had tried before.
0,"Looking in the reflection behind her, the bulge of her tail was not visible."
0,Eydis suspected dresses were the only human clothing she would be able to wear with comfort.
0,"Skirts would have been nice, but she had not seen them when perusing the clothing."
0,She sat silently in the dress until Sammy returned.
0,"Eydis expected Sammy to come with more questions or accusations, but Sammy entered silently, grabbed all the pants, and then left again."
0,"After another span of time, she returned and locked herself inside the room with Eydis."
0,In Sammy’s arms were some more pants as well as the elusive skirts.
0,“I like that dress.”
0,Something was different in how Sammy spoke and acted.
0,Her words were slower and more cleanly pronounced.
0,"Her smile was still radiant, but instead of the heat of the noonday sun, it held the subtle warmth of a sunset."
0,"“But, it really conflicts with your golden hair."
0,"If you like it, that’s fine."
0,Try this on with the blouse you wore before.”
0,Sammy handed Eydis pants that looked nearly identical to the uncomfortable pair.
0,"Eydis no longer needed to hide her identity from Sammy, so she no longer had reservations about undressing in front of her, although she did feel a little self-conscious about Sammy staring at her tail."
0,Eydis’s tail was on the short side.
0,Most men preferred women with longer tails.
0,"Eydis understood that Sammy had no way of knowing this about elves due to there being no elves in this world, but she felt ashamed of her length just the same."
0,"When she told Sammy, Sammy only chuckled and said her tail was cute and not to worry."
0,"Humans normally did not have tails, so they wouldn’t care about length, but Sammy’s reply did little to comfort Eydis."
0,Eydis had felt inferior over her length ever since Ceil first started living at the palace.
0,Ceil’s was always far longer than Eydis’s despite Ceil being a year younger.
0,"Ceil also had two tails of perfectly even length, a sign of extreme fertility and luck among elves and so incredibly rare that there were only nine recorded cases of someone being born with this trait, the most recent being a little over 100 years ago."
0,"It was because of Ceil’s tails that Eydis’s father had taken such a young girl to wife, claiming her before anyone else could."
0,"The more Eydis thought about Ceil, the more she missed the close sister she had found in the girl and the more she hoped that Ceil had been able to escape."
0,"Eydis ceased her reminiscing, pulled up the pants, and tucked her tail inside."
0,The feeling was unlike the other pair.
0,They were soft and elastic.
0,"Instead of resting low on her hip and putting pressure on her tail, the elastic band on the top held at her waist."
0,The soft fabric hugged her tail like a blanket.
0,Eydis looked at Sammy with amazement.
0,“Sorry I hurt you.
0,"Your tail seemed sensitive, so I thought some jeggings would work."
0,I also got some skirts if they didn’t.” 
0,Eydis leaned forward and embraced Sammy.
0,“Thank you.”
0,Sammy separated and flashed her sunset smile.
0,“No need to thank me.
0,Now put on that blouse and let’s see how it looks together.”
0,Eydis tried on all the outfits that Sammy put together.
0,"Each of the so-called jeggings that Sammy brought was very comfortable, so Eydis opted for them over the skirts."
0,"The bump from her tail was slightly visible until her tail snuggled into the crease of her cheeks, but someone would only see it if they were looking directly at it, and her blouse covered the bump when standing."
0,"Sammy did not seem to think it would be an issue, so Eydis pushed the worry from her thoughts."
0,"Once finished, six full outfits were chosen with an extra skirt and shirt on the side."
0,"Eydis also selected three pairs of fleece sweatpants for sleepwear, fascinated by the soft fabric."
0,"When Sammy suggested shirts to go with them, Eydis declined."
0,She only wore her night skirt to bed in her world and would sleep better or at least more comfortably without.
0,"Sammy protested, but the language barrier complicated creating any sound argument that Eydis could fully agree with."
0,"In an unknown world and after all that happened, Eydis had trouble sleeping, so she wanted to be as comfortable as possible to hopefully alleviate the issue."
0,"And the fewer clothes she bought, the less Justin would have to pay."
0,"Given that reasoning, and knowing the truth about what happened to Eydis, Sammy finally conceded defeat."
0,"“Then make sure to put a shirt on whenever you leave your room,” Sammy ordered as she added the shirts to the ‘keep’ pile anyway."
0,Eydis apologized to Justin in her heart for the extra unnecessary expense.
0,"They placed the undesired clothing on the table at the entrance to the hallway, and Sammy thanked the attendant."
1,Justin sat on a bench off to the side seemingly deep in thought but stood and joined Eydis and Sammy once they exited.
0,Anxiety grew in Eydis’s stomach as they approached the register.
0,"She was about to say that she did not need the extra clothing, but then Sammy stood in front of Justin and paid for it all."
0,"“I just wanted that idiot to learn some responsibility and grow up a little,” Sammy admitted with a smile, “but he seems to be doing a lot for you already."
0,My family has lots of money anyway.”
0,Relief washed over Eydis.
0,"She took some pride in hearing that her assumption of the class difference between Sammy and Justin was correct, so Sammy paying would not weaken her purse."
0,"And Justin was providing for Eydis, so Eydis found that Sammy’s reasoning was honorable."
1,The last stop was the shoe store.
0,Sammy also paid for the two pairs of shoes.
0,The first was not unlike Justin’s pair that she was wearing called tennis shoes.
0,"The second resembled boots and had short heels, a must for winter according to Sammy."
0,Gullivan apparently received a lot of snow every year.
0,"“Now that shopping is done, let’s have dinner!” Sammy exclaimed."
1,Eydis followed Sammy and Justin to a large hall with tables in the center and food stalls lining the edges.
0,The single meal Eydis ate the day before had been enough to last her into this one.
0,"The food of this world was far denser and more filling than the food of her world, heavy enough to mildly upset her stomach."
0,"This time, Eydis wanted to try something much lighter, so she requested a simple salad."
0,"Sammy followed Eydis but ordered a salad with some type of grilled white meat on it, possibly avian."
0,Justin chose a salad wrapped in very thin flatbread and added the same meat.
0,"He then paid for all three meals before Sammy could, mildly annoying Sammy."
0,They found a table and ate as Sammy fiddled with Eydis’s smartphone and instructed Eydis how to use it.
0,"“Justin, have you seen this?” Sammy handed the phone over to Justin."
0,“It says some child got hit by a truck outside of town last night.
0,What’s weird is that a witness claims it was not a child but some tiny man.
0,A midget or something.”
0,Eydis wondered if she had heard correctly.
0,“Not a child?
0,Tiny man?” 
0,"From what Eydis had seen and heard from Dr. Shuman and Justin, minums did not exist in this world."

“The Start of the Hunt”
Jethro"
1,Jethro admired the view of the grand council chamber from in front of the throne of the former Amelian Emperor.
0,"The faint smell of blood lingered in the great hall, but the odor did not distract from the elegant tapestries and masonry that put to shame anything that Jethro had seen since his arrival in the Kingdom of Tolmyur."
0,"Like most of the palace, the walls were carved white marble with wood accents fashioned into natural geometry."
0,Tall crystalline windows rose in the back to light the hall with rainbow sparks from the sun.
0,Pillars rose along the sides of the hall’s length to support an upper balcony.
0,What he found odd about the orientation of the seating was that the emperor’s throne was the lowest seat in the hall.
0,The tiered council chairs that were finely crafted and unique to the needs and comfort of the individual races that used them sat on the balcony and looked down on the throne.
0,The slightly elevated platform for those seeking audience with the emperor or council stood at level with the throne itself.
0,Jethro could not understand how such a self-righteous emperor could bear sitting below those who served him or took audience with him.
0,"Then again, the elves were not the original architects of this palace."
0,"In the ancient ruins of the northern wilderlands, there were several halls with similar seating orientations."
0,"In truth, Jethro knew little about the internal dealings of the Amelian Empire’s government, its emperor, and its people."
0,What he did know came from the military and government officials of the Tolmyur Kingdom as well as historical documents preserved in Tolmyur’s archives.
0,"On the surface, the elves did not appear as the barbaric and ruthless race that the humans and records made them out to be, but the truth written in the records and what he had experienced personally was undeniable proof of their cold-hearted treachery, especially towards the humans."
0,The catastrophic state of the Tolmyur Kingdom was a topic close to Jethro’s heart.
0,He had lost much in his time there due to war and the terrible living conditions of the country.
0,One loss stacked on top of another leading him to devote himself completely to his military career.
0,Jethro proved to not only be far more educated than any of the officers but also far more skilled with magic than even the minums.
0,"After only half a year, he rose in ranks to the highest commanding office of the Tolmyur military, but only after he killed the former Commanding General who had tried to assassinate Jethro to stop his rapid rise to power."
0,"When the King awarded Jethro the position of Commanding General, he gave Jethro the task of improving their military might and granted Jethro’s request to let him finalize a generations-old plan to enact retribution upon the Amelian Empire."
0,Half a year of preparation led to the triumphant victory that gave Jethro the ability to stand in this hall.
0,The crushing defeat of the allied armies of the sovereign states of the Amelian Empire who tried to retake Amel had crippled many of the races’ military power.
0,Jethro did not doubt he would win.
0,The Amelian Empire was far inferior to his knowledge.
0,There was no challenge.
0,"Instead, the battle was orchestrated as a display of power designed specifically to terrorize the hearts of every sovereign state allied under the empire’s banner."
0,None would dare retaliate for fear of leaving their home territories defenseless.
0,"Jethro could strike instantly anywhere at any time, and now all nations feared that power."
0,The victory had only cost the Tolmyur Kingdom a small percent of their total army.
0,The king was so pleased with Jethro’s success that he granted him nobility and charge over Amel.
0,“Pleased…”
0,Jethro could only smile to himself.
0,"When personally giving the report of the victory to the King, masked in the high praise and jovial demeanor Jethro saw the same animosity that the former Commanding General had shown."
0,Giving Jethro charge over land in the center of enemy territory was an obvious attempt to keep him away.
0,"Yes, even the King of Tolmyur now feared him."
0,But Jethro did not care.
0,What the King thought of him was a trivial matter that did nothing more than distract him from the task at hand.
0,"Even if the king wanted to target Jethro, he lacked the means to threaten him."
0,"Jethro was the strongest in the kingdom, and he no longer had any family that the king could target."
0,Jethro sat on the throne with both arms and legs crossed in a rather lazy fashion unbefitting someone of his status.
0,Trying to control the rowdy resistances scattered all over the territory provided some entertainment.
0,Witnessing the demoralizing one-sided defeat within the streets of their own capital had doused the fires of resistance in Amel before it could spread.
0,All that was left was to bury the embers.
0,Those who still clung to hope spoke of the survival of the royal family.
0,They claimed the royal bloodline had not ended.
0,"Were these humans and not elves, Jethro would have understood the concept of cousins or other distant relatives of the emperor being able to inherit the throne, but for elves, only the spouses and children could inherit."
0,This was a product of elven longevity and inter-breeding.
0,"Living as long as elves do, there was ample time to produce offspring who also lived long lives."
0,"With such enormous families whose children married into many other families, most elves were rather closely related."
0,This interconnectedness was even stronger in the pure-breed High Elves that held claim to the throne of the empire.
0,"The royal bloodline was considered the purest of all, and most High Elves had some royal blood in them by human familial standards."
0,"Once an emperor was crowned, the brothers and sisters were relegated to nothing more than nobility with no connection to the throne."
0,"For the resistance to say that the royal bloodline had survived, there were only two possibilities: they believed that the missing princess was still alive, or they spoke of the one wife of the emperor who had escaped."
0,"True enough, Jethro had been unable to present to the masses the corpse of the princess or the wife as he had the rest of the royal family."
0,"In such dire times, no evidence meant there was hope."
0,"If Jethro wanted to seal the fate of the empire and stamp out the remaining resistance, he needed to remove both these obstacles, especially if the surviving wife was with child."
0,"The whereabouts of the escaped wife was unknown, but Jethro was sure she was being protected in one of the many nations within the empire."
0,The first princess hiding in another world was a far more difficult--and personal--matter.
1,Jethro removed a pocket watch from his coat.
0,"Confirming the time, he opened the black portal that gave access to the mysterious world hiding the first princess."
0,No sooner had the portal opened than a man wearing a crude traveler’s robe appeared.
0,In his hand was an identical pocket watch.
0,"“You were wise to send this with me,” the freckled and disheveled scout spoke."
0,“The days pass far faster there.
0,"Without this, I would not have known when to wait.”"
0,“Were you able to contact Kimmel?” 
0,Jethro had suspected something was amiss when Kimmel did not return through the portal Jethro made at the agreed time.
0,"Of the possible reasons, difference in time was one that Jethro had personally experienced."
0,"Providing the pocket watch he found in the palace, the first of any kind of watch he had seen in all the wilderlands, Tolmyur, and Amel, was a countermeasure for this."
0,"“Regrettably, I could not find him."
0,"There is a possibility he was captured or killed,” the scout replied."
0,“Are the inhabitants hostile?” 
0,Dangerous inhabitants were a double-edged sword.
0,"While his goal was the death of the princess, something that the inhabitants of the other world could accomplish unknowingly for him, he would need her body as proof, or the resistance would not believe him."
0,"“The inhabitants were the most peculiar part,” the scout continued."
0,“They were all sotnum.
0,"Not minum, doknum, or seknum."
0,Just sotnum.”
0,“Not surprising.
0,"There are also humans here, after all.”"
0,“Sir?” 
0,“Continue.” 
0,“I was able to freely walk among them in their city.
0,"They saw me as a foreigner due to my dress and language, but most were kind and gave me no trouble.”"
0,“What of the princess?” 
0,“No sign of her.
0,The city is vast and has a large population.
0,"I feel that only one or two scouts would be insufficient to locate her, especially when we do not know the language.”"
0,"“If they are human, we may be able to convince one to help."
0,Does their language seem difficult?”
0,The scout removed a scrap of flimsy grey paper with black lettering and handed it to Jethro.
0,"Jethro scanned it over but could not make any sense of it, as expected."
0,"While auditory language translated automatically within his mind, written forms were left to his own study to interpret."
0,“Did you glean any phrases from what you heard?
0,How does their language sound?”
0,“Pronunciation did not seem as complex as common Minum nor was it as simple as Elven.” 
0,‘Ifhee complainstoomee won moor time aimgonnasnap.’ 
0,‘Oh god heeneedza bath.’
0,‘No you havta waiduntil weget home.’ 
0,"“Do you need more, sir?” the scout asked after he saw Jethro’s brow knot further for every line that he repeated from what he heard in that world."
0,"“No, that is enough.” Jethro rubbed his chin."
0,High-ranked scouts were trained to echo what they heard in order to pass along information even if they did not know the language.
0,"Jethro trusted that his scout was not far off in his pronunciation, but it did not translate in his mind."
0,It seemed his gift only extended to languages on Whinhlem.
0,"Jethro reached into the space beside him, his hand vanishing through a small vertical crack in the air."
0,"He removed a small piece of parchment, a quill, a thin corked vial, and a small bag of sand."
0,"Uncorking the vial, he dipped the quill in the ink and penned a message."
0,"After spreading sand on the ink to speed the drying so it would not run, the message disappeared with a light pop."
0,"A minute later, he opened a portal, and a second scout walked through."
0,"This scout was short and of a thick build, a dwarf with a refined posture befitting his leadership position as scout captain."
0,"“Mordok, I would like you two to find someone educated."
0,"Male or female, it does not matter."
0,"If we can find someone who can either learn our language or teach us the language of that world, our search will become easier."
0,Feel free to promise any reward they ask if it is within my power to grant.
0,I will open the portal for your return in nine days.”
0,"“About the portal,” the first scout cut in, “can we move it to a different location?"
0,The exit is on a paved road.
0,"It is far from the city, but it is regularly traveled."
0,My sudden disappearance may have been witnessed.”
0,Jethro searched through the formula in his mind and reactivated the section regarding destination randomization but modified the restrictions so that the destination would remain near the city.
0,"He then opened the black portal and had the scout enter, return and report, and then enter a new portal."
0,"This repeated multiple times, and Jethro was quickly running low on ven."
0,"Finally, the scout returned with an elderly man in his arms, a human, as the scout had said."
0,This was indeed another world of humans.
0,The man’s neck was freshly cut and bleeding.
0,"The scout dumped him on the floor, and after flipping the knife around in his hand, he wiped the red stain off on his robe as he spoke."
0,“It was a residence separate from the main city.
0,The only occupant was this man.
0,I think this location is optimal.”
0,Jethro memorized the newly modified trace.
0,He then wrote out another three messages and sent them out with light pops.
0,"After waiting a moment, he opened up three more portals."
0,The demeanor of the three men differed from the two scouts.
0,These were soldiers trained for covert work and assassination.
0,Two were human and the third was a young minum.
0,"Each bore stern expressions in anticipation of their orders, having already been informed of and awaiting their possible mission to some unknown, strange world."
0,“You three will be sent to the other world to continue looking for the princess.
0,"Because the inhabitants are human, sotnum, do what you must to blend in with the population and gather information on all government, management, and city security facilities."
0,"Fect, because there are no minums in that world, stay hidden and observe."
0,There will likely be places you can go that the others cannot.
0,Use your high sensitivity to spatial ven to try and detect when the princess might use spatial magic.
0,"You have no time limit, and I will not contact you directly."
0,Leave a message with those at the portal exit if you must contact me.”
0,"Once the men had their orders, Jethro opened the black portal and sent them through."
0,Jethro then vanished with the sound of a loud snap.
0,There was a princess to entertain.
0,"Now that the hunt in the other world had moved to the next stage, he needed to refine the weapon the emperor had left him so that she too might join the hunt."
0,"Chapter 9
“Lesson Preparations”
Eydis"
1,"Not long after capture, one of Eydis’s suspicions was answered."
0,Larger rooms than her quarters in the east wing did exist.
0,"Instead of confining Eydis in some guard post’s dungeon, Jethro reserved the grandest of the guest rooms in the second-floor west wing of the palace for her, twice the size of her former accommodations that her father, the emperor, forbade her from leaving."
0,"The spacious, carpeted room functioned as a bed chamber, study, and a furnished lounge all combined into a single room."
0,The floral furniture was extravagant and unspoiled from the fighting that had emptied the palace.
0,Here Jethro met with her daily to discuss the nature of her imprisonment and the treatment of her people within and without the city.
0,"Other than the scheduled meetings, she had freedom to do what she wanted, aside from leave the room."
0,Again.
0,"Strangely, though, her accommodations in this room provided by Jethro were better than what her father had given her."
0,She only lacked servants.
0,"She dearly missed the maid who woke her every morning, the chef staff who brough her meals, her elderly instructor who enjoyed battling Eydis in contests of wit, and the guards who would engage her with light banter from the other side of her door whenever she felt the urge."
0,"Despite the grander accommodations, Eydis felt more isolated, lonely."
0,"Even though Jethro visited her daily, she found no joy in his company."
0,"He was her captor, and although he promised not to raze the city and to spare the citizens from slaughter, she knew they suffered greatly from the Tolmyur occupation."
0,"But that was her agreement, to stay slaughter in return for her cooperation."
0,Jethro never went back on his word.
0,That was something she learned quickly about him during his daily visits.
0,Never once in their hours of discussion did he lie.
0,"Despite how busy she assumed he was as Commanding General of Tolmyur, he made the time for her."
0,He brought her meals when they talked.
0,He resupplied her provisions as needed with his spatial magic.
0,He was her only contact.
0,No one else was permitted to see her.
0,"When she questioned his teleportation magic, he spent an entire day to teach her how to create standard teleportation formulas and shortcut the reading of teleportation traces with the warning that she would be unable to escape the teleportation barrier he placed around her room."
0,Only he held the key to the encryption.
0,"Other than her imprisonment, Jethro treated her exceptionally well, and she knew why."
0,"He was trying to gain her favor, and the realization sickened her."
0,"He wanted her cooperation, and her people were hostages to that end."
0,How could she ever think to cooperate with the man who butchered her people?
0,"The more Eydis dwelled on this, the more she began to loath their meetings."
0,She watched the sun move in the sky from her window and counted down the time until Jethro’s scheduled appearance.
0,Her feet felt heavy as she walked to the floral-stitched sofa of the lounge as if thick shackles bound her ankles.
0,"She sat and waited, a little longer than usual."
1,Jethro appeared in a flash of light beside the settee across from her.
0,"“Sorry to keep you waiting, Princess Eydis FeAmel.” "
0,He took a seat on the settee beside him and opened a small portal.
0,He pulled out two plain ceramic cups and saucers and then retrieved a similarly plain kettle piping hot with tea.
0,“I apologize that this is all I have to offer at the moment.
0,I was held up with planning and did not have time to run by the kitchen before coming here.
0,I am a poor host.” Jethro smirked.
0,He filled Eydis’s cup and handed it to her.
0,“Hosting me in my own palace?
0,What a farce.” Eydis replied.
0,"“But it is my palace now, correct?”"
0,Eydis closed her eyes with mild irritation.
0,She rested the cup and saucer on her lap and crossed one foot behind the other in a minor expression of humility as a woman who was a formal guest in another’s home.
0,“Indeed.” 
0,"Each visit, Eydis’s posture reverted from a subservient guest to the upright, straight posture of a host presenting herself before a guest of lower status."
0,Each visit Jethro subtly reminded her she no longer held the same status she once had.
0,"She could do little against him, so the gesture was her sole rebellion."
0,Eydis took a sip of the murky brown liquid.
0,Its strong bitter flavor left her coughing.
0,"This was the first time he had given her such a drink, and it was foul."
0,Jethro poured his own cup and took a long draft.
0,“Not to your liking?
0,"It took me forever to copy the taste, but it is still a little off."
0,"The beans I want can’t be found, it seems."
0,At least the palace stores have a bark with a similar flavor.
0,"I am quite proud of the discovery, actually.”"
0,"Not wanting to insult her host, Eydis continued drinking the hot, bitter liquid."
0,"The saucers were small, so etiquette demanded she empty the cup once at her own pace, and then her host would pour a second."
0,"Discussions would then continue, and she could decide whether to continue drinking, but a single sip of the second cup was usually taken out of gratitude for the host’s hospitality, even if she had no further desire to partake."
0,The speed in which she drained her first cup showed her desire to end their meeting quickly.
0,Her brooding at the window before Jethro’s arrival left her with little patience for him.
0,"When she finished, tears budding in the corners of her eyes from the immense effort required to keep a refined expression after downing such a bitter drink, Jethro retrieved the cup and saucer."
0,"Opening another small portal, he removed a different pitcher and poured its contents into the cup before handing it back."
0,Eydis was about to take a light sip out of courtesy but wretched at the smell.
0,"She looked at the contents and dropped the cup on the white carpet, staining it dark red."
0,“So it seems that you are far enough along that only the princess’s blood would be appetizing.
0,Perfect.” A crooked grin grew across Jethro’s face.
0,Eydis stood and backed away from the red stain.
0,“You insult me!
0,"What is the meaning of this?” Considering the comfortable treatment Jethro had given her, she never expected that he would so suddenly try and trick her into drinking blood."
0,Where did the blood come from?
0,A shiver ran down her spine.
0,Who did the blood come from?
0,“Just a test.
0,"I hope you will not take offence.” Jethro picked up the cup and saucer, and using a barrier that only rejected blood, he pulled the stain from the carpet and placed it back in the cup."
0,The carpet returned to its pristine white with no signs of any blood having been spilt.
0,"At Jethro’s coaxing, Eydis sat back down."
0,“That was a foul trick.
0,I hope you are satisfied.” Eydis crossed her arms and glared in irritation.
0,“Is this what passes as entertainment in that barbaric kingdom of yours?”
0,"“While your reaction was better than I expected, the real entertainment is yet to come, but some preparations must be made first.”"
0,Eydis grew wary of what Jethro was insinuating.
0,“What do you mean?”
0,"Jethro sat the cups, saucers, and pitchers on the small table beside his settee."
0,"“Do you believe you are the First Princess?” he asked, leaning forward with his hands clasped and elbows resting atop his knees."
0,Eydis’s eyes narrowed in an accusatory glare.
0,"“You were only allowed to stay in the lower levels in the southeast wing of the palace and could never visit the halls, council, or any of the upper floors."
0,Is that true?”
0,“The princess is not to reveal herself until she is wed or is crowned the new empress.
0,"Even your barbaric country should know this,” Eydis replied, knowing well that it was a lie."
0,"Her father ordered her confined to her room, but she did not know the true reason."
0,"“I still lived in luxury, had servants wait on me, and received proper education befitting nobility as one who would live by presenting herself in front of others, that is, until you besieged the palace.”"
0,“Education in keeping a royal appearance.” Jethro’s crooked grin grew wider.
0,"“Among others,” Eydis retorted quickly."
0,“I would have you know there is one vital piece of information that was neglected in your education.”
0,"Truth, Eydis’s senses told her."
0,"“Obviously there is much in the world that I have yet to learn and much more that I have no need to learn,” Eydis replied quickly, mirroring what her past instructor often stated to silence some of her piercing questions."
0,“What I am referring to affects you directly and is something your caretakers did not wish for you to know.
0,And it is most likely the reason you were confined to your room.” 
0,Truth.
0,Jethro retrieved a small burlap bag from a portal.
0,“Open it.”
0,Eydis loosed the string and removed a small jar.
0,"Inside sat a blood-colored, leach-like creature about the size of her hand."
0,It pulsated slightly but appeared almost dead.
0,“What is this?” 
0,Eydis brought the jar to her face to examine it closer.
0,The leach took notice and attacked the side of the jar facing Eydis.
0,"Eydis startled and dropped the jar on the floor, but it was sturdy enough to remain intact."
0,She picked up the rattled creature and inspected it again.
0,Its circular mouth filled with rows of tiny spined teeth scraped at the side of the glass near her face.
0,The creature soon lost energy and rolled back onto the bottom of the jar.
0,“I would like you to take care of that.
0,Think of it as a pet.” 
0,Jethro walked over to the wall on the far side from Eydis’s bed and created a portal on the floor.
0,"When he pulled it upwards, a metal crate large enough to fit a person appeared."
0,It lacked any windows with the only visible openings being a small latch door on the top and an even smaller metal funnel in one corner.
0,“Place it in here.”
0,Eydis continued observing the odd creature while she walked over.
0,Jethro opened the latch.
0,She unstopped the jar and shook out the leach into the large crate.
0,"The latch was then closed and the metal around the latch heated, welding the latch to the crate."
0,This surprised Eydis.
0,"Objects could be infused with magic, but she had never seen an infusion with an activation trigger."
0,She did not know such magic was possible.
0,Jethro retrieved the cup of blood and poured it into the funnel.
0,“I will place a similar cup on your bedside table each morning.
0,All you need to do is pour it in as I have and return the cup to the table.
0,"I have affixed a detection barrier on the surface, so I will know when you place something on it.”"
0,Eydis looked at the bloody cup in Jethro’s hand with disgust.
0,“How long must I care for this thing?” 
0,"“Twenty, maybe thirty days."
0,Leave a message with the cup if you have any concerns.
0,"Remember, there is something very important that you need to know, and taking care of this creature is the best way to teach you.”"
0,Another truth.
0,Jethro held the cup out to Eydis.
0,"After a moment of hesitation, she grabbed it."
0,“I will be upfront that I do not trust you.
0,"However, if this secret affects me, as future empress I will go through with it.”"
0,"“You are wise to do so, but you should abandon becoming empress.” "
0,Jethro’s jovial tone only served to increase the suspicion in Eydis’s glare.
0,“One more thing before I leave.
0,"In a few days, it will likely start making noises or rattle in its cage."
0,Pay it no mind.
0,Just feed it as instructed.”
0,"Jethro vanished in a loud snap, a different, more advanced form of teleportation than what he taught her, one that lacked the need for a physical portal."
0,Eydis was left staring at the crate with a bloody cup in her hands.
0,"Chapter 10
“Crossing Paths”
Austin"
1,"There was something bewitching about her beauty, something otherworldly that Austin found difficult to place into words."
0,"She was taller than most, even taller than Rebecca and possibly a little taller than him."
0,"She was also thinner than most, but not anorexic like Suzie."
0,"The first day he saw her, she wore baggy clothing like Kaitlyn."
0,Men’s clothing.
0,"But now she wore fitted clothes that proclaimed her femininity to all, femininity that Austin wanted to be revealed to him alone."
0,"Her hair was too golden to be called blond, and if it had a brilliant sheen, he would not doubt that it was truly made of gold."
0,"More golden than Amy, or even Chrystal whom Austin was convinced dyed her hair to retain such a tone."
0,But most bewitching of all was her eyes.
0,They were a deep sea-green and shone with authority that knew from the very core of her being that she was superior to all.
0,She glared at him with those eyes on that day.
0,"She made him feel beneath her, and that only made him want her more."
0,"Amy and Vanessa flaunted that same aura of superiority, but like all the others they sung his tune before long."
0,Amy in particular turned into a submissive moaning kitten after only a little foreplay.
0,"Austin wanted to tame that superiority, to prove to both her and himself that he was the superior one."
0,Sammy slipped through his fingers as if she had a sixth sense against his coercion.
0,There were a few like Sammy in the past--he never cared to remember their names--but he would not let that happen again.
0,Not with her.
0,Eydis FeAmel.
0,He would claim her for himself.
1,The bus jolted.
0,"A hip slammed into Austin’s shoulder as he sat on the padded seat by the bus’s folding door, jostling his mind away from admiration of his mental image of Eydis."
0,"The morning buses were always crowded, and normally he would not mind, but Austin’s frustration leaked into a faint scowl."
0,The bus was far more crowded than he expected.
0,"A crowded bus was beneficial, because it meant that people who were packed next to each other could not easily separate."
0,"He could strike a conversation with Eydis, and her only choices were to reply or ignore, but Eydis was too kind to ignore him."
0,"She was learning English and was more than happy to talk with anyone, even him after he apologized for what happened the day they met, prompting a quick and heartfelt apology from her for pushing him."
0,"If the bus was too crowded, people could stand between, complicating any conversation he would initiate."
0,"At least by catching Eydis on her morning commute to campus, Sammy would not be there to interfere again."
0,"“Next stop, Main Street Bridge,” the electronic voice announced, muffled by the mass of bodies and the sound of grinding asphalt."
0,Austin learned yesterday that Eydis lived in a small apartment half a mile or so south of the bridge on the east side of the river.
0,"She lived with another man, but their relationship did not appear to be romantic."
0,"They acted as no more than acquaintances, lacking even the most basic signs of platonic affection."
0,"Even if that was her boyfriend, Austin wasn’t worried."
0,"Vanessa also had a boyfriend, as did Karen."
0,"Austin was confident that if he asked any girl to pick between him and that man of short stature with some excess weight, she would pick him, but he was not so foolish to believe that appearance was all that mattered in attraction or that all women viewed physical attraction the same."
0,"The bus merged to the right lane and slowed, shifting the mass of bodies forward like reeds in light wind."
0,"Austin peered out the window beside him and saw few people at the stop, relieving some of his worry."
0,Eydis stood out towering over the other four who awaited the bus.
0,She and her friend or roommate or lover stood in the back of the group.
0,"They would board last, placing them by the door next to him."
0,The bus was crowded.
0,There was nowhere else to stand.
0,"Only three passengers exited the bus, creating a net gain in the already crowded space."
0,Eydis boarded last so that she could stare out the window as the bus moved.
0,"She tended to be fascinated by such simple things, which was rather charming."
0,A small smile grew across her lips when the bus pulled away from the curb back into morning traffic.
0,"“You must really like busses,” Austin said, tapping Eydis lightly on the leg by her knee."
0,Eydis started in surprise and looked down beside her.
0,"“Austin?” She had initially thought his name was “Mistake,” something that was likely Sammy’s doing to mock him."
0,"Eydis’s embarrassment when he told her his real name was adorable, so in truth he was a bit thankful to Sammy."
0,“Good morning.”
0,"“Good morning,” Eydis replied with a smile less authentic than when she gazed out the window."
0,Her friend seemed far less pleased to see him but did not speak up.
0,"Instead, he shifted Eydis around in the crowded space, swapping places with her with his back facing Austin."
0,"“I was just saying hello,” Austin replied to the wordless rejection, but he found it almost comical."
0,The man blocked nothing.
0,Eydis was tall enough and the man short enough that Austin could see Eydis’s face over his shoulder.
0,"Austin could continue the conversation if he wanted, but that would make him appear too desperate."
0,"Eydis’s expression was mildly apologetic, so clearly, she understood that her friend was in the wrong for overreacting to a simple greeting."
0,"Austin smiled back and shook his head, expressing his own disappointment at the overreaction."
0,"He would let it go, showing his goodwill."
0,"Sammy was acquainted with Eydis because of the incident on the day they met, and Austin admitted that it was not the best first impression of him."
0,Sammy would have cautioned Eydis against him and likely cautioned Eydis’s roommate.
0,He would not be able to conquer Eydis quickly.
0,"He needed to plan for the “long game,” to show her that whatever warnings Sammy may have spewed were baseless."
0,"As Eydis’s opinion of him improved, he would plant seeds of frustration about her friends’ continued distrust in him."
0,"The moment Eydis agreed to meet without either of her friends present, he would win."
0,Austin relaxed into his seat for the remainder of the ride to campus.
0,"He did not have class today, so mild frustration lingered from his inability to converse with Eydis, the sole reason he left early to travel to the other side of the city and catch a bus he never rode."
1,He exited the bus at the same stop as Eydis and was about to wave goodbye to her when Justin pulled him aside.
0,"Eydis stood a short distance off, well within earshot."
0,"“I know what you are doing,” he said in a stern tone."
0,“Stop.”
0,“Aren’t you overreacting a bit?
0,All I said was good morning.”
0,“Sammy told me you ran into her again yesterday.
0,"I have never seen you take the E-14 bus to campus at this time before, so it couldn’t have been a coincidence."
0,I wouldn’t have a problem if you didn’t already try to rape Sammy.”
0,“Is that what she told you?” Austin sighed.
0,“I tried to give her a kiss goodbye after our date.
0,That’s all.”
0,“She said it was far more than a kiss.”
0,“I’ve seen how Sammy treats you.
0,Can you really trust what she says?
0,"Honestly, I probably dodged a bullet with her.”"
0,The man’s brow knotted.
0,“Sammy was my girlfriend for about a year.
0,I know her far better than you think.
0,She would never lie about something like that.”
0,"“So you were the one she was complaining about during dinner,” Austin jeered."
0,"“Justin, your work,” Eydis said from her position a couple yards away."
0,"“I can keep you company while Justin’s at work,” Austin suggested with a smile."
0,"“Eydis has her English class, and Sammy will be with her until I’m off work."
0,Give it up.”
0,“Aren’t you suffocating her a bit too much?
0,Don’t tell me you are the obsessive controlling type.” Austin grimaced ruefully at Eydis.
0,“You deserve better than that.”
0,"“We have our reasons,” Justin replied without even attempting to refute the accusation."
0,"“Sorry, Austin."
0,Justin is true… correct?
0,"Justin is correct,” Eydis said as they walked away from the bus stop."
1,Austin groaned once Eydis and Justin were out of earshot.
0,"He admitted that he knew nothing about Eydis’s situation, and he was trying to learn more, but what frustrated him most was that Justin appeared to be in complete control over her."
0,And he was with Sammy for a whole year?
0,What was it about Justin that drew in that pissy rich girl and now drew in Eydis?
0,Both girls far outclassed him.
0,"If Austin wanted to conquer Eydis, he would need to break Justin’s control."
0,He knew how difficult that would be because he had used similar tactics on Suzie and Emma in the past.
0,"Is the effort even worth the reward, Austin thought to himself as he paced aimlessly down the sidewalk bordering the campus."
0,There were certainly benefits.
0,A girl broken by a controlling relationship can easily fall into someone’s control again.
0,They are groomed into that relational hierarchy and obey it out of habit or instinct or fear.
0,"If he could pull Eydis away from Justin, she certainly could be his if he exploited that dynamic."
0,“But how long?” he mumbled.
0,"The “long game” usually only lasted a few weeks, but in Eydis’s case it could be months or possibly a year before he could pull her away unless he got lucky."
0,"Eydis was certainly the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, but that was a long time to devote to nothing more than his current infatuation."
0,He would grow tired of her eventually like he had all the others.
0,His experience with Vanessa came to mind.
0,“I could just make her…” he began mumbling to himself.
0,"So long as he made Eydis feel good by the end, she wouldn’t mind how rough he was at the start."
0,"He could even use Justin’s controlling personality against her to keep her silent about it, but he had never once seen her alone."
0,Either Sammy or Justin always accompanied Eydis.
0,And that would only work if Eydis was actually in an abusive relationship with Justin.
0,Eydis showed signs of mental and emotional trauma.
0,"The signs were well hidden, but Austin was perceptive to these things."
0,"When smiling or apologizing, the ever-present aura of authority in her eyes collapsed, shaded by some unspoken darkness."
0,"That was leverage he could use, increasing the plausibility of the plan, but one major hurdle remained."
0,"Even if he could keep her silent, there was still the question of if he could restrain her long enough for her to submit to his skill."
0,"Vanessa was weak, so she was easy."
0,"Despite Eydis’s frail appearance, she was incredibly strong."
0,"That push she gave him the day they met was almost unnatural, and the stance she held when she pushed him was practiced."
0,That decided it.
0,"“I give up,” Austin chuckled to himself."
0,One girl was simply not worth that much trouble.
0,"He could admire her from a distance, and if the dynamic changed at any point, he could swoop in and take advantage of the opening, but until then there was no need to make her a priority."
0,"There are plenty of other girls out there, he thought to himself as he eyed the university girls walking towards campus on the other side of the road."
0,"None of them were as beautiful as Eydis, but his reward would come much quicker with them."
1,"He noticed a pair of girls being accosted by a short, bearded man in a cloak."
0,"They were younger, possibly freshmen."
0,"Freshmen were always eager to see the nightlife of a city new to them, and if he played them right, perhaps he could gain twice the reward or even both girls at once."
0,"He had never succeeded at a threesome, each attempt a horrible disaster, but it was always worth another shot."
0,Austin waved down an approaching car to stop and crossed the road.
0,The bearded man eagerly tried to converse with the two girls but was gaining no ground.
0,"Not only was his apparel strange, but as Austin neared, he could hear the man struggling to string words together into English."
0,The man was most likely a refugee.
0,"Gullivan had advertised itself as a refugee sanctuary, so the number of these types had increased in the past year."
0,"Austin considered the possibility that Eydis was one of them, but for all he knew she could have just been an international student."
0,"Actually, that was far more likely."
0,Austin shook his head.
0,He caught his mind lingering on Eydis instead of his new targets.
0,“Do you need help with something?” Austin asked as he approached from behind the girls.
0,"“Thank God,” the brunette on the left exclaimed, exasperated."
0,“Can you help him?
0,I think he might be lost or something.
0,"We need to get to class, or we’ll be late.” "
0,She grabbed her friend’s hand and jogged down the sidewalk before Austin could continue any conversation.
0,"This was not the encounter he was hoping for, but she had stared at him long enough that she should be able to recognize him if he met her later, so his minor effort was not completely wasted."
0,He could arrive a little earlier another day and see if he could spot her on her way to campus again.
0,"With less urgency, he could open a conversation about what happened today and go from there."
0,"“You,” the bearded man said with an odd intonation."
0,"“Sorry, but I don’t have the time either.” Austin turned his back to the man, but a hand gripped his wrist with thick fingers much larger than someone of his stature should have."
0,"“You,” the man repeated, removing what looked like a third of an English dictionary split down the binding."
0,Austin caught a glimpse of the clothing under the cloak.
0,It was crude and worn leather sewn in a shabby attempt to look like regular clothing.
0,"He tried to pull his arm away, but the man’s grip was iron."
0,Austin couldn’t even move his hand an inch.
0,"“Whatever your problem is, I’m not interested.”"
0,The man tried to hand the torn dictionary to Austin.
0,"He did not know English, so there was no way for him to communicate."
0,“No.
0,"I go,” Austin asserted as simply as he could, but the man’s grip would not release."
0,He wanted Austin to take the dictionary.
0,"With no other option available to him besides shouting and causing a scene, Austin retrieved the dictionary with his free hand."
0,“You.” The man pointed at the dictionary and then himself.
0,“I.”
0,Give it back?
0,What’s this guy’s deal?
0,"Austin tried to hand the dictionary back, but the man would not accept it."
0,"“You,” he repeated and brought his fingers to his mouth."
0,He then lowered them forward as if he was blowing a kiss.
0,“I.
0,"You,” he pointed to the dictionary, repeated the hand motion, and again finished again by saying, “I.”"
0,"“You want me to teach you English?” The man could not understand, so Austin tucked the torn book under his armpit."
0,"He pointed at the man, “you,” then himself, “want me,” and then extended his four fingers, thumb curled and hand vertical, touching his forefinger to his chin before tilting his hand forward in the sign language for speak, “to teach you English?” Austin knew very little sign language and doubted this man knew any either, but he was at a loss for what else he could do."
0,The man smiled within his thick beard.
0,"Conversation had been made, surprising Austin."
0,He reached into his cloak once again and removed a thick ring just as golden as Eydis’s hair.
0,He offered the ring to Austin who accepted it quickly.
0,The intricate engravings suggested exquisite craftsmanship and high value.
0,"Austin did not have the means to test the purity of the gold, but compared to the quality of the jewelry he had seen before, he did not doubt this ring was worth thousands of dollars due to the intricate craftsmanship alone."
0,"“You.” The man repeated the sign language motions for speak, pointed to the dictionary, and then pointed to himself."
0,"“I.” He pointed to himself again, “I,” pointed to the ring in Austin’s hand, and then pointed to Austin."
0,“You.”
0,Austin relaxed his arm in the man’s grip.
0,"The ring was payment for teaching the man English, an offer certainly worth investigating."
0,The ring was quite the payment.
0,"Thinking of no other way to confirm the offer, Austin slipped the ring over his thumb, the only digit thick enough to fit."
0,"The man smiled and released his grip, beckoning Austin to follow."
1,"He led Austin across the city, and over time, three more men joined."
0,"They did not wear cloaks like the short, bearded man."
0,They dressed in regular clothing of odd fit as if retrieved for free from a donation bin.
0,The similar brown hair and lightly tanned skin suggested they were associated with the bearded man.
0,What worried Austin was the daggers sheathed at their hips; not knives but daggers one would see in a medieval drama or fantasy movie.
0,They crossed the river and headed north.
0,Austin’s nerves reached a breaking point when they left the city proper.
0,His palms sweated heavily in the chilled air.
0,Something was very wrong with this situation.
0,He stopped.
0,“Where are we going?”
0,One of the daggers pointed at his back.
0,The man stood close enough that anyone driving down the nearly deserted road through private fields would not notice.
0,Austin no longer had the option to refuse.
0,"He already accepted the payment for teaching English, if learning English was even their goal."
0,His thoughts drew on the ongoing attacks in Europe commonly blamed on terrorists slipping in with the influx of refugees.
0,"If these men were terrorists, they would have no problems killing him."
0,Austin had no choice but to obey.
1,Austin was led to a house where he was confined for two days.
0,He understood quickly that they did not own the house.
0,"What could have happened to the previous owner constantly lingered in his mind, but unexpectedly the men treated Austin well."
0,They fed him the best food available to them despite their own apparent fasting.
0,"They ate little and only about once a day, but Austin received 3 full meals a day with portions almost larger than he could eat."
0,"Following his agreement, and partially out of fear, Austin taught English to the five men who lived there."
0,"He began with the alphabet and pronunciation and then moved to basic grammar, the “to be” verbs, and conjugations."
0,The men were overly studious as if there was a major driving force behind their desire to learn the language.
0,"The bearded man, Mordok, grew more and more pleased with the lessons, rewarding Austin a second ring of equivalent quality."
0,"“This gig isn’t bad,” Austin whispered to himself atop the sole bed in the house."
0,He often wondered where the others slept considering he never actually saw them asleep at any time.
0,"By Austin’s estimates, he had made five to ten thousand depending on the value of the rings in just three days of easy English lessons."
0,This was almost theft.
0,Perhaps these men did not understand the value of jewelry.
0,"If that was true, he could continue leeching off them for a while."
0,"His only complaint was the lack of women, but if they were so eager to reward him for his haphazard lessons, perhaps they could reward him with women too, although how they would get those women was certainly a worry."
0,Austin did not want to be involved in instigating any kidnappings.
0,"“Austin, kitchen.” Mordok rapped on the door to Austin’s room."
0,The English lessons were finished for the day so perhaps Austin would be rewarded with a third ring.
0,He could only hope.
0,Austin walked down the hall and froze at the entrance to the kitchen.
0,A black void stood near the table as if a tear had opened in space.
0,"The tip of a sword dug painfully into Austin’s back, nearly cutting his shirt."
0,"“In,” Mordok ordered from beside the void."
0,“In?
0,In there?
0,You want me to enter that?”
0,"The sword dug deeper, and Austin felt the tip prick through his skin."
0,He doubted he could run at this point.
0,He had already been paid twice.
0,What would happen to him if he entered that void?
0,The painful pressure of the sword pushed Austin forward until a kick to his back sent him stumbling into the void.
0,"It wrapped around him, suffocating him in a nauseating, claustrophobic spiral."
0,He would have vomited if not for the surprise that awaited him on the other side.
1,He collapsed onto a marble floor and struggled at first to push himself up.
0,His arms shook under his own weight that felt far heavier than it should.
0,He feared that the strange black void weakened him but then saw the feet of Mordok and the other men easily standing upright beside him.
0,"One of them laughed silently, and he knew it was at his expense."
0,"Austin heard a snap, and an unfamiliar voice gave a single order in an unknown language, “Deshalu.” A small sachet was brought by Mordok and crushed beneath Austin’s nose."
0,"The strong, herbal fumes punched him in the face."
0,He reeled back and stood by reflex with relative ease.
0,"His heart raced and his body shivered uncontrollably, increasing the anxiety he already felt, but at least his feet stood strong against the immense weight of his body."
0,It was only now that he noticed he stood on the floor of a grand marble hall that put to shame any pictures Austin had seen of European castles or cathedrals.
0,The large windows were not glass but crystal and refracted rainbow light over the hall.
0,A lone man occupied the throne in the back center of the hall before the windows.
0,"His apparel was simple, looking more like a robed monk than a king."
0,"One by one, the men who occupied the house on the outskirts finished exiting the rift and saluted the robed man, their fists to the center of their chest."
0,The rift behind Austin vanished with a wave of the monk-king’s hand.
0,Only one word could describe what Austin saw: magic.
0,“Where am I?”
0,"“Jethro house,” Mordok replied."
0,“Jethro?”
0,Mordok extended his hand humbly toward the throne.
0,"The monk-king, Jethro, smiled in some simple understanding or expectation after hearing the exchange in English."
0,Mordok saluted before speaking in length to Jethro in a language Austin could not recognize.
0,"However, he did pick up the mention of English no less than six times."
0,Was their true aim to learn English?
0,Who were these people?
0,"Once the exchange between Mordok and Jethro ended, Mordok grabbed Austin by his arm and pulled him toward the throne, forcing him to kneel before Jethro."
0,The racing heart in Austin’s chest thundered heavier.
0,He would have fled in his panic if not for Mordok’s iron grip.
0,"“You English Jethro,” Mordok ordered, somehow turning English into a verb."
0,He removed a third ring.
0,"“We this you,” he finished."
0,Jethro gave a calm order to Mordok who quickly stepped aside.
0,"He stood from his throne and reached into a hole in the air, his hand vanishing at the wrist."
0,"When it reappeared, he held a large leather bag which he set on the arm of the throne."
0,It jingled of metal.
0,Jethro loosened the tie and removed a gold coin that he flicked to Austin with his thumb.
0,"The coin was polished and beautiful, not lacking in craftsmanship compared to the two rings Mordok had given him."
0,"Next Jethro tore a large rift in the air beside him, but unlike the black void of earlier, Austin could see inside it like a window to another room."
0,A surprised woman stood on the other side.
0,Jethro reached in and pulled her through.
0,"Austin’s breath escaped him, and for a moment he could not feel the rapid beat of his panicked heart."
0,She was tall like Eydis but perhaps not quite as tall.
0,Her hair was not as golden as Eydis but was closer to ripe grain ready for harvest.
0,Her eyes were bluer than Eydis’s and her face rounder.
0,"Her breasts were modest and slightly smaller than Eydis’s, but her slender frame allowed them to build the feminine curve of her body."
0,Her quivering hips were perfectly smooth leading down to her long slender legs and dainty feet.
0,She was naked except for a transparent blue shawl draped over her shoulders.
0,"Where Eydis emitted an aura of authority like a queen, this woman who could be her older sister emitted the aura of a humble countryside mother, far more endearing."
0,"It was then that Austin noticed her thin, pointed ears and a slender tail extending down behind her between her legs to her knees."
0,She was not human.
0,"Jethro extended one hand toward the bag of gold, retracted it, and then extended his other to the naked woman."
0,He was presenting Austin a choice of reward.
0,Jethro stepped away from the throne after a stern word to the woman that made her shrink.
0,Mordok lifted Austin to his feet and stood him before the selection.
0,Austin’s mind grew blank.
0,He could not estimate the value of the gold in the bag.
0,"If he chose the woman, she would be his, or so he assumed."
0,No effort would be needed to control her.
0,"The herbal fumes buzzed in his brain, and his intoxication-heightened fear would not let him weigh the decision as he usually would."
0,One hand acted without knowledge of the other.
0,"Before Austin realized what he had done, his left hand gripped the sack of gold and his right hand held firm the woman’s wrist."
0,Angry shouts and the unsheathing of swords returned Austin’s senses.
0,"He shrunk in fear, yanking the woman into him and nearly collapsing with her to the ground, but then Jethro’s laughter quickly calmed both Austin’s rapidly growing fear and the anger of the men."
0,A few quick words silenced the hall.
0,Jethro tore another rift in the air and beckoned Austin to follow with both gold and woman in hand.
0,"Unlike the black void, Austin was less fearful of the destination he could see clearly on the other side."
0,"Although, he knew he had no other choice but to follow."
0,He entered with Mordok close behind.
1,The rift exited to what looked like a lounge with exquisite furnishings no lesser than the grandeur of the throne room.
0,Jethro grabbed the woman from Austin and pushed her down a narrow hallway.
0,Austin could see an enormous bed in the room at the end.
0,"“Is… Is this where I’m going to live?” Austin asked, nearly choking on his words, and knowing well that no one would be able to answer."
0,"If his assumption was true, this was certainly a far better deal than he could have imagined."
0,Jethro led Austin and Mordok to another adjacent room lined with bookshelves and with a desk in the back.
0,He sat Austin in the leather chair and removed a stack of what appeared to be parchment with an inkwell and quill.
0,Austin was too mentally exhausted to keep up with everything he had witnessed.
0,Who were these people?
0,Where was he taken?
0,Was that really magic?
0,Would he ever be able to return?
0,Did he even want to return?
0,"All Austin knew was that if he taught Jethro and whoever else English, perhaps this place and that woman would be his."
0,Perhaps he could earn more riches and even more women.
0,Austin’s hand shook from both his anxiety and that strange herb.
0,His voice cracked and stuttered as he taught the alphabet and pronunciation.
0,"Jethro’s amiable demeaner, his patience and kindness and apparent understanding of Austin’s fears, slowly calmed Austin’s nerves."
0,"By the end of the first lesson, Austin began to feel that his life was not in any danger, so long as he did what they asked."
0,"If these people, if Jethro the monk king, wanted to learn English so bad that they were willing to reward him with such regality, nothing in Gullivan could compare."
0,None of the girls he was pursuing could balance that scale.
0,"After Austin’s first night with the payment Jethro had given him, even Eydis vanished from his mind."
0,"Chapter 11
“Finding a Home.”
Eydis"
1,Eydis found herself standing in the central courtyard of the palace.
0,"It was a familiar memory, one of her earliest training sessions under Symra."
0,"Her father, Emperor Yuro, stood afar off with a judgmental glare."
0,"This was not long after Eydis had begun training, and he wanted to see her progress."
0,"Her opponent, arranged by Symra for the demonstration, was a fresh recruit of the palace guard."
0,"Although he was a recruit, all palace guard recruits were hand-selected High Elves who showed exceptional abilities among the empires seasoned soldiers."
0,This man who stood before her was no trainee.
0,“Begin!” Symra called.
0,Eydis did not have time to blink before the man was in front of her with his fist embedded in her stomach.
0,The impact knocked her back tumbling over the paved court in the center of the courtyard.
0,“Get up!” Symra ordered.
0,"Eydis rolled to her arms and knees, but she couldn’t stand."
0,She couldn’t breathe.
0,“Get up!” Symra ordered again.
0,Eydis looked over to the disappointed face of her father.
0,She was not expected to win.
0,She was only expected to do something.
0,Anything.
0,Her opponent grabbed Eydis by the arm and lifted her only high enough to hammer a second strong blow into her stomach.
0,"Eydis doubled over onto her back, and a weak cry escaped her lips."
0,"She kept wondering why she had to do this, why she had to endure all this pain."
0,"She was only a child not even two years old, and yet her father forced her to fight a seasoned soldier she could not hope in her wildest fantasies to defeat."
0,"And above everything, she hated hurting anyone."
0,"She despised pain, so why would she ever want to inflict it on others?"
0,“Stand up!” Another order.
0,Eydis looked again over to her father who did not meet her eyes.
0,He turned and walked away in utter disappointment at the poor spectacle.
0,"“Stand and fight or you will die,” Symra warned."
0,"Out of the corner of Eydis’s eye, she saw her opponent’s foot raised, ready to crush her head with his heel."
0,"A guard of the palace would never kill the first princess, but the terrified mind of a child did not know any better."
0,"In panic, Eydis threw a thin spike of wind at him."
0,"Her opponent’s heel stopped as intended right before it made contact with her cheekbone, but by that time the damage had already been done."
0,The man faltered back and fell.
0,"Eydis rose to her elbow to see that her thin spike had penetrated under the man’s chin into his head, and the small burst of wind created when it dissipated had killed him instantly."
0,"In this demonstration match orchestrated to show her father that she could indeed fight back, she killed for the first time."
0,"In Eydis’s memory, she became inconsolable and cried for days afterwards."
0,Symra tried to comfort her by explaining that the greatest honor for a guard was to use his life for the betterment of the royal family.
0,“Again!” Symra ordered.
0,Something was not right.
0,Eydis looked back at Symra who ordered another opponent to stand before her.
0,No…
0,Eydis lost control of her actions.
0,"She stood against her will, and the next match began."
0,Her new opponent was only a little taller than her.
0,He was not shorter.
0,"Eydis realized that she was now older, an adult."
0,"The match was one-sided again, but this time in her favor."
0,Her opponent could not land a hit.
0,"Not a minute later, his dead body hit the ground."
0,“Again!” Symra ordered.
0,Another dead body.
0,“Again!”
0,"Dead bodies grew around Eydis, and no matter how hard she tried, she could not stop herself from killing each and every one of them."
0,"Next, her two younger brothers stood before her, their thin rapiers drawn against her, but their form was poor."
0,"They never had to go through the same grueling training she had, only enough for sport and self-defense."
0,"“No!” Eydis cried, but she could not stop herself from releasing a wide blade of wind with the swipe of her hand before they could defend or retaliate."
0,"The severed bodies of her brothers fell to the ground, more real than all of the fighting she had done previous."
0,Their bodies lying in their own gore was burned into her memories.
0,"“Again,” spoke another, male voice."
0,She recognized it immediately.
0,She turned her head to see the assassin standing in Symra’s place with a pleased grin on his face.
0,This time her father stood before her and died.
0,"Next her mother, then Ceil who cried and begged Eydis to stop."
0,"By the end, Eydis stood on the bodies of her family and people."
0,"“You brought this upon yourself,” the assassin said."
0,“How does it feel to have everyone you love taken away from you?”
0,"Eydis turned to face him, unable to move."
0,"He swiped his arm to behead her with his strange barrier magic, and she woke up."
1,"Eydis’s heart raced, and she fought back the cry that almost escaped, muffling it into a soft squeal."
0,She didn’t want to wake Sean who was in the next room over.
0,Tears streamed from her eyes.
0,The air was harder to breathe than normal.
0,She quickly realized she was hyperventilating but could not calm enough to stop.
0,"The assassin’s words, “You brought this upon yourself,” kept repeating in her mind."
0,She wanted to curl up into a ball and disappear.
0,Never had her trauma overcome her so powerfully.
0,Eydis scrambled out of bed to her phone sitting atop Justin’s desk on its charger.
0,"She called the only person she felt she could talk to, Sammy."
0,"Sammy quickly agreed to come, and Eydis waited by the front door for her arrival."
0,"Justin slept peacefully on the couch, completely oblivious to the emotional strain she was under, but she could not wake him."
0,"No matter how terrible she felt, she could not burden him further than she already was."
0,"Although, watching him sleep so peacefully did help calm her while she waited."
0,Justin and Sean’s home was safe.
0,The assassin was not here.
0,There was no one here she had to fight.
0,"The doorknob turned, and Sammy slipped inside."
0,"“Are you okay,” she asked, seeing Eydis standing in the dark."
0,Eydis’s cheeks glimmered with lines of tears that had not yet dried.
0,"Eydis worried that Sammy’s voice would wake Justin, but almost as if Sammy read her thoughts she replied, “He is a deep sleeper, so we’re fine."
0,Let’s go to your room.”
1,They sat together on the bed.
0,Sammy did not speak up or ask for an explanation.
0,She only wrapped her arm around Eydis and leaned her head against her shoulder.
0,"“I had… I saw…” Eydis began, but her mind would not find the words she needed."
0,"She understood the essentials of English grammar, but her vocabulary was still quite small."
0,"“My family, I saw my family dead,” Eydis finally said."
0,"“You had a bad dream, a nightmare?” Sammy replied."
0,“Yes…” Tears started falling anew.
0,“Come here.” Sammy pulled Eydis down to her chest and coddled her.
0,“You’re okay.
0,No one is going to hurt you.”
0,"“I think you have post-traumatic stress disorder,” Sammy said after Eydis calmed down."
0,“People usually shorten it to PTSD.
0,"It’s when something bad happened to you, and then you remember it without wanting to, and it makes you scared and sick and cry and feel all those bad feelings all over again.”"
0,"“I think this is that, yes,” Eydis replied after some thought."
0,“Having your family killed is sure to do that.
0,I’m so sorry that it happened and that you went through all that.” Sammy gave Eydis another hug.
0,Time passed again in silence.
0,Eydis understood that Sammy was giving her time to sort out her thoughts and feelings.
0,"Sammy could do nothing to help her, so she was only there for support."
0,Symra held that role in the past.
0,"As strict as Symra was during training, she cared deeply about Eydis, enough to risk the emperor’s wrath and her position as head trainer of the palace guard by demanding that Eydis’s training end before serious harm was done."
0,"Yuro had high expectations of Eydis, so high that Eydis felt they were impossible to fulfill."
0,She lived constantly in the shadow of his disappointment.
0,Everyone expected greatness and perfection from her.
0,"The only one who didn’t was Ceil, but Eydis could not rely on Ceil for support."
0,The girl was younger and had her own trauma from being sold by her parents to Yuro at such a young age.
0,Eydis was the only one who was willing to be Ceil’s support.
0,"As Eydis got older, expectations grew."
0,Yuro further accelerated her education.
0,He doubled and then tripled her training hours under Symra before her training eventually stopped.
0,He gradually became so paranoid and afraid of something he would never tell her.
0,"She bore the full brunt of that paranoia, even to the point that he forced her to provide blood every day leaving her weak and anemic on top of her training."
0,Eydis came to a realization.
0,"That feeling or condition Sammy explained, she had felt that most of her life."
0,She explained to Sammy the best she could about her life in the palace and asked if PTSD could come from that.
0,"“Oh, god…” Sammy said, appalled by what she heard."
0,“Of course that would cause PTSD.
0,God!
0,"After everything that has happened to you, you deserve so much better."
0,You deserve a much better life than that.”
0,Sammy clasped Eydis’s shoulders.
0,“What happened to you was terrible.
0,"You did not have any choice coming here, but now that you are here you should make the best of it."
0,Maybe this is your chance to start over.
0,You have me and Justin.
0,"With our help, you can create a home for yourself here, without all that shit that you had to deal with before.”"
0,Sammy’s words stunned Eydis.
0,Were such fantasies really okay for her to indulge in?
0,Could she really start a different life without the pressures and expectations of being an heir to the Amelian Empire?
0,"She worried about her people, especially considering she disappeared after the assassination of her family, but she had no guarantee of returning to Whinhlem."
0,She might live the rest of her life on Earth.
0,"“Can I live here?” Eydis asked, worried that there was some hidden taboo in her question."
0,"Justin already said she could stay, but Sean gave strict terms, one of which was for her to find her own place to stay."
0,Sammy’s suggestion stood in direct conflict with his.
0,What would creating such a home take?
0,"She did not know, but there was hope in Sammy’s words."
0,"Unknown to Eydis, a small smile began to creep over her lips."
0,Sammy noticed it and beamed.
0,“Of course!
0,"And while you are getting yourself situated here, I’ll spend as much time with you as I can."
0,"I’m no psychologist, and we can’t really send you to one for your PTSD given your situation, but I can talk to you whenever you need."
0,"I should spend the night again, too, and we can talk about something better, like,” Sammy paused to think."
0,"“You can tell me about that girl, Ceil, that you were friends with, and I can tell you about my family.”"
0,"Sammy spoke quickly in her excitement, and Eydis had trouble understanding some of it, but she understood enough."
0,A genuine smile appeared on Eydis’s face.
0,"If such a free life was possible, she would do everything she could to obtain it."
0,Sammy pulled Eydis to her feet and looked at the clock.
0,It was past seven.
0,"“Now that we talked the night away, let’s wake up Justin and have him cook us some breakfast.”"
0,Eydis headed for her door with a new lightness to her step.
0,"Chapter 12
“Repay kindness in double.”
Justin"
1,Justin ended his call with Dr. Shuman with a sigh.
0,"While Eydis was preparing for departure in the bathroom, he had made a quick call to see if Dr. Shuman had found a way to get Eydis into one of the girl’s dormitories."
0,Dr. Shuman had no luck so far.
0,"Sammy was helping Dr. Shuman at first, hopefully to get a room that she and Eydis could share, but Justin was unsure whether she was still searching."
0,"At some point, she simply stopped bringing up the topic to him when they talked in private about Eydis."
0,"An open bed this late in the semester was extremely rare with the limited dorm space, let alone Eydis lacking a student visa or other form of identification."
0,"Sammy had suggested the day after she met Eydis that she could use the town’s refugee hostel or to be upfront about Eydis’s situation to the authorities to see if the city could set her up with lodging, but Eydis vehemently struck both these ideas down, arguing that the fewer people who knew about her true origins, the better."
0,"For whatever reason, Eydis refused to change where she was staying."
0,“You ready to go?” Justin asked as Eydis walked into the living room.
0,"“Yes,” she replied eagerly."
0,Justin led Eydis out the door and to the right to the small driveway-like parking lot of his apartment.
0,"This was the first time Eydis had ridden in a car, so her excitement was palpable."
0,"To add to her excitement, they were headed somewhere new for her, the grocery store."
0,"Eydis did not eat much, but because she was living with Justin, he had the responsibility of feeding her."
0,"He could have managed by skimming down on his own meals, which he had planned on doing before meeting Eydis in order to lose some weight, but now that Sammy was aware of Eydis’s situation, she began spending a lot of time at Justin’s apartment with Eydis."
0,"Of course, she expected him to feed her as well whenever she visited."
0,"After all, Sammy did buy all Eydis’s clothing, of which she frequently reminded him."
0,"With three mouths to feed, his two weeks’ worth of food lasted only one, leading to an earlier-than-usual grocery shopping excursion."
1,"Justin felt like a parent trying to keep his rambunctious child in line in the grocery store, but the one bouncing with excitement was not a child but an elven princess over twice his age."
0,"Much to Justin’s relief, Sammy was not present due to her swimming class, but that left him as Eydis’s sole caretaker, not that he minded."
0,"Eydis clung to his sleeve and pulled him around, pointing to all the packaged products with the twinkling sparkle of discovery in her eyes."
0,"Everything was new and exciting and mysterious and brought up question after curious question about how, where, and why products were here in their various forms."
0,"“Metal is cheap in this country, yes?” Eydis admired the label on a can of refried beans."
0,Eydis continually amazed Justin by how fast she learned English.
0,"Her speech was simple and a little slow, but she had no accent."
0,The colloquial pronunciation of words was something she mimicked perfectly from the start.
0,“Much metal is used to… what is the word…?” 
0,Eydis returned the can to the shelf and pulled out her smartphone.
0,Sammy installed a dictionary app which Eydis immediately mastered despite being unable to do anything else on the phone yet but make and receive calls and texts.
0,The only downside was her tendency to become sidetracked looking up reference after reference.
0,"Watching Eydis select links to new words one after another, Justin knew this would be another long episode and decided to continue shopping, leaving Eydis where she stood in the isle."
1,"About twenty minutes later, Justin returned to check up on Eydis only to find her still glued to her phone."
0,She had not even moved a millimeter.
0,He sighed in bewilderment but also felt this habit was rather cute.
0,He couldn’t help but smile.
0,"Shaking his head, he pushed the now full cart next to her and tapped her on the shoulder."
0,“This!” Eydis thrust the smartphone an inch from his nose and quickly retracted it.
0,“Preserve.
0,"Much metal is used to preserve food, yes?"
0,Should be expensive but is very cheap.”
0,"Many of Eydis’s questions were simple inquiries, some of which Justin had never really thought about or felt the need to investigate, such as what plastic was and how was it created or why so many products seemed half prepared, being created from raw ingredients but never refined into a completed dish."
0,The refried beans were one such example.
0,"“You could do more with just beans,” she had said before inquiring about its cylindrical metal packaging."
0,"“Well, after we eat the food, the cans get sent back to be melted down into new cans to store more food, so they’ll just end up back on the store shelf again."
0,It’s called recycling.”
0,Eydis’s eyes opened wide.
0,"“You do not throw away the metal, but you send metal back so stores can put more food in to sell again?"
0,Recycling is smart.
0,My world can learn much from this world.”
0,"A few steps were missing in the process, but Justin decided to keep quiet about it."
1,"Once finished with her recycling revelation, Eydis continued bouncing around the isles."
0,Justin had already gathered the items on his shopping list and decided to humor Eydis for a little while longer.
0,“What is this?”
0,Justin almost fell back from the box of gummy fruit snacks thrust in his face as he turned into the isle after Eydis.
0,“This does not look like fruit.” 
0,Eydis eyed the picture of small and colorful bite-sized gummies with suspicion.
0,"She then turned to the back of the box to read the ingredients, which proved futile due to the complicated words, many of which Justin didn’t know."
0,Justin explained the simplest way he could.
0,“They are sweets.
0,They use fruit for flavor.
0,We can buy a box for you to try.
0,Pick one you like.”
0,"Much to Justin’s surprise, Eydis selected a box immediately."
0,She ignored all the cartoon- or movie-themed boxes and chose one that had big words stating “Natural” where the gummies looked like the fruit that matched the flavor.
0,"It was the most expensive of the boxes, but Justin reasoned that it would be better for Eydis to try a quality version first."
0,She was a princess after all.
0,"However, he was curious about her reasoning."
0,“Why did you pick this one?”
0,Eydis’s expression froze.
0,She was not expecting her selection to be scrutinized.
0,This was also the first time Justin had asked her a question since entering the store.
0,"She stood in thought as gears visibly turned in her head, but after a while she made little progress."
0,Justin felt bad that she troubled herself over a relatively pointless question.
0,“It’s no big deal.”
0,Eydis smiled and shook her head.
0,"“I have a reason, but I cannot explain well."
0,It felt… clean?”
0,“Felt?” 
0,Eydis thought to herself again and then grabbed one of the cheapest boxes from the shelf.
0,“This one feels dirty.
0,Not bad.
0,"It is safe to eat, but not good.”"
0,Justin took the box from Eydis and compared the ingredients with the organic fruit snacks.
0,The cheap box contained artificial sweeteners and flavoring as well as other chemicals the organic fruit snacks lacked.
0,"Realizing that Eydis might have a keen sense for healthy food, Justin pulled a carton of eggs from his cart and handed them to her."
0,“What about these eggs?”
0,“Bad.” Eydis responded immediately.
0,“You must cook.
0,You cannot eat not cooked.”
0,Justin lowered his voice so others could not hear.
0,“Is this an elf ability?”
0,Eydis shook her head lightly.
0,"“No, it is life magic."
0,I was taught it to save from poison.
0,It is easy for me because I am a High Elf.
0,I do not need to try.
0,I can just… feel?” 
0,"Eydis pulled out her phone to look for the right word to describe how she knew, but Justin stopped her."
0,He did not want to wait another twenty minutes.
0,“I understand.
0,Want to help me choose better food then?” 
0,Justin decided that this was as good of an opportunity as ever to start eating healthy.
1,He took Eydis back around every isle of the store.
0,"Now with a mission, Eydis did not jump from product to product swelling with curiosity but seemed overly eager to focus on her task, which surprised Justin."
0,But what surprised Justin most was what he noticed as Eydis added and removed food from his cart with fervor.
0,"The healthiest food was not always the most expensive, completely counterintuitive to what he had thought."
0,"The cheap bread he had chosen was better than the more expensive loaves according to Eydis, although the best was the fresh bakery bread that would have placed Justin well over budget."
0,"Eydis was displeased with all the eggs and decided on picking the carton that was the freshest, even swapping out two eggs from another carton."
0,Justin had to wonder if there was something wrong with how the providers process their eggs for sale that would make them unsafe.
0,"As their shopping continued, Justin did notice some limits to Eydis’s ability."
0,She had a much harder time determining the quality of products in cans or completely dried products like pasta or spices.
0,"Likewise, the opposite was true for fresh produce."
0,Eydis didn’t even need to be near the vegetables in order to tell which ones were the freshest or lacked pesticides.
0,He made a mental note to let Eydis check the refrigerator to point out the food that may have gone bad.
0,"The contents of Justin’s cart were swapped out with haste, and the resulting cart looked nothing like it had before."
0,Eydis appeared like a picky spouse or girlfriend who knew exactly what products and brands she wanted but her partner had chosen all wrong while she was preoccupied elsewhere.
0,Men and women who watched them nodded and smiled sympathetically at Justin as if telling him they felt his pain.
0,Some of them had seen him shopping on his own earlier only adding validation to the false assumption.
0,Justin could only smile back at their ignorance and wasted sympathy.
1,"Once the groceries were in the trunk of Sean’s car, Justin opened the passenger side door for Eydis."
0,He entered the driver seat and was about to start the car.
0,“Justin?”
0,"Hearing his name called in a soft tone, Justin turned to Eydis with his hand still on the key in the ignition."
0,He thought he saw a mild worry on her face.
0,"He let go of the key, and his mind raced to try and find what the reason might be."
0,His shopping list became thirty dollars more expensive than what he had planned.
0,"She might have been worried about that, but spending a little more was the price for eating healthy."
0,"Although, he was also feeding her, and so maybe she felt bad that he was spending more to provide for her."
0,"Or it could be something worse, like she somehow realized or noticed something dangerous."
0,Did she have some way of telling if the assassin appeared?
0,“Was I useful to you?”
0,Eydis’s question froze Justin’s spiraling thoughts.
0,"He sat silent, unsure what to say."
0,Why was she worried about being of use to him?
0,"Scouring his mind for an answer led nowhere, and the longer her question remained unanswered, the more prominent the worry on her face grew."
0,Her eyes were like a child’s trying to offer a hand-drawn picture as an apology to her parents for accidently breaking an expensive vase.
0,“Hold on a sec.”
0,Justin left the car and opened the trunk.
0,He searched the bags for a specific item and returned to the driver’s seat.
0,He opened the box of fruit snacks and handed a packet to Eydis.
0,“As a thank you for today.
0,You were a great help.”
0,"He had already planned to give her the snacks once they returned to his apartment, but hopefully giving them now would alleviate her concerns."
0,"Much to his relief, the worry slowly melted from Eydis’s face, changing to excitement."
0,She took the packet but was unsure how to open it.
0,Justin grabbed a packet for himself and demonstrated how to use the tear seam.
0,Eydis removed an apple-shaped gummy and was immediately amused by its squishy-yet-firm texture.
0,"Seeing Justin toss one in his mouth, Eydis ate hers as well."
0,“HmmmmMMMM!” 
0,The corners of Eydis’s mouth curled upwards.
0,"She shook her fists and tapped her feet, and when she had chewed and swallowed it, she faced Justin with a joyful, beaming smile."
0,“What is this?
0,"This is, this is… I do not know…!” "
0,"Instead of taking out her phone to look for the words she needed to express her feelings, Eydis placed a grape gummy in her mouth."
0,A repeat of the same excited shaking and tapping ensued accompanied by her blushing face.
0,Watching Eydis’s pleased expression made Justin’s face heat up.
0,He could get used to seeing this side of Eydis.
0,"Not wanting to stare, he faced forward to start the car."
0,"“Glad you like them,” he said with a smile."
1,"Justin and Eydis returned to their apartment to find Sean looking up at them from the sofa, glasses on and book in hand."
0,Eydis managed a light bow while carrying bags in both hands.
0,She always made an effort to be as polite to Sean as possible.
0,"He was still opposed to her staying in the apartment, and she had yet to find a job to help pay for her living expenses as agreed upon."
0,"Sean often chastised Justin for doting on Eydis, but he was oblivious to Eydis’s circumstances."
0,"Justin feared that if he told Sean, Sean would contact the police."
0,"For now, the explanation Justin gave Sean was that Eydis was homeless after escaping an abusive relationship."
0,"The formerly planned explanation that was told to the school would only give Sean further reason to get the authorities involved, regardless of how Eydis felt."
0,"Sammy was in on the deception, so she was always careful in her conversations with Eydis when Sean was around."
0,"After Eydis placed her bags on the table, she removed a packet of fruit snacks and handed it to Sean with the biggest smile she could muster."
0,"It was forced, but Sean understood her goodwill and accepted the packet."
0,“Thanks.”
0,Eydis flashed a genuine smile at his gratitude and pranced back to help Justin put the groceries away.
0,And toss out half the leftovers in the fridge.
1,"* * *
In the afternoon, Justin worked on his homework and left Eydis to her own devices, which often resulted in meditation or English studies."
0,He found himself having difficulty concentrating.
0,"He felt tired, but the exhaustion was not from lack of sleep or overwork nor was it mental or emotional."
0,"There was something different, uniquely distinct, about it."
0,"He was familiar with this kind, and it would repeat every couple of months like clockwork, but alone it was no reason for concern."
0,It was only the first sign.
0,"Once finished with his homework, after taking three hours instead of his planned one hour on something that was no more than simple review and mind-numbingly monotonous busy-work that professors seemed to be overly obsessed with, he looked up at the kitchen light."
0,He could feel a pressure in his eyes like thumbs were pressed forcefully on them.
0,The light almost had the faint line of a halo around it.
0,The second sign and now a reason for Justin to worry.
0,Medicine and the conviction to not exert himself for the rest of the day might be all he needed.
0,Justin hoped it was all he needed.
0,He did not want the alternative.
0,"He trudged to the couch next to Eydis who was deep into meditation, but the moment Justin sat down she grew attentive, which was odd."
0,Normally Justin needed to speak to her or tap her on the shoulder to break her out of her trance.
0,Eydis noticed something was off.
0,"She grabbed the side of his sleeve lightly, but before she could voice her concern, the front door opened."
0,"“Hey, Eydis!” It was Sammy."
0,"“You could knock,” Justin said, leaning his head back."
0,“You know how you said that there was something strange about that person who got hit by a truck outside of town two weeks ago?”
0,"If the one who got hit was what Eydis called a minum, it would be cause for concern, but rumors were just rumors."
0,"Tiny people did exist on earth, after all."
0,"They increased their caution for a week, but no other signs or odd occurrences followed."
0,"“Well, nothing happened, but there might still be a chance of someone showing up, right?"
0,"I talked with one of my friends, Chloe.” Sammy waved her hands as if she interpreted Justin’s listless stare as accusatory."
0,"“I didn’t tell her the truth, so don’t worry."
0,She’s attending a self-defense class.
0,"It’s being held in a half-hour, and I thought we should go.”"
0,"“Have fun,” Justin said while slouching deeper into the couch."
0,"“No, you are coming too.” Sammy grabbed both Eydis and Justin’s wrists."
0,“This is for me and you more than her.
0,Eydis already knows how to fight.
0,And god knows you would be worthless if something happens.”
0,"The last thing Justin wanted right now was to get involved in heavy physical activity, but Sammy was not one to listen to reason, so he wearily stood from the couch."
0,“I’ll watch.” 
1,The class was held in a room of the health and fitness building on the north side of campus.
0,The room was a simple exercise studio with four long windows along its breadth looking out to the hallway on one side.
0,"The entryway sat in the middle, two windows on each side."
0,"Perhaps it was used for other martial arts or wrestling, because several large rolls of thick foam mats lined the back walls."
0,Only three were unrolled for the class.
0,"A storage room sat off in the back corner with one door ajar revealing both exercise and combat equipment such as pads, focus mitts, and sandbags."
0,Sammy switched Eydis’s woven cap for a wide exercise headband to cover her ears and tied Eydis’s hair into a ponytail.
0,"Once inside the room, Justin noticed something Sammy had neglected to mention."
0,"When probing Sammy for an answer, she was also surprised."
0,“I didn’t realize this was a girl’s self-defense class.”
0,Justin shrugged and took a seat against the wall on the left side of the room.
0,He was not the only guy there.
0,Two others to his right sat conversing near the corner of the room below the windows to the hallway.
0,Perhaps their girlfriends or otherwise were taking the class.
0,He doubted they were there just to spectate.
0,"“I wasn’t planning on participating anyway,” he said, mostly to himself."
0,"Eydis continued looking back at Justin while Sammy pulled her to the group of eight women and introduced her to a long-haired, redheaded girl Justin recognized as Sammy’s former roommate, Chloe."
0,"Other than her name, he never had much opportunity to get to know her while he was dating Sammy because men were not allowed in the women’s dorms, and Chloe rarely left her room back then."
0,"Once the instructor arrived, Dr. Madison Calliby--her more familiar students greeted her as Maddi--the class began."
0,"After warmups and ten minutes of instruction, the students paired up for practice."
0,Sammy paired with Eydis to help hide Eydis’s strangely light body weight.
0,"From the start, Justin saw that Eydis was clearly far more skilled than any of the students."
0,Sammy was right.
0,Eydis could fight.
0,"By the halfway point, everyone was positive that Eydis had received martial training, but when asked, Eydis could not name the art she knew, only that it was taught within her family."
0,"Sammy explained that Eydis was a foreigner who was still learning English, which appeased most of the curiosity."
0,"At the end of the session, there was still some time remaining, so the students begged Eydis to show them something from her martial art."
0,Dr. Calliby gave permission for a simple demonstration if Eydis was willing.
0,"Eydis thought for a moment, and then decided on a grapple escape, given that this was a self-defense class."
0,Dr. Calliby volunteered to be the assailant because the height difference between Sammy and Eydis would not prove well for demonstration.
0,"She was half a head shorter than Eydis, about six feet tall."
0,"Eydis was reluctant, but after Sammy whispered something into the instructor’s ear, she gave the okay."
0,"At Eydis’s request, Dr. Calliby held Eydis around the waist from behind."
0,Dr. Calliby was on her back with Eydis only holding her wrist.
0,Justin could not tell what happened.
0,"Neither could anyone else, especially the instructor."
0,"Through Justin’s eyes, once Eydis grabbed Dr. Calliby’s wrist and shifted slightly, Dr. Calliby’s posture buckled, and she fell without a chance for resistance."
0,"It almost looked like an act, and she fell on purpose."
0,"She stayed motionless for a long time, staring up at Eydis purely dumbfounded."
0,Sammy ran over and helped Dr. Calliby to her feet so that Eydis did not have to.
0,Eydis’s skill piqued the instructor’s curiosity.
0,“How long have you been practicing?”
0,"“About two, so… Maybe eighteen, no, nineteen years?” "
0,"Justin understood that Eydis had to convert the years, but Dr. Calliby took her first statement directly."
0,“You’ve been training since you were two?
0,It definitely shows.” She patted Eydis on the shoulder.
0,“Would you be willing to help here as an instructor?”
0,“That’s perfect!” Sammy grabbed Eydis by both arms.
0,"“You’ve been wanting a job, and you’re definitely qualified!”"
0,"Once all the other students left, Eydis and Sammy stayed behind to discuss terms of employment."
0,Sammy’s help was vital given that Eydis knew nothing about the hiring process or appropriate hourly wages or anything the average job hunter would investigate before submitting a resume or applying for a job.
0,"The university sponsored the class, and the instructor was a professor."
0,"She explained that she was free to request an aid and that the university would pay, but she had not done so in the past because the class was always small."
0,"Pay for teacher assistant positions were decided by affiliated credit hours taken, but Eydis was not a student."
0,"With about nineteen Earth-years’ worth of martial training, Eydis was certainly qualified as Sammy had stated."
0,"Justin was sure that Eydis could open her own studio, gym, or dojo and earn far more than the university was willing to offer, but Eydis was against any job capable of advertising herself to that degree."
0,"Dr. Calliby agreed to argue on Eydis’s behalf for the maximum pay an assistant could be given, $18.50 an hour and usually reserved for assistants to graduate-level classes."
0,"That included hours spent on lesson planning and preparation, not just time spent instructing."
0,"Sammy still thought the rate was cheap, but it was more than she was making as a librarian and over twice what Justin made at the help desk."
0,The only remaining issue for Eydis was identification.
0,Sammy mentioned the university recently enacted policies for temporary refugee employment that did not require identification or a work visa so long as one or the other were in process.
0,"The refugee jobs were usually grounds work or janitorial, but there were no provisions restricting which university job the refugee employment policy could apply, a loophole Sammy was more than happy to abuse."
0,Sammy’s investigations on behalf of Eydis finally bore fruit.
0,Contact information was exchanged with an agreement to continue the hiring process once Eydis applied for a refugee ID.
1,Sammy and Eydis returned to Justin who had sat silently against the wall the entire class.
0,Sammy extended a helping hand to Justin who was not steady on his feet.
0,"His first foot was solid, but his second sent him awry and forced him to place his hand on Sammy’s shoulder for balance."
0,Sammy’s abrasive front vanished in an instant and was replaced by a nostalgic expression of care he had not seen since the months they were dating.
0,“You doing okay?” she asked.
0,Justin rubbed his temples with the thumb and middle finger of his free hand.
0,“The usual.”
0,“Ah!
0,You should have said something!”
0,“I’ll be fine.
0,I took medicine.
0,I’ll just go to bed early tonight.”
0,“Is Justin sick?” Eydis’s voice was seeped in concern.
0,“Not sick.
0,He just has bad headaches frequently.”
0,“Headache?” Eydis was not familiar with the word.
0,Sammy explained what a headache was to the best of her ability as they walked back to the bus and assured her that Justin would be fine after some rest.
0,"Sammy parted at the bus stop to head to her dorm, and Justin and Eydis took the bus back to the river."
0,Justin changed into something comfortable and bundled up in blankets on the couch.
0,He could already feel it coming like a heavy hand pressing his head into the pillow.
0,"He took more medicine and tried not to focus on it, and in time, he managed to fall asleep."
1,"* * *
Justin woke to a thunderous pain."
0,"He rolled to his right side, but the soft pillow became a vice that gripped his head and threatened to squeeze his brain out through his right eye."
0,“Ahhu…” A weak moan was all his voice had strength to cry.
0,Even supporting himself on his shaking elbow to keep pressure off his right side only caused the vice to grip down on the left as well.
0,His head felt like it was being split in two between the jaws of the vice.
0,The medicine Justin had taken that afternoon either wore off or was not enough.
0,The clock on the wall read half past midnight.
0,So much for 8-hour relief.
0,Only half that had passed.
0,He slid his left leg and then his right off the couch taking care to set them down softly on the hardwood floor so that any impact would not travel up his leg and to his head.
0,"Once on his knees, he attempted to stand, but the slight motion caused extreme nausea."
0,"The room spun, and the vice on his head spun along with it."
0,"He fell to his elbows, and the impact caused the pain in his head to spread down his neck and to his shoulders."
0,His stomach bubbled.
0,"Justin scrambled to the hall and into the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet before vomiting."
0,The contracting of his stomach forced pressure to his head and face.
0,"This increased the pain which further increased the nausea, causing more vomiting."
0,"The torturous cycle repeated a second, third, and then fourth time until his stomach had nothing left to give."
0,"The dry heaving was worse than his vomiting, and the agonizing pressure made his vision grow white."
0,This was his worst migraine in years.
0,There was nothing he could do at this point but endure it.
0,"If he was lucky, he would pass out like the last time he had a migraine this bad."
0,Was he 19 or 20?
0,Justin couldn’t remember.
0,"He just hoped he would wake up in the hospital on enough drugs that this night would only feel like a terrible dream, just like that time."
0,Justin rested his cheek on the toilet seat once he had a break in heaving.
0,"Two shifting, blurry legs stood in the bathroom doorway."
0,"He looked up and saw Eydis staring at him with wide, terrified eyes."
0,Justin attempted a self-depreciating grimace from showing Eydis his miserable state but gave up when moving his cheeks worsened the ache.
0,Eydis grabbed Justin without speaking a word.
0,He could feel wind pressure beneath him lift him up as she carried him over to the couch.
0,"Aside from the light pressure of her arms on his back and legs, he felt as if he was riding a cloud."
0,She did not lay him on the couch but instead sat on it herself and situated him on the floor so that he could lean back against her.
0,"Unable to hold back the ensuing nausea from his movements, Justin vomited again, but having already emptied his stomach, only thin bile ran down his chin onto his shirt."
0,"Unfazed, Eydis leaned Justin forward to help the bile leave his mouth."
0,The motion almost made him retch again.
0,She then pulled him back against the couch between her legs and leaned forward.
0,"After tilting Justin’s head back, she placed her forehead against his and her hands on the sides of his head."
0,Justin felt a warm pulse starting from his forehead and continuing down through his body.
0,"After a moment, Eydis wrapped her legs around him to hold him close and then spoke."
0,"“Sorry, this will hurt.”"
0,What followed after Eydis’s warning made Justin’s migraine feel like nothing more than a benign paper cut.
0,"The vice that was crushing his head was replaced by hooks digging in and yanking out hundreds of barbed spikes, pulling everything inside him out with them."
0,The pain quickly spread through his entire body.
0,"He writhed and screamed, but his voice made no more sound than a raspy exhale."
0,Eydis continued holding him tight with strength beyond what should have been possible for her light frame.
0,"Justin wished with all his heart to die, to stop the pain, but when he felt that his body was about to give in to his wish, the pain weakened."
0,"The spikes became pins, and the pins became an itch."
0,"With the ebbing of the pain, his migraine ebbed with it."
0,"Relief washed over him, and he began to sob but was soon assaulted by shivers of exhaustion greater than any he had ever felt before."
0,"This cold tiredness left him feeling like he was a moment from death’s door, or perhaps that he did die, and that was the reason the pain went away."
0,But the exhaustion was not death.
0,Justin felt an illness accompanying it.
0,"He tried turning to face Eydis, but she held his head firm."
0,“Do not move.
0,I am not done.”
0,"A soothing sensation swirled inside Justin’s head starting from where her forehead touched and spread to his neck, shoulders, back, and then extremities, just as the pain had before."
0,The shivers ceased and Justin felt warm.
0,"The deathlike exhaustion changed to physical exhaustion as his body relaxed, losing the will to support itself."
0,Justin sat completely limp in Eydis’s grasp for a few more minutes before she released him.
0,“I am done.” 
0,Eydis rested Justin’s limp body against the couch.
0,She pulled off his soiled shirt and walked to his room to retrieve another.
0,"He watched as with each small step, the next step carried a little more urgency, and she returned in a trot with a mildly pained expression."
0,He looked into her anguished face as she wiped his and placed a clean shirt on him.
0,"He tried to tell her that he felt fine now and that his pain was gone, but he found that he had no voice."
0,"Eydis struggled to lift him onto the couch, and after a few minutes of strenuous effort, Justin was comfortably laying down."
0,"Eydis knelt down to grab the blanket to spread over him, but her body trembled when she tried to stand."
0,"Unable to lift even the blanket, she fell to her side."
0,"Her face was pale, and she was sweating profusely."
0,"If Justin could have felt his heart, he knew it would have been racing in panic."
0,"He tried calling out to Eydis, but his voice remained mute."
0,His mouth would not move.
0,"His arms, legs, even his fingers did not obey."
0,What he assumed was his body relaxing after such a traumatizing experience was something far worse.
0,He was paralyzed.
0,"Justin tried to move, but no matter his mental struggle, his body would not listen."
0,Fear and confusion circled his mind.
0,What did Eydis do to him?
0,Why did she collapse immediately after?
0,"With his body paralyzed, how could he help the woman on the floor before him?"
0,Sean.
0,"Justin took the deepest breath he could to call for his roommate, but the breath was far too shallow."
0,"Air left his mouth, but no sound followed."
0,He tried once more with as much force as he could muster.
0,His voice was small and would not carry down the hall.
0,Justin repeatedly called Sean and soon found that control returned to his lips and tongue.
0,"With each breath he could breathe deeper, his voice grew louder, and his pronunciation improved."
0,"A door down the hall opened and Sean rushed to the bathroom, having smelled the vomit."
0,“Justin?”
0,“Living room.”
0,Sean hurried to Justin and saw Eydis collapsed in front of the couch.
0,“What happened?” 
0,"Eydis lay unconscious, her pointed ears in full view."
0,Sean knelt next to Eydis and touched her shoulder.
0,“She’s burning up.
0,I thought it was you who threw up.”
0,“It was.
0,I’ll explain after.
0,"I can’t move, so please, take her to her bed and do something about her fever.”"
0,Sean looked at her ears and reached down almost to touch them.
0,“Is our medicine okay for her to take?”
0,“…I don’t know.” 
0,“Wet socks and towel then.”
0,Sean lifted Eydis in a bridal carry and froze.
0,His eyes narrowed as he scanned Eydis’s body from head to toe.
0,Justin knew the cause of Sean’s confusion.
0,He was surprised by her weight.
0,Sean carried her down the hallway and returned with a hand towel and a pair of wool socks.
0,"He soaked both in cold water in the sink, wrung them out, and returned down the hall."
0,Justin cursed himself for his inability to help Eydis.
0,"He could not even begin to understand what happened or why Eydis collapsed, but he knew he was the cause."
0,It happened after whatever it was that she did to him to remove his migraine.
1,Sean cleaned the bathroom and placed the soiled shirt into Justin’s laundry after lightly rinsing it.
0,He then returned and pulled up a chair next to Justin.
0,"“So, what happened?”"
0,Justin knew that he could no longer hide everything from Sean.
0,The only question was how much he needed to tell.
0,Justin told Sammy everything because having a fellow woman with whom Eydis could openly communicate was beneficial.
0,"He had refrained from telling Sean the truth out of fear that Sean would contact the authorities, but now he had little choice."
0,"There were parts of Eydis’s background that Justin still felt should be withheld, but Sean at least deserved to know Eydis’s true origins."
0,Justin began his explanation with his migraine and how whatever Eydis did to him placed them both in their respective conditions.
0,"He then brought up Eydis’s otherworldly elven origins, but he decided to leave out the assassination attempt that brought her to their world."
0,“I assume Sammy knows everything as well?
0,I knew something was up between you and Eydis that you weren’t telling me.
0,The walls of this apartment are not exactly soundproof.
0,"I heard jumbled bits and pieces whenever you talked in private, but I could never piece it together."
0,I never thought it would be this bizarre.”
0,“Just don’t tell anyone.
0,Dr. Shuman and Sammy are the only others who know the truth.”
0,Sean bopped his fist on Justin’s forehead.
0,“Who do you take me for?”
0,"“You know, I am recovering from a migraine.” "
0,Sean smiled and bopped Justin again.
0,“I thought she cured you.”
0,"“As you can see, I’m still not in perfect condition.” "
0,Sean sat back in his chair and folded his arms.
0,“How long until you can move again?”
0,"“Eydis collapsed before she could say anything, but I can move my fingers a little now, so I might be able to move by morning."
0,I hope…”
0,"“Then that just leaves one question, should I get you an empty bottle or would you rather me pick you up a diaper?” "
0,There was no grin on his face.
0,Sean’s statement held the same austere aura that radiated from him at all times.
0,"He appeared as if at Justin’s request, he would head to the nearest 24-hour mart to pick up an adult diaper, but having lived with Sean for two years, Justin could easily recognize Sean’s dry form of sarcasm."
0,“Very funny.”
0,Sean stood and returned the chair to the table.
0,"“I’ll keep an eye on Eydis, so get some sleep.”"
0,"Of all the men that Justin knew, Sean was the only one he would trust completely to not lay his hands on Eydis."
0,"Thinking back to when he was sexualizing Eydis’s trauma before knowing the truth, Justin trusted Sean more than he would trust himself."
0,"Laughing silently, Justin closed his eyes and found it easy to drift off to sleep."
1,"Justin woke before sunrise and found that he could move, albeit sluggishly."
0,He felt like his body was reacting a full second after he attempted to move it.
0,The second hand on the clock in the living room also moved far slower than it should.
0,"Clearly his body had not fully recovered, so Justin decided to close his eyes and sleep for another hour or two, or however long his body would let it."
1,"When Justin woke again, faint morning light peaked through the cracks in the horizontal blinds."
0,"Unlike the dreamlike state he woke in a few hours earlier, his body moved normally."
0,"After pulling off the blankets, Justin stood on his feet and found that his legs supported him but were very weak."
0,"This was no different than the weakness he usually felt after a bad migraine, so he was not alarmed."
0,He made his way down the hall to his room where he found Eydis sleeping soundly.
0,Sean slept in the desk chair set beside the bed.
0,He held a hand towel that he had likely placed on Eydis’s forehead to help drop her fever.
0,Justin tapped Sean on the shoulder.
0,Sean looked up with groggy eyes at Justin.
0,“I’ll take it from here.
0,Go to bed.”
0,Sean nodded and hobbled out of the room.
0,Eydis continued sleeping through the morning and did not stir until the early afternoon but only to shift positions and continue sleeping.
0,"Her fever dropped, although she still felt warm."
0,Sean returned after his afternoon classes to check up on her and left once he saw she was recovering.
0,The only words he spoke were to ask Justin not to tell Eydis that he had helped her.
0,Justin smiled to himself seeing the contrast between Sean’s serious front and his kindness.
0,"Sean was a hard worker, and so he held strong opinions against freeloading and handouts."
0,He always pushed Eydis to situate herself and earn her way solely because he did care and felt it best for her.
0,"Whatever happened to her in the past, Sean wanted Eydis to grow past it and become stronger for it."
0,Eydis opened her eyes shortly after the sun set.
0,"After locating Justin sitting beside her, her lips slowly parted."
0,“Are you feeling better now?”
0,Justin felt anger well up in him.
0,It took him by surprise.
0,"He could not tell if his anger was directed at Eydis, himself, or anyone at all."
0,The whole situation was preposterous.
0,"He had a migraine, something he was used to and could endure as he had many times in the past, and then without his consent, Eydis healed him but ended up with a high fever that kept her bedridden all day in his stead."
0,It was like she took his illness upon herself.
0,What was the purpose of all this?
0,“Why’d you do that?” 
0,"Justin voiced his thoughts without thinking, the words sounding in his ears as if someone else had spoken them."
0,"He knew he sounded ungrateful, but he could not take them back."
0,Eydis sat up in the bed with a stern face that leaned on the side of anger.
0,“You saved me from the cold.
0,You gave me a place to live.
0,You are hiding me from people who want to kill me.
0,You protect my secret.
0,You feed me.
0,"And I, what have I done for you?"
0,Pick out food?
0,Elves have a saying.” Eydis paused for a moment to think about the translation.
0,"“When shown kindness, pay it back twice."
0,I have much to pay back.”
0,“I didn’t do any of that expecting you to repay me.
0,You did not have to harm yourself to help me.”
0,Eydis smiled.
0,“Then think this way .
0,"If you do not get better or die, I lose place to live."
0,I lose place to hide.
0,I lose you who knows my secret.
0,I lose you who feeds me.
0,"If you do not like me paying back kindness, then I did it for me, not you.” "
0,Eydis folded her arms to add the final punctuation to her argument.
0,Justin had no ammo to refute what she said and raised his hands in defeat.
0,"“Then thank you,” Justin  replied with an exasperated smile."
0,“How about this?
0,You can also pay me back by telling me what on earth you did.”
0,Eydis sat in thought for a few minutes.
0,“I cannot explain well.
0,"You were sick… No, not sick."
0,You were poisoned.” Her eyes looked above her as if visualizing the question mark hanging over her head.
0,"Justin’s mind ran circles around everything he did the previous day, everything he ate."
0,"If there was poison in any of the food, Justin thought that Eydis would have noticed with her keen ability to detect both quality and safety."
0,"Or perhaps there was food that Justin ate periodically that is safe for most people but his body reacts aversely to, causing his migraines."
0,An intolerance or allergy?
0,"Following this train of thought, Justin began recalling what he had eaten over the past few days."
0,Eydis noticed his internal contemplation and placed her hand on his wrist to pull him out.
0,She followed with an explanation.
0,"“Ven, the energy used for magic, is everywhere."
0,"Bodies take in ven, turn it into something we can use."
0,"It is very rare, but sometimes a person’s body is not good at this."
0,"Some ven is changed wrong, becomes poison."
0,"When your body is full of ven, extra ven your body takes in escapes."
0,Poison ven makes escape hard or stops it.
0,"When full of only poison ven, poison must escape and causes pain and sickness.”"
0,“Ven?
0,Is that like mana from video games?
0,Mana poisoning?” 
0,"Justin could not use magic, but from Eydis’s explanation, his body must still absorb ven like hers but is poor at it, making it toxic."
0,"His periodic migraines could be explained if every two to three months, the ven poisoning backup peaked."
0,“Sorry for hurting you.
0,"Normally when poison ven grows too much, your body expels it, like vomit, and the pain goes away."
0,Your poison ven was not escaping.
0,It was very dangerous.
0,"If bad, you could die."
0,"I pushed it out, all your ven, gone."
0,Having no ven is also bad.
0,Bodies need ven.
0,"Without ven, your body weakens and also might die."
0,"With no poison ven, you were empty, so I gave you all of mine.”"
0,Justin recalled how Eydis was breathing heavier than normal and was sweating and shivering when she changed his shirt and lifted him onto the couch.
0,“All…?
0,"Didn’t you just say being out of ven was bad, that you could die?”"
0,Eydis’s eyes fell to her lap.
0,“Normally I would be fine.
0,I have trained my body to survive no ven.
0,"I take in ven fast, but it is hard in this world."
0,Ven here is strange.
0,"I must change it different than ven in my world, so it is slow."
0,"With no ven, my body got weak, made me sleep to focus on getting more ven.”"
0,Eydis looked down at her lap with her cheeks puffed in a childish pout that looked to Justin as if she had lost a contest she knew she would win.
0,"“I was not going to give you all my ven, just enough to help you."
0,"But your container is large, very large."
0,I felt it… It was…” Eydis bit her lower lip.
0,"“No, four or five of me, maybe more.” "
0,"After a small shake of her head, she continued."
0,"“With full container, magic is easy."
0,Less in container makes magic hard.
0,One fourth of container and magic stops without forcing it.
0,Body is in danger at one sixth of container or less.
0,"I kept giving you ven, but you were still in danger."
0,You needed all my ven.
0,"Even with all, I was worried."
0,It was not enough… Not even close… Your container is too large.”
0,“I can’t use magic.
0,How is my capacity bigger than yours?”
0,“Your… capacity?” Eydis’s eyes lit up at the discovery of a new word.
0,“Your capacity is big maybe because of poison ven.
0,"Ven your body takes in cannot escape because of poison, and it stretches capacity until it must escape."
0,"We train capacity by stopping escape the same way, but we do not let it become bad like with poison ven, so it takes a long time."
0,"For you, poison ven always grows, stops escape, and stretches capacity.”"
0,“Is there any way to stop my body from converting the ven wrong?”
0,“There is no cure.
0,Bring your head close.”
0,Eydis beckoned with her hand for Justin to come near.
0,She then placed her hands on his cheeks and pulled his head towards hers until their foreheads touched.
0,Justin could feel blood rushing to his face.
0,He could feel the tickle from the breath of the beautiful woman.
0,"He then felt a brief tinge of pressure in his head, but it was not enough that he would call it painful."
0,"Eydis released her grasp on Justin’s face, and they both sat back in their respective positions."
0,"“Poison ven was there, but very small amount."
0,Could you feel how I push it out?”
0,Justin shook his head.
0,"“I just felt a little pain, that’s it.”"
0,"“Poison ven is bad, so you must learn to push it out yourself."
0,A body full of good ven is healthy.
0,"If you use magic, good ven is used first."
0,"If you take in more ven and some becomes poison, poison ven grows."
0,"If you have no good ven, then poison ven is used for magic and is very, very painful."
0,Removing poison ven without using it is much less painful.
0,I will help you learn to remove poison ven.”
0,“Help me learn?
0,How?
0,I can’t use magic.”
0,“Not magic.
0,Your body.
0,I will push out poison ven for you each day so your body can feel how.
0,And you do not know if you cannot do magic.
0,"You did not know about ven, what ven feels like, how to use it."
0,"I will show you too, but first you need to know what magic you can use."
0,"I can only use wind magic, life magic, and…” "
0,"Eydis looked around her bed, and Justin knew what she was searching for."
0,He walked over to his desk to retrieve Eydis’s smartphone.
0,He sat silent for a few minutes as Eydis searched.
0,"Like usual, Eydis became oblivious to the passage of time, so Justin left the room to cook dinner."
0,"Twenty minutes later, he returned with both his and Eydis’s plates, and yet Eydis still had not found the word she was looking for."
0,“Transport.
0,Portal.
0,Barrier.
0,Wall.
0,No word for all this.” 
0,"Eydis voiced her frustration before tossing a piece of popcorn chicken into her mouth, ignoring the homemade barbecue sauce Justin had prepared with it."
0,“Hold on.
0,You can make portals?
0,You can teleport?” Justin could not believe what he was hearing.
0,"“If that’s the case, how are you stuck in this world?"
0,Shouldn’t you be able to go back?”
0,Eydis looked at Justin with a blank stare and mouth agape.
0,She grew angry.
0,“I am new to this magic.
0,I was not born with it.
0,It came when I grew to a woman.
0,My teacher who sent me here was the best at portal magic!
0,I do not know magic to move to other worlds!
0,That magic is much more than me!”
0,Justin scrambled to keep both his and Eydis’s plates from falling to the floor from her outburst.
0,"“I get it, I get it."
0,As for what to call it… use the word spatial.”
0,"Eydis’s eyes lit up again at the new word she could not find, her excitement erasing any trace of her outburst."
0,"“Yes, spatial magic."
0,"I can use wind magic, life magic, and spatial magic."
0,Give me your hand.”
0,"Already holding his plate in one hand, Justin tossed the two pieces of popcorn chicken in his other hand into his mouth and extended it."
0,Eydis adjusted the position so that his palm faced upwards.
0,"She moved her hand, palm downward, about an inch above his."
0,“Do you feel something?”
0,“What am I supposed to feel?” Justin asked after swallowing.
0,“Now do you feel something?”
0,Justin felt nothing more than the faint radiant heat of Eydis’s hand.
0,"A third time Eydis asked, and again Justin felt nothing."
0,"“I sent life ven, wind ven, and spatial ven below my hand."
0,"If you feel nothing, then maybe you cannot use same magic as me."
0,"There are other magic, like fire magic, water magic, and earth magic, but I cannot test if you can use them."
0,I cannot make ven for those magic.
0,You must learn yourself.
0,Or maybe you can use no magic… That is common for humans…” 
0,Eydis tossed another piece of popcorn chicken into her mouth and pouted again.
0,“But that wastes large capacity.”
0,"Chapter 13
“Hands-on Learning”
Eydis"
1,Eydis woke not to the sunlight through the windows of her large guest room in the west wing of the imperial palace but to the sounds of scraping and gargled whimpers coming from the metal crate against the far wall from her bed.
0,"Jethro had instructed her to raise a peculiar little creature in her room by feeding it blood each day, and this was the morning of the fifth day."
0,The light filtering through the parts in the blue curtains showed that the sun would soon peak over the horizon.
0,Eydis pulled the large blankets of her bed back over her head to muffle the noise from the crate.
0,It was only yesterday that the creature had begun making any sound.
0,A loud yip-like bark pierced through the blankets and into Eydis’s sharp ears.
0,"She wanted to continue sleeping, but a pungent metallic odor crept into Eydis’s nose as the light of the morning sun scattered rainbow sparks through the crystalline windows."
0,"Like the four days previous, as soon as the sun rose, a cup of blood appeared on the small table beside her bed."
0,"The smell was musty, not unlike mold, and made her nose itch and threaten to sneeze."
0,The yips from the creature inside the crate grew louder and more aggressive the longer Eydis stalled.
0,"It learned the time it got fed, or it could smell the blood."
0,"Either way, if Eydis wanted any peace, she had to eliminate the smell and silence the creature."
0,Eydis removed the blankets and turned to place her feet on the cold woolen carpet.
0,"After stretching her arms behind her back and breathing a great yawn, she retrieved the cup with one hand covering her nose."
0,"The closer she got to the crate, the louder the creature became."
0,"When she slowly poured the blood into the funnel on the corner, the noises of the creature ceased."
0,All that could be heard was the lapping of a small tongue that had not been there previously.
0,"Over the next few days, the high-pitched yips became deep barks and howls."
0,"To Eydis’s keen ears, it sounded no different than the hounds that she used to hear around the palace."
0,The creature stopped crying for the blood that Eydis gave it each morning and instead waited patiently.
0,Her days of seclusion in her room would have been peaceful if not for the howling at night that prevented any deep sleep.
1,"On the fifteenth day, the smell of the blood changed."
0,It assaulted her nose with a rotten odor that jolted her awake before the sun had the chance.
0,"Eydis rushed out of bed, grabbed the cup, and poured its contents into the crate, but try as she might, Eydis could not rid her sinuses of the smell of rotten food and spoiled milk that squeezed tears from the corners of her eyes."
0,"She was grateful the cup disappeared as soon as she returned it to the bedside table, but the smell still lingered in her sinuses for most of the morning."
0,"For the next four days, Eydis was woken by the rotten odor."
0,"The hound-like howls ceased, and the barks grew high in pitch back to the yips they once were and then closer to a squeal."
0,The silencing of the howls did not improve Eydis’s sleep.
0,The creature slept during the day and was awake and scratching at the walls of the crate each night.
0,The effects of Eydis’s lack of sleep over the past fifteen days began to show.
0,"Try as she might, she could not get her body to change its sleep schedule and let her sleep during the day."
0,Hours were spent lying in bed staring up at the canopy.
0,"She used simple life magic to keep the shadows under her eyes from showing and to keep her skin on her face from sagging, but with each day she grew more and more tired, more and more frustrated."
0,Why has Jethro not appeared?
0,What am I to learn from raising this thing in a metal box?
0,How long am I to continue this?
0,"Eydis grabbed a piece of parchment from the desk in the corner of the room, wrote her questions, and placed it on the table."
0,"The parchment disappeared immediately, seemingly falling through the polished wood into the table, and was replaced with a reply appearing in a flash of light like a spark."
0,“We are entering the final stages.
0,Only a few more days.”
0,Eydis tore the tough parchment in her hand and let it drift to the floor.
0,"She was too tired to be angry, too tired to think."
0,"She spent the rest of the day in a daze, letting her mind draw her into whatever action took its fancy, which only amounted to pacing around the room, playing with her tail, or lying in bed."
1,The next day the blood changed once again.
0,This time the smell was benign compared to the other two but still unsettling.
0,Eydis breathed a sigh of relief and prayed that this time the creature would become more tolerable.
0,"She was unsure, but the actions of the creature seemed to change with the blood she gave it, and because the blood was not pungent, perhaps the creature would mellow out."
0,Eydis’s dazed mind found herself staring at the blood in the cup as she carried it over.
0,She wondered what it came from.
0,"The smell of iron still hung thick in her nose, but at the same time, she was not averse to it."
0,"Compared to the moldy scent of the first and the rotten odor of the second, the blood in the cup smelled of herbs."
0,"When she brought it over to the crate, she found herself hesitating to pour it in."
0,She stared at it with blank eyes as red slowly filled her vision.
0,A sudden clang from inside the crate returned Eydis to her senses.
0,She realized what she was doing.
0,"In fear, she quickly dumped it into the funnel, nearly spilling it over the edges."
0,Something was wrong with her.
0,She did not want to give it to the creature.
0,She wanted it instead.
0,This alien thought combined with her lack of sleep dropped Eydis to her knees.
0,Her ears could hear the creature drink the blood inside the crate.
0,The sound was deafening.
0,"She covered her ears quickly with twitching, anxious fingers, but her mind could still hear the sound."
0,She screamed out.
0,“What is wrong with me!?”
0,"Eydis ran to the desk and pulled out the drawer containing the parchment, snapping off the handle in her haste."
0,She penned out a complaint of the torturous treatment she had been receiving and demanded it to end.
0,"When she placed her message on the table, the only reply she received was, “Keep feeding it.”"
0,This was an order.
0,This had to be some long-term torture Jethro devised to break her mentally.
0,The Amelian Empire lost the war.
0,It was no more.
0,"She was the sole survivor of the royal family, and she was in the hands of the enemy’s general."
0,Was he toying with her for his amusement?
0,For what purpose was she being subjected to this torture?
0,What was so important that she had to suffer this in order to learn?
0,Was it only to show his dominance over her?
0,Was it because of her defiance during their former daily meetings?
0,"If that was his purpose, Eydis refused to give in."
0,She would not become Jethro’s broken pet.
1,"In protest, the next morning Eydis did not feed the creature."
0,She left the cup on the table and sat in the furthest corner from both the crate and the cup of blood.
0,The aroma of the blood attacked her senses.
0,"She found it unpleasant, but her heart still raced."
0,"She bit the inside of her cheek until it bled to keep her mind off the smell, masking it in the taste of her own blood."
0,"When steam no longer rose from the cup, it was replaced by another fresh cup."
0,"After the cup was replaced for the third time, the unfed creature began to whimper, but the sound was unlike any noise the creature had previously made."
0,The cries had tonal changes to them and were more babble than the shrill cries of the past days.
0,They were otherworldly and only grew in intensity as time went by.
0,Eydis cried in her corner but did not want to give in.
0,"The longer she held off feeding the creature, the louder it became."
0,I will not give in.
0,I will not!
0,A shrill screech from the creature sent chills through her body.
0,She ran and jumped completely over her large bed to the table.
0,"Cup in hand, she cleared the long distance from her bed to the crate in only three strides, spilling drops of blood onto the pristine white carpet."
0,"Once the blood was poured into the crate, the horrid sounding cries ceased and were replaced by the wet slurping of the creature drinking its meal."
0,Eydis walked slowly back to the table.
0,"She watched the cup vanish as all the others had, but this time, the vanishing cup was agonizing rather than relieving."
0,She curled up against the side of her bed and cried.
0,She had given in.
0,"She didn’t want to, but she had succumbed to her own weakness."
0,She stayed in that position for the remainder of the day and through the night wondering what more Jethro would make her do now that he knew she would become obedient if pressured enough.
0,She held the tip of her tail at her side like a safety blanket and waited out the torturous night.
1,"The next morning before the cup appeared, Eydis heard mumbling from the crate."
0,It was high pitched and mixed with coughs and snarls.
0,"When the sun peaked over the purple horizon, the cup appeared, and immediately the creature screamed."
0,"It thrashed inside the crate, and from the sound, there was little room for the creature to move."
0,This further infuriated it.
0,"With a deep breath and another shrill cry, a bulge grew on the crate from an impact within."
0,Eydis rushed the cup over to the crate and poured in the blood.
0,She no longer had the will to resist Jethro’s demands.
0,She would feed the creature as ordered.
0,"The cries ceased, but the creature continued hitting the walls of the crate, although without the same force or ferocity."
0,"To prevent a repeat of the previous day’s drama, Eydis waited at the table for the appearance of the cup."
0,"The moment it appeared, Eydis rushed it to the crate and poured it in."
0,"The cries stopped and the room fell silent, but later that day the creature began speaking."
0,"It babbled nonsensical sounds, but they were distinctly sapient."
0,"As the incoherent speech continued, it grew angrier and angrier until the creature assaulted the walls of its small enclosure."
0,The next day the assault did not stop once the creature was fed.
0,The number of bulges in the crate grew.
0,Eydis did everything within her power to appease the creature.
0,She tried talking to it.
0,She tried singing to it.
0,But it was not enough.
0,It only grew angrier.
0,“What more do you want?!”
0,Eydis screamed.
0,The creature responded by hitting the very center of the side of the crate facing her.
0,"The bulge it created was far larger than any previous impact, buckling the seam in the center of both the top and bottom edge."
0,Eydis immediately went silent.
0,A second impact created a similarly large bulge on the top of the crate.
0,The former opening that had been welded shut grew a small crack.
0,Eydis held her breath.
0,"Much to her relief, the creature did not notice."
0,How long will the crate hold?
0,What happens if it breaks?
0,Only a monster of terrible power could bend and stretch metal with so little room for movement.
0,"Eydis huddled back in the furthest corner of the room and watched with wide, sleep-deprived eyes through the night."
0,She could not find the courage to blink for fear of something happening when her eyes closed.
0,"Her eyes burned from lack of moisture, but still she watched."
1,"By morning, the cries had not stopped nor had the internal attack on the crate."
0,"When the cup appeared, Eydis ran with all haste to give it to the creature, but when she reached the crate, the creature hit the corner with the funnel."
0,"The funnel snapped off, bouncing once on the white carpet."
0,The corner seam split open where the funnel attached.
0,This did not go unnoticed by the creature.
0,"It hit the same location again, and the tear in the seam grew."
0,"Fingers shot out the opening, long, slender, hairy fingers with knotted knuckles."
0,"Eydis dropped the cup, spilling the creature’s meal on the floor."
0,The smell from the inside of the crate was so foul it made Eydis gag.
0,She staggered back.
0,"The fingers spasmed and thrashed at the opening in the metal amidst shrill rambling cries, and the tear slowly grew."
0,Eydis ran panicked to the desk for the quill.
0,The parchment tore in her hand as she penned a plea for help so hard that the quill split and marred the polished finish of the desk.
0,"She placed it on the table, her eyes glued to the hand protruding from the metal."
0,"The message disappeared, but no reply came."
0,"Another strong impact, and the corner of the crate bent further."
0,A long slender arm with matted hair on the outer side extended through the opening.
0,The odor of the arm that swung wildly and clawed at the air stung her eyes and nose.
0,Eydis hid in the small gap between her bed and side table.
0,She could not control her shaking body and pulled a blanket off her bed for what meager cover or comfort--she was not sure which she wanted more--it might provide.
0,"In its swinging, the arm struck the wall behind the crate."
0,"The creature jammed its claws into the marble with impossible strength, chipping off part of the wall."
0,This created a hold that the creature used to pull up that side of the crate.
0,"With enough leverage, the crate tipped on its end, standing vertical."
0,A push off the wall sent the crate careening forward onto the ground.
0,The stain of blood on the carpet was now near the opening.
0,Eydis shrieked.
0,A face appeared in the opening.
0,It had clearly elven features but was hairy with fangs and a long tongue.
0,"Its tongue lashed out of the opening, but despite its length it could not reach the bloodstained carpet."
0,This infuriated the creature.
0,"The monster thrashed, clawed, and kicked at the opening amid shrill, angry cries."
0,"Slowly the opening widened, and the monster stuck its head out of the crate."
0,A matted mane ran from the top of its head down its neck.
0,"Its pointed ears sitting high on the sides of its head could belong to an elf, but there was something distinctly rodent about them."
0,The monster extended itself as far as possible out of the opening but was stopped by its shoulders.
0,Its long tongue could just barely touch the bloodstain.
0,"Instead of growing angry, the creature grabbed the opening with its hand and pushed."
0,Little by little the metal bent outwards.
0,Its arm and shoulder slid through.
0,"Grabbing the other side with its other hand, it bent the metal further."
0,Eydis could not speak.
0,She could not breathe.
0,Any action she took she feared would make the creature notice her.
0,The only sound was the rapid beating of her terrified heart.
0,"Tears grew in her eyes, and she even feared their fall would attract its attention."
0,Someone… please…
0,The monster bent the metal enough to pull its other arm and shoulder out.
0,"It shifted its body back and forth, sliding out the opening until it was free."
0,"There stood a man, naked and covered in patches of matted, light-brown fur on his back from his head to his long, slender tail."
0,"He had the gruesome appearance of an elf fused with a hound, but his hands, feet, and tail were like a rodent."
0,Fecal matter was smeared on his body.
0,"Not only did her eyes sting, but she could also taste it in the air."
0,"Free from his prison, the monster attacked the blood on the carpet with his teeth and tongue, sucking up what it could."
0,Eydis watched in fearful silence as the hair on his arms and legs lessened and the digits on his hands and feet shrunk slightly.
0,Light flashed beside Eydis.
0,The tears Eydis had been struggling to hold back fell at the sight of Jethro.
0,She pleaded in silence for him to save her.
0,"“He grew nice and big,” Jethro said, glancing down at Eydis, completely unfazed by Eydis’s distress and the smell in the room."
0,"Seeing that Jethro’s voice did not draw the monster’s attention, Eydis found the courage to speak."
0,“What… what is th-that thing?”
0,"“An Alukah, or as close as I could get to making one."
0,"Looks similar to a lycon, does it not?”"
0,“Did that w-w-worm… that th-thing… it turned in-into th-this?” Eydis’s jaw shook uncontrollably.
0,“The peculiar little creature is called a Lurr.
0,"I had you feed it blood from the hounds in the palace, a rodent of unusual size found in the northern highland swamps of the Tolmyur Kingdom, and some High Elves."
0,"Of course, I was also placing food in the crate."
0,It could not have gotten that big on blood alone.” Jethro chuckled.
0,"“Although, I was rather busy of late playing with the fairies, so I neglected to feed it over the past few days.”"
0,Eydis stared at Jethro in horror.
0,The anger the Alukah had exhibited was from starvation.
0,"She looked back at the monster that was licking the carpet but could no longer find any blood, or at least enough to satisfy it."
0,"It turned to Jethro and Eydis, now noticing their presence, and charged."
0,Eydis screamed and climbed over the bed as the Alukah dove at Jethro.
0,"Jethro waved his hand, and the beast was hurled back into the crate which buckled from the impact."
0,"Unfazed, the Alukah charged again."
0,"This time, the beast could not get close."
0,An invisible wall blocked its way.
0,The Alukah snarled and screamed in a futile attempt to claw away the barrier.
0,Jethro peered down at Eydis peaking from behind the far side of the bed.
0,“Your lesson starts now.”
0,The Alukah clawed at the barrier but quickly lost interest.
0,"Looking around, it spotted Eydis hiding behind the bed."
0,It found a new target and lunged.
0,"Eydis expected Jethro’s barrier to stop it, but the Alukah approached unhindered."
0,"It slid on the bed, got caught on a blanket, and rolled off on top of Eydis."
0,Eydis screamed and pushed the beast away.
0,She ran to the other side of the room and pleaded to Jethro.
0,“Do something!”
0,"The Alukah scrambled to right itself, but its erratic movements only served to further entangle it in the blanket."
0,"Jethro flashed a crooked, dimpled smile."
0,"“The palace hounds are highly aggressive, and it takes a lot of training to curb their violent tendencies."
0,Elves are highly intelligent.
0,The rodents… I simply used them to help attain the look I was hoping for.
0,"And to be honest, I did not want it to look too much like a lycon."
0,Personal reasons.
0,I hope you understand.”
0,Understand what?!
0,Eydis wanted to scream.
0,"With the sound of tearing, the beast reduced the blanket to scraps of fabric."
0,"“When Lurr evolve, more than just their appearance changes."
0,"They not only take on the natures of what they feed on, but those natures are also enhanced.”"
0,"Now free of the blanket, the Alukah ran towards Eydis."
0,"She tried to flee, but it caught her arms and pinned her on the ground."
0,"Its mouth watered, dripping saliva on her neck."
0,Jethro sat cross-legged on the bedside table and chuckled wryly.
0,“He looks hungry.”
0,Why is he doing this?
0,What would he gain?
0,Is this just crude entertainment for him?
0,Jethro’s statement when he first gave Eydis the creature came to mind like a wraith whispering in her ear.
0,“The real entertainment is yet to come.”
0,Eydis wrenched her right arm free and pushed against the Alukah’s face.
0,"In frustration, the Alukah glared at Eydis with its blood-red eyes and bit down on her wrist."
0,She channeled wind magic into her hand in the jaws of the beast and expelled it with all the force she could.
0,The blades of wind lacerated the side of the beast’s head.
0,It released its hold and staggered back.
0,"Now free, Eydis scrambled to her feet, her legs weak and shaking from fear."
0,Jethro chuckled.
0,“Realized now that you could fight?
0,Your flight instincts are far too strong.” 
0,"The Alukah wiped his hand down the side of his face, and the bleeding stopped."
0,"“Oh, and Lurr can instinctively use the magic of the species from which it feeds.” "
0,"“And life magic is common to High Elves,” Eydis mumbled."
0,She channeled life ven into her left hand and rubbed her wrist to stop the bleeding and kill any infection that might have come from the bite.
0,The Alukah charged with a snarl.
0,Eydis rushed to erect a makeshift barrier in front of her.
0,"The force of the Alukah’s impact into the barrier pushed Eydis, and she stumbled and fell to her back."
0,"The Alukah tried to pin her again, but Eydis had wind ven ready and thrust a wind spear through the beast’s side."
0,She then used a barrier to push the beast off her and scrambled back to her feet.
0,Eydis was breathing heavily.
0,She was exhausted from lack of sleep and could feel her ven levels running low.
0,"Again, the Alukah stopped the bleeding in its side."
0,"He stared at Eydis with bloodshot, red eyes and bellowed an earsplitting, almost elven scream."
0,He picked up the heavy wooden chair at the desk and hurled it with all his strength.
0,"Eydis barely managed to erect a barrier in time, and the one she created with the little ven she had was insufficient to stop the chair."
0,"The impact knocked Eydis back against the wall, but she was unharmed."
0,"Seeing the chair have no effect, the Alukah picked up the entire desk and hurled it next."
0,Eydis dove to the side and threw another wind spear at the beast.
0,The spear hit its mark but did no more than create a minor puncture in the Alukah’s stomach.
0,It lacked any force.
0,She was out of usable ven.
0,Eydis could not draw upon enough for another spell.
0,She had not trained to use ven below dangerous levels.
0,"Panic rose in Eydis’s chest, but the feeling was interrupted by a familiar, unpleasant metallic aroma."
0,In Jethro’s hand was another cup of blood.
0,"“If you want some ven back, feel free.”"
0,Eydis’s heart raced with a new sensation different than panic.
0,"Biting her cheek, she ignored the feeling and faced the Alukah."
0,The Alukah took notice of the cup but continued to focus on the larger prey.
0,It knew that Eydis could no longer cast any magic.
0,It charged.
0,"Eydis dodged to the side, but the beast was faster."
0,It swung its arm and hit Eydis in the stomach.
0,The impact threw her back against the far wall.
0,The marble cracked from the force.
0,Eydis retched air and blood as she fell to the ground.
0,"Very shaken with her lower ribs broken, she stood back on her feet."
0,"“That hit alone probably would have killed me instantly, let alone the impact on the wall.” Jethro poured himself a cup of the bitter brown tea."
0,“You are fairly resilient.
0,I am rather jealous.
0,Oh!
0,Did I mention that Lurr also have superior physical ability compared to the prey they feed on?
0,You probably do not want to get hit like that…”
0,"The Alukah ran at Eydis and kicked her back into the wall, splitting cracks across the wall’s full length."
0,“…again…” Jethro sighed.
0,The Alukah grabbed Eydis by the neck and lifted her.
0,He slammed her into the wall.
0,Small chunks of marble fell from the widening cracks.
0,The Alukah’s face twisted from the frustration that the wall was breaking faster than his prey.
0,"Eydis could not breathe, and in her shaken mind, she knew that she would not survive another impact or two."
0,She grabbed the beast’s arm with both hands and dug her fingers in as tight as she could.
0,Her fingers penetrated its skin and dug into flesh with relative ease.
0,Eydis gripped harder and twisted.
0,"With two cracks, the Alukah’s arm broke, releasing his grip on Eydis’s throat."
0,Eydis dropped to the ground and dove into the beast while screaming in anger.
0,They both tumbled backwards to the ground.
0,Eydis balled her fists and pummeled the Alukah’s face with a flurry of ill-formed punches.
0,"Her fingers grew rigid, and she scraped and clawed in frantic motions."
0,The Alukah grabbed Eydis by her hair and threw her off.
0,She landed on her back next to the large metal crate.
0,"The beast staggered to his feet, his jaw shattered and bent into itself."
0,Most of the flesh was missing from his face.
0,"He turned to Eydis to retaliate, but his gaze slowly rose above her."
0,She held the crate high by the torn opening in the corner.
0,"Screaming with all her might, she swung the crate down."
0,The impact flattened the Alukah to the ground.
0,"When the Alukah tried to stand, Eydis swung the crate down with all her strength."
0,She swung it down again and again.
0,Again.
0,Again.
0,Again.
0,Eydis continued until the sky outside the windows grew red from the sunset and she had no more strength to lift the heavy metal.
0,The flattened crate fell to the floor with a clang.
0,"She still held onto it with one hand, her fingers having gripped so tight that they bent the metal to match their form."
0,"She was panting and shaking, staring at the remains of the beast."
0,"In place of the monster was mangled, bloody gore."
0,No part of the splattered mound resembled the creature it once was.
0,"Coming to her senses, she remembered Jethro."
0,She found him sitting cross-legged on her bed enjoying his dinner of steak with wine.
0,"“GAAAAAHHHHH!” Anger welled, and Eydis charged."
0,But she did not reach him.
1,Eydis found herself looking up at the ceiling of a different room.
0,"Her chest burned, and she vomited blood."
0,"Around her, broken marble scattered from the remains of a wall."
0,“The control is much better than expected now.” Jethro examined the destroyed wall as he stepped through.
0,“I should reward Emer for explaining the trick to stabilize the force.
0,"If I had this when fighting the first princess, my job would have been finished that night.”"
0,Jethro stood over Eydis.
0,"His face expressed honest concern, which struck Eydis as odd given the harrowing experience he had just put her through."
0,“There is something I want you to see.” 
0,Jethro created a portal that opened to itself above Eydis.
0,"When she looked into it, she could see herself."
0,Eydis began to hyperventilate.
0,Tears ran down her face.
0,What she saw had to be a lie.
0,That was not her face.
0,Those were not her eyes.
0,The watery eyes that looked back at her no longer resembled a polished blue-green sapphire.
0,"They glowed a deep blood-red, the same blood-red she had seen in that monster."
0,"“So, what did we learn from this lesson?"
0,Take your time.”
0,"In a raspy, winded voice that bubbled from the blood in her lungs, Eydis mustered a few words."
0,“Am I… What am I?”
0,“You certainly are not a High Elf.”
0,Truth.
0,Eydis’s eyes slowly returned to their natural color as she watched her reflection.
0,"Jethro waved his hand over her, and with the mild pain of being squeezed, the filth of the monster that clung to her body and clothes was pulled away leaving her far cleaner than after a long bath."
0,He then lifted her broken frame with utmost care and carried her to a chair in the center of an adjacent room where an enslaved High Elf was waiting to administer first-aid.
0,The worst pain subsided as Eydis felt her ruptured organs mend.
0,"“But, I am the first princess."
0,How… how can this be?”
0,Jethro began his explanation after taking a seat across from her.
0,"“With the resistance holding onto the hope that the royal bloodline lives, did you truly think that I would leave First Princess Eydis FeAmel of the Amelian Empire alive?”"
0,"Eydis looked at him in disbelief, so he elaborated."
0,“Lurr are creatures that mutate into what they prey on.
0,You are a special kind of Lurr called a doppelganger.” 
0,Truth.
0,"“They are the exact duplicates created by feeding solely on a single individual over a long period of time, and in your case, you were fed the princess’s blood.”"
0,Truth.
0,Eydis still did not want to believe Jethro.
0,"She wanted to doubt her ability to tell truth from lies, but from what she had seen and experienced, even without her ability, she knew Jethro was not lying."
0,“Why did you not just tell me?” Eydis spoke through the tears running down from her dead eyes.
0,“Did I have to go through all that?”
0,"“Even if I was upfront about your identity, do you honestly think that someone who was raised to believe she was the princess would believe an enemy who claimed she was some monster instead?"
0,"Doppelgangers are a dangerous type of Lurr, mainly because they believe they are the original."
0,"If they learn about the original, they become hostile towards it, claiming the original is the fake."
0,"Given the chance, a doppelganger will kill and replace the original by instinct once their evolution matures."
0,"With how much stronger the Lurr is, this creates quite the problem, you see."
0,"To create a safe doppelganger, they must raise it without knowledge of the source."
0,This is why you were restricted to a very specific location in the palace and were not permitted to show yourself.
0,"If others besides your caretakers were in contact with you, you would likely find out about the true princess.”"
0,Eydis recalled the reaction of the elderly maid on the day of the invasion.
0,"“But… but if I am a fake, why did they create me?”"
0,“To sacrifice you.
0,"My guess is that you are the body double for the true princess, a tool to discard in emergencies in order to save her life."
0,"Although, I will say that your existence is quite surprising."
0,Doppelgangers are highly dangerous; very few make use of them.
0,"There have been cases in the past, but only for rulers who were extremely paranoid about their own safety."
0,"For some reason, Emperor Yuro ordered one to be created for his daughter."
0,I am sure his retainers thought him mad.
0,"He wanted to protect her by all means, I am sure."
0,"I would find it amusing if he caught wind of my plans and created you in preparation, but I doubt that was the case given your age."
0,It must have been for some other reason.”
0,"“Are there others… like me, here in the palace?”"
0,“Keeping too many doppelgangers would only multiply the danger.
0,"Emperor Yuro might have had one, but I assassinated him before the Namie could make the swap."
0,"With the original gone, I’m sure the doppelganger was disposed of, if there was one at all."
0,"You survived because they believed the princess escaped, but they very well could have disposed of you, too."
0,"Instead, they chose to use you as a decoy when we assaulted the palace."
0,"For a race that lives as long as they do, spending a year or so to create another is trivial."
0,"If you died, they could just create another once they recovered the princess.”"
0,The conversation of her guards the night of the assassination finally made sense.
0,Eydis felt betrayed.
0,She had thought of Afen as a friend.
0,"Instead, she was just a tool, a monster he was ordered to guard."
0,“This does not mean you have no value.” Jethro continued.
0,"“The princess must supply blood each day or two until your completion, and doing that for years is quite the commitment on her part."
0,Lurr grow quickly the more diverse their prey.
0,"I may have only given you three types of blood to feed the Alukah, but each cup came from a different individual to accelerate the growth."
0,"You see, the more a Lurr mutates into an individual, the less that individual’s blood has any effect on its mutation."
0,"The process of creating you would have taken far less time if they used blood from different elves that looked like the princess, but there are races with extremely keen eyes who could spot the differences, spriggans and Melian dryads for example.”"
0,“What is to come of me now?
0,"Am I too… going to be…?” Now that Eydis knew she was not the true princess, she realized she no longer had any political use."
0,She feared that she would be disposed of as Jethro had mentioned.
0,“I want to make a deal with you.” Jethro replied calmly.
0,“A deal?”
0,Jethro straightened his usually relaxed posture.
0,“I assume that you have realized from the day I found you that I seek your cooperation.
0,"I offer you the opportunity to become the original princess, to be free of your job as her sacrificial double."
0,All we need to do is kill the princess.
0,Only then can you take her place.”
0,"“If I replace the princess, would that not still hinder your desire to silence the resistance?” "
0,“This is where I need your help.
0,I am stuck here trying to track down the surviving wife of the emperor.
0,"She escaped to the fairies in Vallen, but I can still search."
0,"The princess, however, is in a location that I cannot freely move to."
0,She is hiding in another world.
0,"If you can capture her in secret and return her to me, you can live freely in her place in that world, and I will have a body to show the resistance in this one.”"
0,Red color crept into Eydis’s eyes.
0,Why would she ever agree to cooperate with Jethro after what he and his soldiers did to the palace and her people?
0,"Then again, they were not truly her people, were they?"
0,"Of course, they did not know that either."
0,"After a deep and painful breath, Eydis calmed herself."
0,“Why didn’t you just kill me and hand me over to the resistance as proof?
0,Am I not her double?”
0,“Do you want me to kill you?” 
0,"Eydis tensed, realizing the foolishness of her question."
0,"“You are incomplete and will not be complete for another half a year, maybe?"
0,I already mentioned there are those who could spot the subtle differences.
0,"Also, any specialist in life magic who inspects your corpse would discover you are a Lurr, and this empire has both dryads and elves."
0,"Lucky for us, those in the other world cannot use magic from what I hear."
0,There is no risk of you being discovered there.”
0,Red returned to Eydis’s eyes.
0,"She felt the deal was well in her favor, but after the pain Jethro put her and her people through, she did not want him to have his victory."
0,She would not become his submissive pet.
0,"For now, she decided to play along."
0,A grin spread across her face.
0,“I am the true First Princess of the Amelian Empire.
0,I will help you find that imposter.”
0,“Perfect!” Jethro exclaimed with a single loud clap of his hands.
0,“I will teach you everything we know about the other world as well as your nature as a Lurr.
0,I will continue your spatial magic lessons from where we left off.
0,I also have someone who can teach you the language.
,"You are free to keep him in line, and you will probably be required to, to some degree, but do not kill him.”"
0,"Chapter 14
“The Spoils and the Spoiled”
Eydis"
1,"Eydis lay on her stomach atop a long, slender table."
0,"The leather coating of the table repelled any moisture or oil, and the thick woolen padding underneath made the table so comfortable that Eydis nearly fell asleep."
0,"Slender yet firm hands pressed hard into her back, and the warm oil generously applied to them helped those hands slide over her skin to ease her tense muscles."
0,Eydis had never before had a massage.
0,"She did not know if the High Elf slave Jethro gave her was any skilled at it, but the forceful hands pressing deep into knotted tissue squeezed out moans of pleasure from Eydis’s lips, so the slave’s methods could not have been too far wrong."
0,The hands reached Eydis’s ankle and lifted her leg.
0,"The pressure on her ankle was painful, and with a small twist and push into the ball of her foot, her ankle popped."
0,"Due to the thick and heavy chains that were locked around Eydis’s wrists and ankles while she recovered from the damage Jethro had done to her, she was unable to move her feet, and the release of that painful locking pressure sent chills through Eydis’s entire body."
0,Another moan serenated the room.
0,Eydis had been chained to a table for eight days.
0,"She knew Jethro injured her so severely to show his superiority, but she also felt that he went overboard and had no reason to cripple her."
0,She did not doubt he could have easily restrained her in her rage but chose instead to attack.
0,"It was like he gave her that experience to say, “Choose how you want to be treated.” At least he had prepared a highly capable medic to heal her and mend her broken bones, something that was incredibly difficult even for skilled life mages."
0,That same medic was now dipping her hands in oil again and heating them over glowing coals to continue the massage.
0,"She was Eydis’s property, a present from Jethro out of gratitude for her cooperation."
0,"“The reason he kept me chained to a table was to make me all the more grateful for my treatment now,” Eydis mumbled, knowing well that was a lie."
0,"Jethro had not made the order to chain her, at least not directly."
0,"He ordered her medic to do all within her power for Eydis to make a full recovery, and her medic made the decision that Eydis’s injuries were too severe, and so she needed to remain completely immobile until treatment finished."
0,"Aside from the orchestrated fight with that monster and the magic that injured her, magic he only cast because she attacked him, Jethro had treated her well."
0,"He visited her every day of her recovery with honest, heartfelt concern, which aggravated her to no end."
0,"Eydis would have preferred to heal herself and have as little contact with Jethro as possible, but she was unable."
0,The ven she used in her fight during the invasion and against the Alukah never recovered.
0,This was the topic of the first lesson on the Lurr that Jethro gave on his daily visits during Eydis’s recovery.
0,The Lurr do not recover ven naturally like other species.
0,They must drain it from others.
0,This was one of the benefits of Eydis’s massage.
0,"Not only was the slave working out the tension in Eydis’s body, but physical contact also drained ven from the victim at a rate proportional to the amount of contact; however, the drain was no greater than the victim’s natural ven regeneration."
0,It was the slowest method and the only one available to Eydis because she refused the next two.
0,The second most efficient method to drain ven was intercourse.
0,Using sex to recover ven was not unique to Lurr.
0,"During intercourse, the ven of both partners slowly equalized."
0,"If one partner had excess and the other had a shortage, the excess would flow into the lacking partner."
0,The difference for Lurr was that the flow did not stop when equal.
0,A Lurr would take all the ven it could until their partner was empty and unconscious from ven exhaustion.
0,"The strongest form of drain was predation, or in a lighter form, drinking the blood of their prey."
0,"Drinking directly from the source was best, but even drawn blood worked so long as it was fresh and had not sat long enough for the ven inside to disperse."
0,"Fresh blood or predation also had the effect of mutating the Lurr to resemble their prey, which Eydis shuddered to remember having raised the Alukah herself."
0,This option was not possible because her prey was the princess.
0,"If she wanted to drink the princess’s blood, she had to find her first."
0,Any other prey would cause drastic changes to Eydis’s appearance because of the purity of her evolution as a doppelganger.
0,Jethro’s lecture on Lurr only encompassed the first day of her recovery.
0,The remaining seven involved instruction in spatial magic from hardening her barriers and honing them to an edge to a strange new form of instantaneous teleportation called transmission that used less ven than traditional teleportation.
0,Its benefits did come with a few weaknesses.
0,It could only be used on single targets and was rather conspicuous.
0,"It could only send a nearby target to a location, never from some distant location to the caster."
0,"The transmission formulas were incredibly complicated, so much so that Eydis couldn’t even understand the most basic concepts at first."
0,Most of her recovery time was devoted to learning them.
0,Any practice had to wait until she recovered her ven.
0,"At the rate her ven was recovering from the massage, she would have replenished about an eighth of her supply by the time the large bowl of oil ran out, and that would take the majority of the day."
0,It was far too slow.
0,"Large beads of sweat dripped from the slave’s chin by the end of the massage, and her arms quivered in exhaustion from the strenuous work."
0,What little strength remained in those arms bathed Eydis as their final labor for the night.
1,Eydis stretched on a thick rug in front of the fireplace in her new room to dry.
0,She was no longer imprisoned and could now leave her room at her leisure.
0,She could call for any servant or service she desired.
0,This was better treatment than her false father had ever given her.
0,The room was far grander than her two past imprisonments by the emperor and Jethro.
0,The walls were engraved with mountain scenery and overlaid with silver accents.
0,The curtains of the two crystalline windows were likewise woven from silver thread.
0,"The color pallet was rather dull compared to the west wing guest room, but that was perhaps due to the tastes of its former owner."
0,"Apparently, it had belonged to one of the wives of the emperor, not that Eydis cared."
0,Her indoctrination as the false princess had been tossed away now that she knew what she was.
0,She also questioned whether she should keep the name “Eydis” now that she knew she was not the true First Princess of the Amelian Empire.
0,"Names one after the other tumbled around in her mind: Galeiv, Rulen, Sermil, Eyden… Each one felt wrong, but the last felt the least wrong, perhaps due to the similarity to her current name."
0,"When voicing “Eyden” to herself in no more than a whisper, the wrong feeling became physical nausea."
0,Something deep within her was telling her that “Eyden” was not her.
0,"She was “Eydis,” and she could not be called by any other name."
0,"Giving up on renaming herself, or at least postponing the thought until some unknown time in the future, she called her slave."
0,"At Eydis’s order, the slave retrieved the three reports Jethro had prepared for her: information on the missing princess, the current state of the Amelian Empire, and what knowledge they had of the other world."
0,Eydis sat cross-legged by the fireplace and ordered the slave to sit beside her and hold her so she could recover ven as she read.
0,"The Amelian Empire’s court magician and the princess’s instructor, Emer, was drugged and in captivity in northern Tolmyur to extract information on the empire and share his knowledge of magic."
0,"Ceil, the emperor’s surviving wife, was still missing but was last located among the fairies in Vallen."
0,"Genocide of the fairies hiding the wife continued, and an estimated third of the population was expected dead."
0,Eydis felt ill reading the reports on Vallen.
0,"Even though her life until now had been a lie, deep within her she still felt the fairies were her people."
0,Over half the races in the Empire had sworn non-aggression pacts with the Tolmyur Kingdom and were providing all information requested of them with additional sovereign states following by the day.
0,"Resistance groups in Amel were growing due to the lack of government control and leadership, leading to increased crime and poor living conditions."
0,Eydis skimmed through the information only looking at what she could use against the princess.
0,"The state of the Amelian Empire should mean little to her now that she planned to stay in the other world, but she still felt remorse over what had become of the empire she was raised to believe was hers."
0,"The documents on the other world were a confusing mess of assumptions, poor descriptions, and pure fantasy."
0,"Large, metal, automated carriages."
0,Moving paintings.
0,"Eydis found what was written difficult to believe, especially when the report said that magic did not exist."
0,"The city in which the princess was believed to be hiding was populated solely by sotnum, which Eydis did not understand at first."
0,"Thinking back on her education on the races and peoples of her world, she recalled that the sotnum were humans."
0,"If these reports were written for her, Eydis felt they should have used the Amelian names for the races instead of Tolmyurin."
0,"In any case, a land of humans made finding the princess difficult due to human similarity to High Elves."
0,"The population of the city was large, rivaling Amel if not larger, but the city had no walls or military."
0,No armed city guards patrolled at any time of the day or night.
0,It was completely defenseless.
0,"The only reason an invasion had not been planned was due to the fear of an unknown technology or entity powerful enough to remove the need for walls, military, and guards."
0,Eydis leaned back into her slave and set the documents aside.
0,“I am going to live in such a bizarre world?
0,No amount of reading will prepare me for this.”
0,"In addition to practicing her spatial magic, Eydis had to put all her efforts into learning the language of the city, English, because the princess would likely be fluent by the time Eydis arrived."
0,Eydis stood and pulled her slave to her bed.
0,She ordered the slave to disrobe so she could hold her in full body contact throughout the night to recover ven while she slept.
0,Her English lessons would begin the following morning.
1,"* * *
Eydis climbed the white-marble steps to the top floor of the palace with no shortage of unease."
0,"Jethro’s brief description of the human from another world who would teach her English, Austin, left the impression of one who was dangerous or otherwise hard to control."
0,She steeled herself in preparation for their meeting.
0,"She had no idea what to expect from a man from a world with such bizarre magical technology, what he could be capable of."
0,"She stood in wonder before the large and extravagant doors of the former emperor’s chambers, carved from a single massive tree of dark red wood without a single crease or fracture in the woods grain from being cut or fused together."
0,"The door depicted the emperors and empresses of the past, but Eydis did not know their names."
0,This brought the realization that her education as the fake princess was truly lacking.
0,"Her retainers only taught her what was needed to be a double, not act in any real position of power where the history of her people or the knowledge of governance might be required."
0,"The two giants at the door announced her arrival, or so she assumed."
0,The words they used belonged to none of the fourteen political languages she had learned.
0,"A voice on the inside called back, and the two massive guards pulled the doors open with ease as if the heavy wood glided on air."
1,"Eydis had thought her new room regal, but it could not be compared to the grandeur of the emperor’s lounge."
0,"Carved marble inlaid with rare metals fashioned images of lords and lands, mountains and forests."
0,Thick columns rose along the walls merging into intricate carvings of spiraling biological geometry across the high ceiling.
0,How many lifetimes had been spent in the creation of a single room?
0,"Without a doubt, no room in all the world could compare, and yet Jethro had not claimed it for himself."
0,Why would he allow another to stay in such grandeur that should have been his right as spoils of war?
0,Did Jethro not care for wealth and luxury?
0,What other purpose would he have to conquer the Amelian Empire if not for the wealth it possessed that the Kingdom of Tolmyur lacked?
0,"The pale-faced human named Austin sat at the center of the lounge on a masterfully embroidered, padded sofa with a woman embracing him on each side."
0,"Before she approached, she caught a whiff of deshalu, a horrid and addicting herb that had lost her the first maid of her memory."
0,"Or perhaps, she was given a maid the palace knew was an addict because she was not the true princess but some double instead."
0,"The thought soured Eydis’s mood, but she kept a calm expression as she approached."
0,"Sure enough, his eyes are dilated, Eydis thought to herself."
0,"At least the herb was not debilitating, so hopefully the man retained his reason."
0,"Austin was tall for a human, close to Eydis in height."
0,"He had short, dark brown hair, brown eyes, and a short, unkempt beard."
0,"Had he not been so pale, Eydis would have expected him to be Tolmyurin."
0,He wore clothing of tight fit and high quality: pants of thick blue fabric and a long-sleeved shirt decorated with black and red vertical stripes with small black buttons running down the red placket.
0,"Eydis had never seen their like before, and she could not imagine such clothing originating from Amel and especially not from Tolmyur."
0,He must have come from the other world as Jethro claimed.
0,"Both women embracing him wore nothing more than a thin, transparent blue shawl about their shoulders."
0,"No fire burned in the fireplace, so Eydis wondered if they clung to the man to ward off the chill in the room rather than out of obligation."
0,"Winter was only half spent, so Eydis certainly found the lack of fire odd."
0,Perhaps this man preferred the warmth of women over the heat of a flame.
0,She found the thought unsettling that he might have given them no other choice but to hold him or remain cold in their underdress.
0,"The woman on his left had short, thick brown hair that stuck out in all directions and long, drooping, pointed ears with a line of fine brown hair along the top edge."
0,Her nose and cheekbones were highly freckled as were her shoulders and upper arms.
0,"Her chest was more endowed than other races of elfkind, and her thick, medium length tail had a small tuft of brown hair at the tip."
0,"The troll, or Mountain Elf, looked at Eydis with surprise and then shame in her deep-orange eyes."
0,"On Austin’s right sat a spriggan, a Forest Elf."
0,Her smaller stature was common among women of her race.
0,She had fair skin and faded brown hair.
0,"Her ears were far shorter than other elfkind, similar to humans but narrowing upwards to a sharp point."
0,What set Forest Elves apart most from other elfkind were their horns and legs.
0,Two thin horns like single-point antlers grew from the corners of her forehead.
0,"Their digitigrade legs had a more pronounced tarsal joint, looking far more bestial in nature."
0,"Her slender body was completely hairless and sported one of the longest tails of the elfkind, meant for keeping balance in trees and while sprinting over uneven forest terrain."
0,The Forest Elf clung to the human with distressed white knuckles as he played with and wrapped her long and elegant tail around in his hand.
0,Eydis’s stomach knotted in disgust.
0,Austin stopped toying with the woman’s tail when Eydis stood before him.
0,His eyes gradually widened the longer he stared at Eydis until he pushed the two women aside and stood for a better look.
0,The Mountain Elf scowled at Austin from behind while coddling the panting Forest Elf.
0,He spoke a few words in that unknown language Eydis assumed was English.
0,She felt him touch her hair from behind and turned to swat his hand away.
0,"When he was about to touch her again, Eydis grabbed him by the placket of his shirt, lifted him with ease, and threw him into the ground in front of the sofa."
0,The Mountain Elf watched the treatment smiling through a sneer.
0,Eydis swiped her hand at the chair to his left.
0,The intricate carving and exquisite embroidery blew apart in a diagonal line.
0,The chair buckled inward and collapsed to the floor.
0,"Eydis’s barrier was not sharp enough to cut completely through objects yet, more bludgeon them, but the man gasping for breath on the floor understood her message."
0,“I am not another plaything given you by Jethro.
0,You are to teach me English.”
0,Austin gleaned one word in his confusion.
0,“English?”
0,"His actions struck Eydis as odd, and she doubted it was because it was from the effects of the deshalu grass."
0,He was surprised and elated when he saw her.
0,He was confused when he heard her mention English.
0,"As she was now, Eydis could not communicate with him."
0,"She had no means to question him about the sprouting epiphany that struggled to break the surface in the back of her mind, so she grabbed the man by his shirt and drug him across the lounge into the study, setting him by the desk."
0,"“English,” she ordered again, sitting down in the padded leather chair behind the desk."
0,The man quickly complied.
1,"The English language was peculiar but not altogether difficult to learn, and despite Austin’s loathsome personality, he was quite the competent instructor."
0,"If only he kept his distance instead of purposefully leaning close into Eydis when inspecting her writing drills, pronouncing each symbol directly into her ear."
0,"Eydis pushed him away for the third time, now with enough force to knock him prone."
0,"About the time Eydis began feeling hungry, the guards called from the door in their deep, reverberating voices."
0,Austin’s demeanor immediately perked up.
0,A Forrest Elf girl appeared in the entryway to the study.
0,She was younger than Austin’s Forest Elf slave; an adolescent with stretched and irritated skin encasing her horns.
0,"The skin was not yet peeling, suggesting she was about two and a half years old."
0,Full adults nearing three years of age had no skin on their horns.
0,Her hair was more wheat-colored and shimmered with mesmerizing flecks of silver.
0,She carried a carafe and platter piled with food on a silver tray and set it where Austin patted the desk.
0,"Eydis was grateful for the perfect timing of the meal and was about to thank the silent server girl, but Justin called for her first before the girl could walk away."
0,“Rynn.” He patted on his lap.
0,Rynn turned back towards him and sat on his lap.
0,Eydis watched in disgust as she broke apart the bread and meat and fed Austin.
0,"All the while he fondled the girl, but her eyes remained dead of emotion."
0,"When Austin reached under her skirt for her tail, Eydis lost her appetite."
0,She pulled the girl off Austin and handed her the tray.
0,"“I think he has had enough if he would rather play,” she said, irritated."
0,"She leaned down and whispered into Rynn’s ear, “Share the rest with his slaves,” before patting her back to send her out of the study."
0,Eydis turned to Austin and saw irritation staring back at her.
0,She grabbed the stack of parchment and slammed it on the table where the platter once sat.
0,"“English,” she demanded."
1,"The next day, Austin kept his High Elf slave with him in the study throughout the lesson."
0,"Unlike the first day, Austin found little interest in Eydis and instead kept his submissive slave close, casting glances at Eydis as if saying, “This is how you should act in front of me.” At least Eydis was rid of his unwanted advances, but the scene before her was no less distracting."
0,"As the lesson continued, Austin grew less interested in instruction and more interested in his slave until he led the High Elf out of the study."
0,"“Symra,” he called as he pulled the Elf out of sight down the long, suspended corridor to the bed chamber."
0,Eydis gripped the edge of the desk in frustration.
0,The force of her grip split the polished wood and shattered it into splinters in her hand.
0,Jethro ordered her to learn English from this man.
0,He must have known Austin would react adversely to her recalcitrance and refuse to instruct her.
0,Eydis could not bear the thought of submitting to this human filth to fulfill her agreement with Jethro.
0,"In Austin’s place, the Mountain Elf entered the study."
0,She stood beside Eydis and bowed low.
0,“I apologize for my master.
0,"When the commanders come for lessons, he is far more amenable.”"
0,"“No matter,” Eydis spat."
0,“I am not here to control him.
0,I only need to learn.
0,Can you teach me?”
0,"“Yes.” Symra picked up quickly from where Austin left off, and due to her ability to speak both English and Elven, Eydis felt Symra’s instruction was far more effective."
0,A thought crossed Eydis’s mind that Austin knew Symra would be better suited to instruct her initially but chose instead to teach her hoping to molest her like one of his slaves.
0,"Now that he realized Eydis would not submit, he left the work to Symra."
0,A call from the doors announced Rynn’s arrival.
0,"Like the previous day, she carried Austin’s meal."
0,"He ate an absurd amount, two times during Eydis’s lesson the previous day."
0,"If he ate so regularly, he would have four to six meals a day."
0,This kept the servant girl busy running back and forth between preparing food in the kitchen on the bottom floor of the palace and carrying it to the emperor’s chambers on the fourth floor.
0,Eydis called to Rynn as she was about to turn down the corridor to the bed chamber.
0,“He will not be wanting his meal right now.” 
0,Rynn only glanced back at Eydis with weary eyes and continued into the corridor.
0,"Eydis stood to retrieve her out of fear for the girl, but Symra gripped Eydis’s wrist."
0,"“This is not her first time witnessing such acts of cruelty,” Symra spoke with ire."
0,"“It is better for her to appease Austin and stay in his service where Dyas, Wian, and I can watch over her than for her to be unprotected elsewhere.”"
0,"“You surely cannot mean that,” Eydis said, but she sensed that Symra believed it, as the words rang with truth."
0,“I am the one who brought her to Austin’s attention.
0,She is safer here.
0,The alternative is far worse.”
1,"Eydis kept a closer eye on Rynn over the following days, arriving earlier in the morning, staying longer for lessons, and then leaving later in the evening."
0,"Austin grew irritated that Eydis spent so much time in his chambers, especially because she forcefully intervened whenever his actions grew too intimate with anyone."
0,"As expected, Symra continued teaching every lesson until Eydis caught up to her ability in English, far faster than both Symra and Austin anticipated."
0,"Much to both Eydis and Austin’s displeasure, he had to continue the lessons from then on, but Eydis set strict rules."
0,"“You will not touch Symra, Dyas, or Wian."
0,You will not touch Rynn.
0,You eat.
0,You sleep.
0,You teach.
0,Nothing else!”
0,Eydis would keep him so occupied teaching her English that he would not have the time to satisfy his lust.
0,She even sacrificed the time she needed to practice the spatial magic Jethro taught her.
0,"Austin wanted to control her, but she would not be controlled."
0,He grew more tired and more irritated as the lessons continued.
0,"The more troubled Eydis saw Austin, the happier she became."
0,"She realized that just as she had been ordered by Jethro to learn English, Austin had been ordered to teach it."
0,She held that order against Austin like a knife to his throat.
0,"She was confident in her ability to win this power struggle, at least until Austin found the one weakness Eydis had no control over."
1,"On the morning of the seventh day after Austin was forced to personally instruct Eydis in English, Eydis arrived to find Symra and Dyas huddled almost out of sight near the lit fireplace on the far side of the lounge."
0,"Austin and his third slave, Wian the Forest Elf, were nowhere to be seen."
0,"Eydis thought to call out to Austin to begin the lesson, but Symra waved Eydis over."
0,"Eydis thought they knelt near the fire for warmth, but she had been horribly mistaken."
0,"Symra held Rynn in her lap while Dyas ran her hands over the girl to heal the numerous bruises on Rynn’s face, breasts, and stomach."
0,"The dried blood on Rynn’s chin showed that either her lip had split and was mended by Dyas, or the abuse was severe enough that she spat up blood."
0,Eydis reached down in horror.
0,Her fingers clasped a small garment discarded on the floor beside them.
0,"It was a bloodstained blue shawl, the same that Austin’s slaves wore."
0,"“When did this happen,” Eydis asked, gripping the loathsome fabric close to her chest."
0,“She was no more than a servant girl yesterday.”
0,"“Austin made the request to Jethro after you left,” Symra spoke softly with a growl deep in her throat."
0,“I did not realize.
0,We were asleep when Rynn arrived.
0,She never cried out.
0,I woke to the beating and stopped Austin before worse could happen.”
0,"“Where is he,” Eydis demanded, her eyes blazing red."
0,"“Wian is keeping him occupied so we can treat Rynn,” Dyas answered."
0,“I thought things would be better for her here…”
0,"Eydis wanted to scream, to berate Symra for promising that Rynn would be safe so long as she and Dyas could watch over her, but she also felt she was not blameless in this."
0,"In her attempt to keep Austin too occupied to spend time with his slaves, she had instead made him more violent towards the weakest of those within his grasp."
0,"The more Eydis asserted her control, the more his slaves, the more this innocent Forest Elf girl, would suffer."
0,She realized her folly.
0,Control over Austin was not important.
0,She could tolerate him.
0,He could do nothing more than annoy her or inconvenience her.
0,"This young girl on the other hand was completely at the mercy of Austin’s whims, his violence and abuse."
0,"With one word, he could have her killed or even kill her himself without any repercussions."
0,"Neither Symra, Dyas, nor Wian could act against him."
0,"Eydis was not the true princess of the Amelian Empire, but that did not make Rynn or Wian or Symra or anyone else under Tolmyur’s oppression any less her people."
0,She could not save everyone.
0,She could not defeat the whole of Tolmyur’s armies.
0,"However, there was something she could do within her power."
0,"If nothing else, she was the only one here who could save Rynn."
0,"“Where is he,” Eydis demanded again."
0,"She stood to head for the most likely location, the bed chamber down the long corridor connected to the lounge, but a hand clasped her ankle."
0,Rynn looked up at Eydis with swollen eyes that could open no more than a slit.
0,“Please… no… I’m fine… I’m fine… I have to… I have to…”
0,Eydis’s heart collapsed in her chest hearing Rynn’s plea not to be saved.
0,"Her fingers grew rigid like talons ready to claw Austin apart if she could find him, but Symra also clasped Eydis’s hand."
0,“Confronting Austin will not help.”
0,Eydis understood.
0,She needed to confront the source.
0,“I will speak with Jethro.”
0,"She tried to teleport directly to the grand council chamber, but a teleportation barrier blocked her entry."
1,She dashed out of the emperor’s chambers and down the many stairways to the large doors of the council chamber.
0,A dwarf guard blocked her path.
0,“Jethro is in an important meeting.
0,He cannot be bothered.”
0,The dwarf grabbed Eydis’s arm to turn her away.
0,Eydis hooked her fingers under the dwarf’s breastplate and tossed him across the hall.
0,The man landed twenty yards away with a metallic thud.
0,Two human guards drew their swords.
0,Eydis released an offensive barrier with a wave of her hand.
0,"Both swords split in half, and the sharp barrier cut deep through the soldiers’ armor."
0,Blood spilled onto the white marble floors.
0,A backhand that dented each of their helmets knocked the soldiers unconscious to the floor.
0,The final human soldier about drew his sword but thought better of further antagonizing a Lurr and stepped out of Eydis’s way.
1,Eydis pushed open the doors after he announced her arrival.
0,Jethro sat cross-legged on the throne conversing with a group of armed humans.
0,Four fairy corpses sprawled before him in pools of blood.
0,A fifth fairy shouted praise to Eydis seeing the bloodied guards behind her but was immediately ran through by a sword and tossed next to the other bodies.
0,“To what do I owe the honor of your uninvited visit?” Jethro asked.
0,Eydis approached the throne with her eyes blazing red.
0,"The men in front of Jethro aimed their blades against her, but Jethro ordered them still and simply extended the palm of his hand."
0,“I do not think you want a repeat.
0,Are you so willing to throw away our agreement and die meaninglessly?”
0,Jethro’s simple warning stopped her advance.
0,She knew she could not defeat him.
0,"That was not her intent in coming, but her seething anger kept her body rigid."
0,"Eydis tried to voice her feelings through her quivering anger, but her mouth only uttered a few simple words."
0,“Why a child?”
0,Jethro’s expression grew oblivious.
0,"Eydis did not doubt he could have made the connection after Austin’s request last night, but in case his reaction was not an act, she elaborated."
0,"“Austin, that man you brought from the other world, why did you agree to give him a child slave?”"
0,Jethro’s sent his men out of the council chamber with the bodies.
0,“I am not sure what you are so angry about.
0,I thought she was an adult according to your elfkind.
0,Something about independence defining maturity?”
0,“Could you not see that she is still too young?
0,Would you give a human child of like age to be a slave to some man who would not hesitate to…!”
0,Jethro held out his hand to silence Eydis.
0,He relaxed his posture into a slouch and grew a faint smile.
0,"All regal demeaner vanished, same as every time he would speak with her after she agreed to help him."
0,“I will admit that it does please me to learn there are some people in this world who do question such appalling behavior.
0,"Such things are far too common in this horrid, primitive world."
0,"For your concern, you have my thanks.”"
0,"“If… if you also see it as wrong, then why do you allow it?"
0,Can you not set her free?” Eydis could not comprehend Jethro’s response.
0,"From what he said, he also felt Rynn was too young to be a sex slave."
0,"Jethro’s words instilled a feeling of unease in Eydis, and when she thought more on what he said, the unease became horror."
0,"In all her interactions with Symra, Dyas, and Wian, never once did any of them question their roles as Austin’s slaves."
0,"No matter how much they detested it, they accepted it."
0,“Why?
0,"Because she chose this herself,” Jethro replied with mild disgust."
0,Truth.
0,Eydis could not believe what she sensed in Jethro’s reply.
0,What?
0,She chose…?
0,Why?
0,"Eydis mouthed the words, but her voice could not speak them."
0,“I hope you are not under the assumption that I simply gave the girl to Austin at his request.
0,I sent him away and called for her to meet with me first.
0,"I told her of Austin’s request and warned her about exactly what it would mean to be a slave to such a man, that she would not just remain his personal chef."
0,She would lose all the protection inherent in working under me.
0,"From her reaction, the girl most likely understood without me needing to explain it."
0,I gave her full liberty to refuse.
0,"In the end, she agreed to the role despite my warnings."
0,“I want you to know I have no interest in such things.
0,"To be honest, I find the practice barbaric, but that means little."
0,"While my commanders follow my every instruction with exactness, the common soldier, even those here in the palace, is less… disciplined."
0,"In all my authority, even I am limited in what I can enforce when my men are not under constant watch."
0,You would not believe what they do to each other…” Jethro sighed.
0,"“A soldier’s right to spoils of war,” Jethro whispered to himself after a moment of pause, every bit of him honest in his disgust."
0,"He looked back at Eydis, knowing her keen Lurr ears had heard him."
0,"“You see, all the slaves you have seen thus far, including the one I gave you, worked in the palace and collectively gave themselves to the soldiers in exchange for their mercy in order to protect their friends, families, and the like from similar or worse fates."
0,"Before I gave the first three to Austin, they were already in the hands of my men by their own will."
0,"That girl understood that should she refuse, someone else would be given to Austin instead.”"
0,“Then it was no choice at all!” Eydis gritted her teeth.
0,"Everything Jethro said may have been true, but that did not make it right."
0,"She now understood Symra’s warning, why being a server girl for Austin was better than the alternative."
0,Her chest constricted at the realization that Rynn may have already fallen prey to the soldiers before entering Austin’s service as a chef under Jethro’s protection.
0,She now understood the events that transpired last night.
0,"Rynn accepted and justified the necessity of her self-sacrifice, but when faced with her trauma once more, she grew fearful and resisted."
0,"She was already Austin’s slave by then, and Austin expected perfect obedience from his slaves."
0,Symra intervened while he was beating Rynn into submission.
0,"Or it could very well be possible that Rynn did not resist, and Austin beat her nonetheless, the wretched human that he was."
0,"But, no matter what Jethro professed, one of his authority should have been able to deny Austin’s request."
0,"Even now, he should be able to correct it."
0,Eydis calmed herself and pleaded to Jethro.
0,"“You are the ruler of Amel, the commander of all Tolmyur’s forces."
0,Releasing Rynn should not cause issue.
0,"If my cooperation in finding the princess has earned me anything more, please give Rynn to me."
0,You should at least be able to do that much.”
0,Jethro gazed with weary eyes at Eydis’s suppliance and shook his head.
0,"“That, I also cannot do."
0,"When she was among the kitchen staff, I was her owner as conqueror of Amel."
0,"I have an agreement with Austin to reward him for his services, and for instructing you he personally requested the girl as his reward."
0,"As I mentioned, she agreed and is now the private property of Austin, not me."
0,"I detest going back on my promises, so I will not take her back.” "
0,A dimpled grin grew on Jethro’s face.
0,“It is his choice whether or not to free her or gift her to another.
0,This discussion is between you and him.”
0,That was permission to act against Austin.
0,Eydis was sure of it.
0,"If Rynn could be hers, no one would be allowed to touch her."
0,"She ran out of the council chamber, barely catching Jethro’s parting order."
0,“Remember not to kill him!”
1,"Once outside the teleportation barrier, she teleported directly to Austin’s lounge."
0,Symra and Dyas remained by the fireplace with Rynn.
0,"Austin was still missing, and if Wian was keeping him company, he had to be in the bedchamber."
0,"Eydis ran down the long, suspended corridor and found Austin with Wian atop his bed."
0,Eydis dove onto the bed and threw Austin off.
0,He flew into the wall and fell to the floor with a pathetic cry.
0,"“Leave us,” Eydis ordered Wian."
0,"Instead of gratitude for Eydis’s intervention, Wian grew terrified of Eydis’s glowing red eyes and sprinted from the room."
0,“You!
0,You are not her!” Austin yelled at Eydis from across the room.
0,He struggled to stand using the wall as support.
0,His eyes were heavily dilated.
0,The wretched addict.
0,“You are not Eydis!
0,You are nothing like her!”
0,"Eydis jumped off the bed, grabbed Austin by the neck with both hands, and pinned him against the wall."
0,"He grabbed her arms, trying futilely to peel her off."
0,Her grip tightened until saliva drained from his mouth.
0,She wanted to squeeze.
0,"She wanted so desperately to feel flesh tear and his neck pop in her hands, but she stopped."
0,"Jethro ordered her not to kill him, and while she desperately wished she could, she had even more reason to stay her hand for now."
0,That lingering epiphany from the day she met Austin found clarity.
0,Eydis spoke in a subdued voice.
0,“You know the other Eydis.
0,You met her in your world.
0,"I was going to kill you here, now."
0,You have luck.
0,Now I cannot.
0,Jethro wants to find the other Eydis.
0,He wants to kill her.
0,You teach English to help Jethro kill Eydis.”
0,Austin’s eyes grew wide.
0,“Gi… goulgng… gurt…”
0,"Any attempt to speak came out as broken gargles, so Eydis eased her grip."
0,“I wouldn’t hurt her!
0,Gah… I don’t want to kill her!”
0,Austin saw the princess with the same lustful eyes as he saw Symra and the others.
0,"Eydis released her grip, dropping Austin to his knees gasping for breath."
0,“The other me is my… sister.
0,You want to help her?
0,"If you help me find her, stop Jethro from killing her, I will not kill you.”"
0,"“But if Jethro finds out, he will kill me!” "
0,"“If you say no, I kill you now.” This was no lie."
0,"If Austin declined, Eydis was ready to crush his head into the wall with her heel like a vulgar pest."
0,"If he was unwilling to help, his knowledge of the princess was far too dangerous to keep him in association with Jethro."
0,She could find an excuse to appease Jethro afterwards.
0,“I traded my freedom for women and luxury.
0,He will not let me.
0,He only lets me leave the room for official work.”
0,"“Work like making Rynn one of your slaves,” Eydis howled, making Austin shrink further."
0,She quieted her voice once more.
0,“Jethro needs me to find my sister.
0,I will say I need you.
0,He will listen.
0,We stop Jethro and help Eydis.
0,Say yes or die.”
0,"Austin hesitated, so Eydis punched the wall beside his head."
0,"The stone fractured, sending shrapnel into the side of his face."
0,Small cuts dripped blood from his ear and cheek.
0,“Yes!
0,Yes!
0,I’ll help!”
0,A grin spread on Eydis’s face.
0,His terror pleased her.
0,Only one more matter needed to be addressed.
0,“Thank me for not killing you.”
0,“Thank you!
0,Thank you thank you thank you--”
0,Eydis crouched down and grabbed his mouth.
0,“Not words.
0,You give me Rynn.”
0,Their noses nearly touched.
0,A menacing grin that threatened to devour Austin grew on Eydis’s face.
0,Eydis pulled his face near to look into her glowing red eyes.
0,Her eyes radiated such a deep crimson that they almost exuded visible heat.
0,Tears budded in Austin’s eyes and he nodded to the best of his ability while she held his face.
0,"Eydis slapped the side of Austin’s head, knocking him unconscious."
0,"Hopefully that would give Symra, Dyas, and Wian a break."
0,She could forego lessons for the day or possibly read one of the many books brought from the other world.
0,She found them immensely fascinating.
1,"Eydis tore down one of the long, gilded curtains from the bedchamber windows and returned to the fireplace of the lounge."
0,Wian knelt with the others next to Rynn.
0,Dyas no longer healed Rynn so perhaps she finished.
0,The swelling of Rynn’s face was noticeably less.
0,Rynn saw Eydis approach and opened her eyes a little wider than before.
0,"“Is he,” Symra began, likely having heard some yelling on the other side of the long corridor."
0,“He is alive.
0,"Jethro would be furious if I killed his English instructor, and I need to continue learning the language.”"
0,"Symra looked disappointed, but she must have realized that with Austin gone, they would all be back in the hands of the soldiers."
0,Or perhaps her disappointment came from knowing the reason Eydis needed to learn English: to pursue the true princess.
0,"“I expect he will treat you a little better now that he fears me,” Eydis added, unable to fully address Symra’s unspoken concerns."
0,She knelt next to Rynn and lifted the frail girl.
0,She pressed their foreheads together.
0,“I am taking you from this place.”
0,Rynn showed emotion for the first time.
0,Tears fell silently from the corners of her eyes.
1,Eydis wrapped Rynn in the regal fabric and carried her down to her room on the third floor of the palace.
0,"Jethro justified his actions by stating this was Rynn’s choice, but Eydis could not see Rynn as anything but a helpless child forced into slavery by Tolmyur."
0,"This further fueled her anger against Jethro, Austin, and all the depraved humans who relished subjecting one so young to such suffering."
0,She tended to Rynn the entire day with the help of her own slave.
0,"Dyas was not a well-practiced life mage, leaving most of Rynn’s worst injuries unfinished, so Eydis’s slave continued the treatment."
0,"Now understanding the truth of the slaves she saw in the palace and the one given her by Jethro, Eydis apologized profusely for her ignorance and exploitation of the woman’s situation."
0,"As much as Eydis tried to separate herself from the Amelian Empire now that she knew what she was, she couldn’t."
0,These were still her people.
0,"Whether Eydis was the true princess or a Lurr, Rynn was someone she should have protected."
0,"Rynn’s mental and emotional scars may never heal like her physical injuries, but she survived."
0,"Eydis could not right all the wrongs of the Tolmyur Kingdom, and she doubted that she could free Rynn without her falling back into Tolmyur’s grasp, but perhaps she could keep her close and personally protect her from all the evils of the world."
0,Eydis wrapped Rynn in a warm blanket and held her tight through the night to comfort the girl that cried silently in her sleep.
0,"Chapter 15
“Revival of the Old Ways”
Eydis"
1,"Eydis knelt on the floor mat with her weight resting on her ankles, her legs close together, and her hands clasped in her lap."
0,She was told this kneeling posture was called seiza in this world and had originated in a land far to the east.
0,"When Eydis looked up the word on her smartphone, she noticed there were similarities, but the purposes were different."
0,"In the land of its origin on Earth, the posture was used for respect or reverence."
0,"In Eydis’s training on Whinhlem, it was used to make recognition of the flow of ven through the body easier by eliminating the physical sensations of the body, namely the legs where veins were large."
0,"The confusion of its origin led Eydis’s students to believe she learned her martial skills in the eastern countries, and many of them had come to the conclusion that Eydis was what they called a spiritualist."
0,"This led Eydis to believe that there may have been those in the past who knew about magic, which made sense considering Earth had multiple words for ven, such as mana, but now the true practice of the art was lost, only replaced by empty motions."
0,The thrice weekly self-defense class changed in structure under Eydis’s supervision.
0,"A month after Eydis began teaching, the hour-long course that held a ten-minute warmup and stretch period and ended with another ten-minute cooldown and relaxation period changed to a two hour session with fifteen minutes of meditation before the initial warmup and final cooldown."
0,"With an increase in length, a properly skilled instructor, and a curriculum created by the professor in charge with Eydis’s input, once the new year began, those who attained a two-thirds attendance in the course over a two-month period could receive one of what was called a Physical Education and Conditioning credit."
0,Eydis was informed that a certain number was required of the students by the university.
0,"With university credit available for the course, the number of students attending quadrupled when courses renewed in January."
0,"“Sammy, do not move."
0,The discomfort is part of the meditation.” Eydis stared sternly at her friend who shifted her legs to relieve the numbing tension.
0,"“This is harder for some of us, you know,” Sammy whined."
0,“All the more reason to grow accustomed to it.
0,"Eventually the pain will lessen, and you may begin to feel a flowing sensation different from the numbness you felt before."
0,"It is very subtle, but that is what I want you to focus on.”"
0,"After another five minutes passed, Eydis stood and gave the position in front of the students back to the professor who in turn told everyone to lay back and relax."
0,A unanimous sigh of relief filled the room as the students rolled off their numb legs to their backs.
0,"Screams and laughs erupted as friends slapped their neighbor’s legs, causing an assault of needle-like sensations."
1,Eydis walked to the back corner of the room to where Justin knelt in the same meditating posture beside one of the rolled-up mats.
0,The only difference was that he had remained in that position from the start of the class under Eydis’s orders as he had every time he brought Eydis to the class over the past month.
0,"He only left the position when the class, namely Eydis, needed him to act as an assailant for demonstrations, which he did begrudgingly."
0,“What are you feeling?” Eydis sat down beside him and leaned against the wall with her arms resting atop her knees.
0,"“Not my legs, that’s for sure."
0,I don’t think I could stand even if I wanted to.”
0,"Eydis flicked Justin’s foot, causing him to wince."
0,"“You felt the direction the sensation flowed up your leg, yes?” Justin nodded, so Eydis flicked his foot again."
0,"“Now instead of that sensation, did you feel any other sensation flowing in a different direction?”"
0,Justin shook his head.
0,Eydis sighed.
0,"“With so much ven, you should be able to feel something, even if you cannot use it.”"
0,"For Justin to recognize the toxic ven his body produced, he needed to first be able to feel the healthy ven in his body."
0,He would then be able to distinguish between the two.
0,"After a month, he made no progress even though Eydis was using the same methods Evhial had used on her as a child to help her first recognize her own ven."
0,"He was human, so she expected him to take longer, but he should have at least felt something by now."
0,This was troubling.
0,"If Evhial’s methods did not work, there was little she could do for him."
0,"She made a promise to help him purge his body of the toxic ven to repay him for everything he was doing for her, and hopefully solidify her place in his home as Sammy suggested, but she was struggling to fulfill her promise, making her feel that her dream of starting a new life here was still far away."
0,"Hiding her depression behind a confident smile that told Justin he could succeed, Eydis dug into the bag beside her and pulled out a novel, one of Sean’s."
0,"Having become fluent in English after only two and a half months of conversation and studying grammar books and dictionaries, she decided that reading novels was the next best step of deepening her understanding of the language."
0,"Justin expressed interest in learning Eydis’s native tongue, but aside from explaining simple phrases and the most basic of grammar, she told him that his own studies at the university should take priority and that he was already spending much of his free time learning to recognize and control the ven inside him."
0,"“If you want to learn something, pick one thing and master it, then move to the next."
0,"Elven is not important, and your ven is."
0,Focus on that first.”
0,"Eydis would repeat this each time Justin asked, but a worry in the back of her mind told her that Justin might not be able to feel his ven no matter how much he practiced."
0,"She had to wonder if there was some correlation between his toxic ven and his inability to feel healthy ven, but she had no one in this world to ask and no way to test her hypothesis."
0,"She would have to find many people with the same condition as Justin and teach them all how to recognize and control their ven, and that was impossible in her current situation."
1,"After an announcement from the professor, the relaxation period ended, and the students prepped to go home."
0,"Sammy bounced over to Eydis and Justin, grabbed a water bottle from Eydis’s bag, and drank half of it in one long swig."
0,“Any progress for our hopeless man?” she asked.
0,"“None yet,” Eydis replied."
0,"“And you can stop now,” she told Justin."
0,Justin shifted off his legs and had to use his hands to move them out in front of him to let the circulation return.
0,"After a few seconds, Sammy grabbed Justin’s calf, causing him to reel back and tense up."
0,“Could you not!”
0,Sammy laughed.
0,He tried to grab her but could do no more than lean forward.
0,Sammy jumped out of his reach and kept laughing.
0,“Excuse me.
0,Eydis?”
0,"Sammy’s red-headed friend, Chloe, appeared behind Sammy."
0,She was half a foot taller than Sammy with a smooth and clean complexion on her round face.
0,"She wore tight black exercise shorts and a white t-shirt that was soaked and slightly transparent from sweat, showing the black sports bra that was needed to support her well-endowed chest."
0,"When Eydis first met Chloe, the girl was overweight, but over the course of the past month, she had done well losing a little."
0,"Eydis still felt that Chloe should lose more, but having seen many women of this world, Chloe could be considered on the healthy side compared to others."
0,"Eydis found that most people of this world would be considered unhealthy in the Amelian Empire, so she understood her views on what was healthy might be different."
0,One of Eydis’s students even expressed concern that Eydis was too skinny.
0,"“Um, you said something about being able to feel something different when doing seiza."
0,"I don’t know if it’s what you meant, but I think I felt something.”"
0,Eydis closed her book and placed it back in the bag.
0,“Can you still feel it?”
0,Chloe shook her head.
0,Eydis stood and placed her hands just below Chloe’s ears.
0,“Excuse me.” She then placed her forehead against Chloe’s.
0,Chloe blushed in surprise.
0,Eydis separated and sat back down.
0,"“Next class when we meditate, I want you to focus on that feeling and do not lose it."
0,"After the closing meditation, see if you can continue that feeling through the rest period."
0,"If you can, talk to me afterwards."
0,Can you do this?”
0,Chloe nodded shyly and then excused herself.
0,Sammy pressured Eydis for an explanation.
0,“Ven was in motion inside her body.
0,"She might have natural ability,” Eydis clarified."
0,"“Chloe can use magic?” Sammy whispered, bouncing in excitement."
0,“I cannot be certain yet.
0,Everyone has ven.
0,Having ven does not mean you can use magic.” Eydis looked beside her at Justin who could only grimace in reply.
0,"“Her capacity is small and what I would expect from humans, but her ven is extraordinarily active, unlike you and Justin."
0,We will have to wait and see.”
1,"The next self-defense class, Eydis performed her job as required but paid special attention to Chloe."
0,"Once the rest period ended, Chloe approached Eydis."
0,"“I had it, but I couldn’t hold on that long.”"
0,Eydis sent Chloe away with the assurance that it was possible.
1,"On the final class of the week, Chloe did not approach Eydis at the end of the rest period."
0,“Chloe?
0,Are you okay?”
0,“What’s wrong?” 
0,“Are you hurt?” 
0,A small group stood around Chloe who refused to move from her position on her back.
0,One of the students approached Eydis.
0,“Chloe wants you.”
0,Eydis set down her book and walked over with Justin struggling to follow on his lifeless legs.
0,"“I have it,” Chloe said when Eydis approached."
0,“I don’t want to lose it.”
0,Eydis crouched down and grabbed Chloe by the hand.
0,“Keep focused.” She pulled Chloe to her feet.
0,“Can you still feel it?”
0,“Yes!” 
0,“Mimic my motions.” 
0,Eydis traced a line with her right hand from her heart to her abdomen and back up the other side.
0,She then took a step back with her right foot and extended her left arm forward.
0,She continued the trace across her chest and down her left arm until the fingers on her right hand ended at her left wrist.
0,Eydis and Chloe repeated this motion four more times with variations in the lines traced by their fingers as if connecting key points in the body and directing them to their left hand.
0,“Where is the feeling now?” Eydis asked.
0,Chloe looked at her left arm.
0,“In my hand.”
0,“Now repeat it the other direction.” 
0,Eydis and Chloe mirrored the movements with their left hand.
0,“It’s in my right hand!”
0,"“Is this some sort of calisthenics,” one of the observing girls asked."
0,"“I am unfamiliar with the word, so I cannot say."
0,"Chloe, extend your right hand, palm down.”"
0,"Chloe obeyed, and Eydis placed her hand underneath."
0,"She retracted it and then asked each of the seven observers who remained to place their hand underneath as she did, asking if they felt anything."
0,Each woman said they felt nothing until the last screamed out in surprise.
0,“It’s hot!”
0,“Hot?” Eydis pulled Justin inside the group and had him place his hand under.
0,“Feel anything?”
0,"“Nothing,” Justin replied."
0,“What is this?” Chloe stood frozen in the position Eydis made her hold.
0,“You can relax now.
0,Our bodies have energy in them.
0,I am just showing you how to recognize it.”
0,"“Like the Chinese chi,” one student piped in."
0,Was chi yet another word for ven?
0,"“They are probably one and the same,” Eydis replied."
0,"The first translation for ven Eydis learned from Justin, mana, came from the Pacific Islander traditions."
0,China was located across the Pacific.
0,Eydis wondered if the people of the far continent were more connected to magic than those on this side of the world.
0,"“For now, Chloe, practice meditation and those movements over the weekend and tell me how it goes on Monday.”"
0,“I’m going to try too!”
0,“Me too.”
0,“This is way too creepy.
0,Count me out.”
1,"While the students discussed with each other in varying levels of excitement, Eydis, Justin, and Sammy left the group and began walking to the bus stop."
0,“What was that about?” Sammy asked for further clarification once they were outside.
0,“Chloe is affiliated with the fire element.
0,"I tried to feel her ven, but I could not."
0,Thankfully there was one there who also has an affinity to fire.
0,She recognized Chloe’s ven.”
0,“So we can cross fire off the list of affinities Sammy and I have?” Justin asked.
0,Eydis nodded.
0,"“Wait, are you doing this to find out what elements we are affiliated with?” Sammy asked."
0,“That is part of it.
0,I do not plan on teaching any of them magic.
0,"This world does not have magic users, yes?”"
0,“We might have had some in the past.” 
0,"Sammy confirmed Eydis’s suspicions, and Justin followed up."
0,“A lot of cultures have miracle workers built into their legends.
0,Even in this country there was something called the Witch Hunts where anyone who was accused of being able to use magic was killed.
0,"Most of the western world has viewed magic as evil, and western influence is the strongest due to western countries conquering, colonizing, or indoctrinating most of the world.”"
0,"“And if those who could use magic were hunted, the art of magic would be hidden and lost over time.”"
0,Eydis understood how such a history could be the reason magic did not exist.
0,"If there was a cultural stigma associated with magic use, teaching it would only endanger others."
0,"“But things are probably different now,” Justin continued."
0,“I think only the most orthodox of people would still think of it as evil.
0,Most of our generation would probably openly accept it.
0,"There are many books, movies, and games that have magic in them."
0,"The concept is quite popular, even with adults."
0,But people’s feelings might be different when actually confronted with the real thing.”
0,Sammy folded her arms.
0,“It’s hard to ignore hundreds of years of social indoctrination.”
0,"“If I could learn to use magic, I wouldn’t care what others think.” "
0,“Same.” 
0,Eydis had already committed to teaching Sammy and Justin how to use magic if possible out of gratitude for their help and care.
0,"If they had no concerns about it, then she decided to continue."
0,The only remaining question was the feelings of the students in Eydis’s class.
0,They did not know anything.
0,One had already stated that what Eydis taught was creepy.
0,Her class needed a change.
1,"* * *
The next Monday, a large and loud crowd surrounded Chloe."
0,"She was thinner, having lost at least fifteen pounds."
0,"Such a fast weight loss would make one ill, but Chloe looked happy and healthy."
0,The only explanation Eydis could find was Chloe’s fire affinity.
0,Those with an affinity to fire have a high metabolism due to the cost of conversion from raw ven to fire ven.
0,Eydis did not have the time to confront Chloe before class because the prompt arrival of the professor broke up the excited babble.
0,She would have to wait until after.
0,"When Eydis came to the front to begin the first meditation, she did not ask anyone to kneel on their mats."
0,“I am making a slight change to my meditation.”
0,"Several whispers scattered across the room, most of them from the students who stayed behind after last Friday’s class."
0,"“Where I come from, the body is believed to have a special energy inside of it."
0,"Some have called it chi, as in the Chinese chi."
0,"Where I come from, it is called ven.” "
0,"When Eydis brought up her idea to reveal the purpose of the meditation to the class, both Justin and Sammy advised against using the word mana, as it was almost directly associated with the use of magic in modern pop culture, religious and cultural history aside."
0,This led Eydis to use the universal term from Whinhlem.
0,“This energy is important for health and fitness.
0,The purpose of the meditation was for you to recognize it.
0,It was brought to my attention that such things may seem wrong depending on your upbringing.
0,"As such, I am no longer asking you to meditate in the same form I have instructed."
0,"If you have another form of meditation you would prefer, or if you would like to use the time as a rest period, you are free to do so."
0,I only ask that you do not be disruptive and show respect to those who would like to meditate.
0,The meditation time will now begin.”
0,"To Eydis’s surprise, the majority of the students continued to meditate in the same manner as they had previously."
0,"Only a few chose to meditate in another position, and the remaining laid down to use the time to rest."
1,"At the conclusion of the class, no one else came to talk to Eydis about any strange feelings they had while meditating."
0,"Most the students surrounded Chloe to ask about her drastic change, and all Chloe could reply was that it was due to Eydis’s meditation methods."
0,"Chloe remained in the room until all the other students left and then approached Eydis, Sammy, and Justin."
0,“I know there is something going on that you are keeping secret from everyone.” Chloe’s usual timidness was nowhere to be seen.
0,"I knew she would suspect something, Eydis thought while returning her book to her bag."
0,Chloe would not have had such a drastic change unless she spent a lot of time experimenting with her ven.
0,Eydis sighed lightly.
0,"Unsure what to say, she looked to Justin who had always been the one to decide what should and should not be told about her origins."
0,Justin looked up at the inquisitive girl from his seat against the wall.
0,“What makes you say that?”
0,Chloe pulled a half-empty water bottle out of her bag and stood it on her palm.
0,She closed her eyes and stood silent.
0,The plastic fogged up on the inside.
0,"When Chloe finished, she unscrewed the cap."
0,Steam wafted out.
0,She handed the bottle to Eydis.
0,It was hot.
0,Eydis’s suspicions were correct.
0,"In one weekend, Chloe had not only found out how to convert raw ven well enough for her to lose so much weight, but she was also able to turn that fire ven into thermal energy strong enough to heat a water bottle."
0,Eydis turned to Justin and Sammy for direction.
0,"She was not expecting anyone to be able to use magic, especially this fast."
0,"“When I have this feeling in my hands, I can also take things out of the oven without an oven mitt."
0,I can touch the red-hot coils on the stove.
0,I lit a match under my hand and the worst that happened was my hand getting dirty.
0,"What is going on,” Chloe asked Sammy."
0,"Sammy looked at Eydis, and Eydis again looked at Justin."
0,"Justin looked back at Eydis but only to ask a question, much to her relief."
0,“Do people normally progress this fast?”
0,That was not what Eydis wanted to hear.
0,"The question Justin asked involved information from her world, and she did not want to make any decisions on what should be shared with this one."
0,She still felt she knew too little about Earth to make any assumptions about what was safe.
0,Earth’s culling of magic was one such example.
0,She needed to be careful how she worded her answer.
0,"“For races with a natural affinity, yes."
0,I was able to as a child after only a few days.
0,"For… For you,” Eydis could not say humans without suggesting she was something different, “learning that fast is extremely rare.”"
0,“So you can do stuff like this too?
0,"What about you, Sammy?"
0,Justin?” Chloe’s eyes lit up.
0,"Eydis looked again to Justin, and he sighed."
0,"She knew he did not like being the one to make these decisions, and yet she kept forcing them upon him, inconveniencing him, which was counterproductive to her goal of securing her place in his home."
0,“Sammy and I can’t.
0,All I know is that I have more of that energy than Eydis does.
0,I just can’t do anything with it.”
0,“So Eydis can!
0,I want to see it!”
0,There was no calming Chloe’s excitement.
0,Eydis waited for Justin’s confirmation.
0,“Something small.”
0,"Eydis held her palm out in front of Chloe and channeled wind through, releasing it in small amounts."
0,Chloe’s long hair fluttered in the light breeze.
0,“It’s like having a fan on you at all times.
0,"This feels amazing after all that exercise,” Chloe said."
0,Sammy squeezed in and placed her face next to Chloe’s.
0,She closed her eyes and basked in the cool air.
0,"“Do you want to feel it too,” Eydis asked Justin."
0,"“I’m fine,” he replied."
0,Eydis stopped the flow much to the disappointment of Sammy and Chloe.
0,Justin continued his explanation.
0,"“Eydis doesn’t advertise that she can do this, and it’s very rare."
0,"We tend to keep it secret, so you should as well.”"
0,"“Yah, one of the girls in the dorm’s communal kitchen thought I had gone crazy when she caught me burning a match under my hand."
0,Is all I can do heat things or touch hot things without getting burned?”
0,Fire was the most dangerous of the natural elements.
0,"If abused, not only could the user become malnourished, but fire once released could become impossible to control."
0,"This was a real fear for Eydis because the ven in Chloe’s body was overactive, although that may have helped her use it as fast as she did."
0,The worst that could happen with wind was running out of breath and passing out.
0,Maybe cutting something by accident.
0,"With water, becoming dehydrated was a risk and could potentially be lethal if severe enough."
0,"Earth magic only caused physical exhaustion which, like wind, could lead to loss of consciousness."
0,"To prevent Chloe from harming herself or others, Eydis felt it was her responsibility to teach Chloe how to use her newfound magic."
0,"Thankfully, Evhial had taught Eydis the basics of each natural element even if Eydis could only use wind."
0,“An affinity to fire magic is dangerous if not controlled.
0,I can help you learn to use it safely.”
0,“So it is magic!” 
0,Eydis realized she let the word slip.
0,Sammy looked behind her to make sure that no one else heard Chloe’s exclamation.
0,The room was empty.
0,"Eydis looked down apologetically at Justin, but he looked back at her with an expression asking why she was apologizing."
0,Chloe had clearly made the connection and was only excited that Eydis confirmed it.
0,It was now Eydis’s responsibility to guide Chloe.
0,"“I cannot teach you here, but if you have time outside of the class when Justin is also free, we can meet.”"
0,Chloe looked back and forth between Justin and Eydis.
0,“Ah!”
0,Sammy quickly waved her hand.
0,"“No-no-no, it’s not what you’re thinking.”"
0,Chloe and Eydis planned to meet after each self-defense class in a smaller vacant room in the health and fitness building to continue teaching Chloe how to control her ven.
0,"By the end of the next week, Chloe produced her first flame and Sammy first recognized the flow of her own ven from meditation."
0,"However, Justin still could not feel the ven in his body."
0,"Chapter 16
“A place to call home”"
1,Mid-February approached and with it the snowiest time of the season.
0,Temperatures hovered at 30° Fahrenheit with an average snowfall of two to three inches a day.
0,"Due to the constant freezing temperatures, the snow piled up day after day."
0,Snowplows forced the snow to the sides of the road into large banks that were sucked into an even larger vehicle to be taken outside the city.
0,The bus Justin and Eydis rode trailed behind one such pair of vehicles on its way to the university.
0,Eydis stared with excitement at the strange new machinery.
0,“We never get snow in Amel.
0,Those machines are amazing!
0,Do they clear all the roads?
0,Where do they put the snow?”
0,Justin looked forward to these moments of childlike excitement.
0,"As the weeks went on, they became fewer and farther between."
0,The last one was earlier the previous week when Eydis discovered Sammy had an elemental affinity to water.
0,"Eydis treated Sammy, Chloe, and Justin at a diner to celebrate."
0,"The next day when Justin and Eydis went shopping, she also bought Sammy a value-sized box of fruit snacks as a celebratory gift."
0,Justin wished desperately that he could be a cause for such excitement in Eydis.
0,"As the days pressed on, Justin felt that Eydis’s attempts to help him feel his ven left her frustrated and that the daily purging of the toxic ven his body produced was becoming a chore for her."
0,"Eydis was now paying her share of rent and covering her portion of the food, although her food expenses amounted to very little."
0,She even paid her own phone bill despite Sammy’s claim that it wasn’t needed.
0,There was nothing Justin was doing for her anymore.
0,"Eydis once spoke of repaying her debt to him, but by Justin’s estimation, she had already far overpaid him."
1,Justin and Eydis exited the bus at the usual university stop and made their way to the humanities building.
0,They took the elevator up and knocked on Dr. Shuman’s door.
0,They only came to Dr. Shuman when either he or they learned of something that might hint of others from Eydis’s world appearing.
0,"The last time they visited, Dr. Shuman brought up the possibility that the increase in missing persons cases on the news might be tied to those who were looking for Eydis, but there was never any evidence other than the increase occurring shortly after Eydis’s arrival in Gullivan, so there was little they could do, and it might be unrelated."
0,Dr. Shuman agreed to investigate further.
0,"That was the reason Justin and Eydis expected they were called, but instead, Dr. Shuman addressed another topic."
0,“It’s not an emergency or anything.
0,Is Eydis still living with you?”
0,"“I am,” Eydis replied."
0,“Then I guess you did not secure a room at the change of the semester.
0,"I don’t know if you are still interested, but there is a vacancy in a two-person room of the girl’s dormitory right now."
0,I was able to place it on hold for you if you want it.
0,"You are not a student, but you are working here now, so an exception can be made.”"
0,"To Justin’s surprise, Eydis showed no excitement or any emotion at all."
0,"“I see,” was all she said."
0,Justin followed up on Dr. Shuman’s announcement.
0,“What building?” He had completely forgotten to look for openings when the new semester came around.
0,There were sure to be many.
0,"Then again, Sammy never brought it up either."
0,"Before he had realized, Eydis living in his apartment had simply become the natural state of things."
0,"“Four,” Dr. Shuman replied."
0,Building four placed Eydis on the opposite side of the complex from Sammy.
0,"At least it was closer to campus, and having Sammy closer to Eydis would be a greater benefit to her."
0,Perhaps Sammy could even arrange a bed swap with the other inhabitant of the room.
0,“That’s pretty good news.
0,"You should take him up on the offer.” Justin smiled at Eydis, but the look he received in return was one of shock."
0,"Eydis’s eyes shifted from Justin, to the floor, and back to Justin."
0,"She was about to speak but instead stood up and walked out into the hall, closing the door behind her."
0,"Justin looked at Dr. Shuman dumbfounded, hoping for an explanation."
0,Dr. Shuman leaned back in his chair and stroked his chinstrap beard.
0,"“I have an idea what just happened, but it’s between you and her.”"
1,Eydis ran.
0,"She did not know where to, but she had to find a place to be alone before her emotions overcame her."
0,"Sammy’s words kept repeating in her head, that she could find a new home with Justin and Sean."
0,"She had clung to the hope Sammy gave her after losing her family, her nation, and her very world."
0,She had done everything that Justin had asked of her.
0,"She followed every single one of Sean’s terms for her to stay, every term except searching for her own place to live."
0,"But, did she not already find her place with them in their home?"
0,Did her desire to earn her place there not fulfill that condition?
0,Eydis found herself standing in a small lounge down the hall on the opposite side of the building from the elevators she normally rode.
0,Wide windows overlooked the campus.
0,"In the faint reflection of her face only inches from the glass, she could see the water building in her eyes."
0,What did I miss?
0,"Eydis mouthed, realizing now just how hard the rejection hit her."
0,She had lived all her life struggling to live up to the impossible expectations of her father and her people.
0,She felt crushed under that weight.
0,"Now on Earth after losing everything, she found happiness in a life free of such a burden."
0,That was her mistake.
0,The burden did not disappear.
0,The source of the burden only changed.
0,"“I was a fool to think that Justin’s welcoming nature meant his expectations of me were any less…” Eydis whispered to herself, trying to keep her lips from quivering."
0,"She had grown lax, taken Justin’s kindness for granted, and now he wanted her gone."
0,Her fears were right all along.
0,She was an inconvenience to him.
0,His expectations of her were not the burden.
0,I am the burden…
0,"Justin appeared from the hall, flustered, and spotted Eydis at the window."
0,"She saw him in the window’s reflection, but she could not turn and meet his eyes."
0,“Eydis.”
0,"Eydis hesitated to turn and face him, but if she did not respond, she would only inconvenience him further."
0,"Eydis turned, not hiding the emotion in her eyes."
0,“Eydis?”
0,Her eyes drifted down to the floor between them.
0,“I expected it.
0,I knew it would happen eventually.
0,"It is your apartment, and I have made you sleep on the couch for over three months now.”"
0,Justin scrambled for something to say.
0,“I was just thinking you could live with Sammy and closer to where you work.”
0,"“Sean told me to get a job, so I got a job."
0,"He told me to pay for rent, so I paid for rent."
0,"You spent more money to feed me, so I paid for my food."
0,"You asked me to help you select healthier food, so I helped you buy food."
0,"You asked me to help around the apartment, so I helped clean."
0,I did everything I could so I could stay.”
0,The grand Amelian Palace flashed in Eydis’s mind.
0,"She saw the faces of her mother, Ceil, Symra, and all her servants."
0,A tear ran down Eydis’s cheek.
0,“I can sleep on the couch.
0,You can have your bed.
0,I do not need it.” 
0,A second tear fell down the other cheek.
0,She saw the flare light from her window.
0,"She heard the assassin’s words, that she brought this upon herself."
0,She saw the palace guards die while she fled.
0,She saw her brothers dead in the central courtyard.
0,Eydis’s speech quickened.
0,“I have been a bad teacher.
0,I will work harder to help you feel your ven.
0,I will work harder to help you find your element.
0,I will try harder so you can learn to remove your toxic ven.” 
0,"She remembered Emer’s portal, her fear of this unknown world, and the biting cold that first night that could have killed her just as easily as the assassin."
0,“I will do all the cleaning.
0,I will learn to cook.
0,I will pay for all the food.
0,I will pay for all the rent.
0,I will do anything…” 
0,"And then she felt again the arms supporting her, the blankets laid on her, and the warm smile under deep blue eyes telling her that everything will be okay."
0,"“Please,” Eydis begged Justin."
0,“I cannot lose another home… Not again…”
0,"Before Justin realized his own actions, he embraced Eydis."
0,"Eydis’s breath was strained and ragged, something Justin had not seen since the first weeks Eydis lived with him."
0,He was reminded that Eydis had to make an active effort to even breathe in Earth’s atmosphere.
0,She was not from this world.
0,"Everything new was exciting to her, but it was also foreign and terrifying all the same."
0,“I’m sorry.
0,I’m sorry.
0,"I didn’t realize,” Justin said."
0,Eydis leaned down and rested her forehead on Justin’s shoulder.
0,"“Please…” she repeated, trying to hold back her emotions as she clung tight to the sleeves of Justin’s coat."
0,“You don’t have to go anywhere.”
0,Justin walked Eydis to the sofa adjacent to the window and sat her down.
0,"Eydis still clung to him with her head bowed as low as she could, causing flashbacks to when Eydis begged him not to call the police that morning months ago."
0,"She was terrified then, and she was just as terrified now."
0,Justin hated himself.
0,"He felt that these months he spent with Eydis had been erased and they were back to the first day he met her; all the fun, laughter, and excitement replaced by a fear of isolation and abandonment the same as when she first found herself in a strange and unfamiliar world."
0,"No, it’s worse, he realized."
0,With all the effort Eydis made to secure herself a place with the people who showed her kindness and took her in…
0,I threw it back in her face and told her to leave.
0,“I’ll tell Dr. Shuman that you will be staying with me.”
0,"After explaining the situation to Dr. Shuman, Justin returned to Eydis who had not moved from her seat."
0,“Dr. Shuman understood and will be releasing the hold on the bed.”
0,Eydis nodded.
0,"Justin wanted to do something to make up for the pain he caused Eydis, but there was little time before he and Eydis would have to walk over to the health and fitness building to prepare for the self-defense class."
0,Justin held out his hand.
0,“Let’s go.”
1,"* * *
The heavily salted walkways crunched under their feet."
0,"Despite the salt, Justin could see a couple of students slip on the slick pathways as he scanned the campus grounds in thought."
0,"Sammy would not arrive until just before the class started, so Justin was left on his own to try and find a way to make amends."
0,"Eydis had already eaten her one light meal for the day, so treating her to dinner was out."
0,There was a food cart that sold hot drinks along the way.
0,"Justin could at least give Eydis something warm, but he had done this multiple times before, so he did not feel that it would work well as an apology."
0,"Even so, he still bought Eydis a small mint hot chocolate with cream."
0,"When they reached the health and fitness building, Eydis excused herself and handed Justin the half-empty hot chocolate."
0,"He thought it a waste to toss it, so he finished it off."
0,"Eydis liked the mint flavor strong, so it was a bit overpowering for him and numbed his tongue."
1,Justin removed his coat and unlocked the room.
0,He rolled out the mats and pulled out focus mitts from storage.
0,The lesson for this week was practicing strikes that create openings to escape an attacker.
0,"Although he was not being paid, he always set up the class while Eydis changed--a small gesture to make Eydis’s job easier and to fill the time while he waited."
0,Eydis was nearly seen with her tail and ears while changing in the early days of attending the self-defense class.
0,Sammy worked with Eydis to locate a changing room with personal stalls to help keep her identity hidden.
0,"Eydis had suggested using a bathroom stall, but Sammy absolutely refused to force Eydis to change in such a dirty place."
0,The changing room she found on the other side of the building was seldom used due to being more separate from the exercise and other sports facilities.
0,It also had three private stalls.
0,No one would see her elven traits there.
0,Little by little the students showed up for the class.
0,"Chloe walked in with a brown-haired, pixie cut, heart-shape-faced woman and walked over to greet Justin who had just sat down against the wall."
0,Sammy arrived with Dr. Calliby right when the class was supposed to start.
0,"When everyone wondered where Eydis was, she came in last with a clear face that showed no signs that she had been crying, but once the class started, many of the students noticed something was bothering her."
1,Eydis began her class as usual with warmup and then instruction.
0,"Justin knelt against the wall below the windows into the hall in his own meditation under her instruction, meditation that wasn’t helping him gain any deeper understanding of his ven."
0,The time came for the first demonstration.
0,"Out of habit, Eydis almost called out to Justin to join her up front, but she stopped herself half-way into sounding the “J”."
0,"Her beckoning hand hung frozen in the air, and she slowly retracted it."
0,Justin disliked acting as the assailant.
0,All this time she had been troubling him.
0,"He even set up the class for her each day, and she could not remember ever thanking him for it."
0,"All her life, others had taken care of such menial tasks out of duty to her as a princess, so she never thought anything of it."
0,"But Justin wasn’t her servant--quite the opposite, he was her savior."
0,What have I been doing all this time?
0,"Eydis stood silent, sending confused and worried stares bouncing between her students."
0,"The class had to continue, but she could not ask Justin to help."
0,"The moment Eydis was about to ask Dr. Calliby to help with the demonstration, Justin broke his meditation and opened his eyes."
0,He saw her staring at him.
0,His eyes met hers for only a moment.
0,"In one swift motion, he pulled himself to his feet and exited the room through the door beside him, pulling his coat with him as he left."
0,"Eydis felt the weight of all her wrongs against Justin pulling her to chase after him and apologize, but the worried stares of her students rooted her in place."
0,How do I make this up to him?
0,Eydis felt she would drown in her guilt.
1,"Eydis was troubled, and Justin knew he was the cause."
0,"She kept forgetting what she was going to say, and after a long pause that was far too uncomfortable for him to continue meditating, he knew he had to leave."
0,Her stare when he opened his eyes proved that his presence only distracted her.
0,He donned his coat as he left the building and walked into a small clearing around the corner from the entrance.
0,There he knelt in the snow to continue his meditation.
0,The best thing he could do for Eydis was focus hard and show her that the training she was providing worked.
0,"He knew people walking by would look at him with questioning stares, but he did not care."
0,He zoned out the world around him.
0,"When the feeling painlessly left his legs, he focused on any sensation he could detect beyond the numbness."
0,"He tried and focused, tried and focused."
0,Every few minutes he pinched his leg to see if he could feel a flow different than the numb tinge of pain that wracked his nerves.
0,"After what felt like an hour, he made no progress, the same as every other day."
0,"Justin pulled out his phone and saw that only about twenty minutes had passed, not an hour."
0,His rush for results was making him lose focus.
0,Justin breathed deep and relaxed.
0,He did not pinch his leg anymore.
0,"He stayed in the proper position with his hands clasped in his lap and concentrated only on the feelings in his legs, or lack thereof."
0,"He continued for over an hour, letting Sammy or Eydis find him and call for him to stop."
0,He was out in the open and not in any hidden location.
0,They would find him quickly.
0,"Another hour passed by, then another."
0,"Justin thought that the class should have ended long ago but expected Eydis to stay behind and talk with Sammy, Chloe, and the others."
0,"They might even be doing Chloe’s--and now also Sammy’s--magic lesson, but this thought worried him because he always kept watch to make sure no one walked in on them."
0,Justin opened his eyes and pulled out his phone.
0,Only a few minutes had passed since the end of the class.
0,Something didn’t feel right.
0,He wiped his face and shakily stood.
0,The circulation now returned to his legs quickly after becoming accustomed to kneeling.
0,"“Justin!” Sammy stomped across the deep snow towards Justin, fuming."
0,“What did you do to Eydis?”
0,“Let’s go.”
0,"The snow on the ground was dry, but the snowball that hit him in the face was wet, slushy, and stung."
0,"“She kept staring at the door after you left, and Maddi had to take over for the rest of class.”"
0,Sammy marched closer and tossed another snowball.
0,"This one traveled slower than the first, so Justin avoided it with ease, but his movements were also slower."
0,"“Wait,” Justin pleaded."
0,“I can explain.” 
0,"Sammy tried to grab him, not giving him a chance to speak, but she was slow in the deep snow, so Justin moved his sluggish body out of the way."
0,Eydis appeared from the corner of the building with Chloe and Chloe’s new friend.
0,She saw Sammy attacking Justin and hurried to stop them.
0,"“Sammy, wait…”"
0,Sammy swung her fist at Justin who dodged the slow attack.
0,"Eydis’s face lit up in excitement, and the radiant smile of discovery that Justin had longed for grew on her face."
0,But Eydis’s words were not what he expected.
0,“Sammy!
0,Do not stop!
0,Keep going!”
0,"“Gladly,” Sammy replied, ready to flatten Justin if only she could find the chance."
0,Justin could not believe what he heard.
0,Was Eydis that angry at him?
0,A small crowd of students gathered on the walkway to watch the fight.
0,Sammy swung at Justin.
0,"When Justin moved to dodge, his body grew slow again, but so did Sammy’s punch."
0,The punch missed by a large margin.
0,The trade of slow swing and slow dodge continued.
0,Sammy grew more and more irritated from being unable to land a single hit.
0,"She reached for Justin’s arm, but Justin batted her hand away and stepped back."
0,"Justin’s foot caught on something beneath the snow, and he tripped backwards."
0,"Sammy did not miss the opening and dove on top, straddling him."
0,Justin had nowhere to move.
0,He wished he had taken part in the self-defense class to learn how to escape from being pinned.
0,"Sammy swung at Justin, and all he could do was watch the slow punch make contact with the full impact of a real one."
1,"* * *
Justin woke to a warm feeling on his cheek."
0,He looked up and saw Eydis leaning over him with an apologetic smile.
0,She removed her hand from his cheek and greeted him.
0,“How do you feel?”
0,Justin was back inside the self-defense classroom.
0,"Sammy sat against the wall below the window behind him with a scowl on her face, and she avoided eye contact."
0,Justin sat up and saw that Chloe and her friend were with them as well.
0,“Hold out your hand.” Chloe’s friend came over and placed her hand palm-down over his.
0,“Another?
0,"I feel nothing,” he said."
0,Eydis smiled as if she expected the result.
0,“Humans have a single affinity if any at all.
0,Miriam has an earth affinity.
0,"With this, we can safely say that you have no affinity to any of the natural elements.”"
0,Justin wiped his face with his hand and exhaled a large sigh.
0,All Eydis’s efforts and his large ven capacity had gone to waste.
0,Sammy lifted her head up.
0,“Don’t give up just yet.” 
0,Justin looked to Eydis for an explanation.
0,“What does she mean?”
0,Sammy pulled herself to her feet using the window’s metal frame.
0,“I think it would be easier to show him.
0,"Justin, stand in the middle of the room.”"
0,Justin complied with Sammy’s orders.
0,"She looked at him, her face filled with disgust."
0,“Don’t worry.
0,"If I hit you, Eydis will fix you right up.”"
0,Justin had no time to prepare.
0,Sammy ran straight at him and swung the strongest haymaker she could.
0,Justin panicked at first but noticed the swing slow down as it approached.
0,"He easily turned to the side and avoided the hit, even though his body was slow reacting to his intentions."
0,Sammy stumbled having missed her target but managed to find her footing.
0,“Were you seriously trying to punch me!?
0,What if it hit!
0,"?” Justin shouted, but then he realized something."
0,"He had thought their fight in the deep snow was what caused both Sammy’s and his movements to be so slow, but that explanation would not work here."
0,“I seriously wanted it to.” Sammy grabbed Justin’s shirt and pulled his face close to hers.
0,Her voice was quiet but saturated with anger.
0,"“I had long given up on finding somewhere for Eydis to stay because I understood her fears and anxiety, but the first opportunity you get, you send her packing."
0,I hope you realize how bad that must have made her feel.
0,I honestly wish I could have punched you a few more times.”
0,Justin took a deep breath and returned with Sammy to the group.
0,"He knew he hurt Eydis, and she had every right to be angry at him, but she was not that type of person, so Sammy was acting as Eydis’s proxy."
0,"“Eydis, sorry about earlier,” Justin began, but Eydis cut him off and prompted him to sit in front of her."
0,She did not want to change the subject.
0,“The natural elements are all around us.
0,There is no easy way to tell when someone uses magic of those elements unless you see or feel the result of the spell.
0,Life magic is included in this for the same reason.
0,Life is everywhere.
0,"If you have a life affinity, you can sense life if you are specifically looking for it, like when I assess the quality of food, but unless you know the exact life magic you are looking for, you will not notice it."
0,"However, there are affinities outside the natural elements and life magic that force noticeable changes on the world.”"
0,Eydis held out her hand.
0,“Try to touch my hand.”
0,Justin reached out but found a solid force blocking him from coming within a few inches of Eydis’s hand.
0,“Spatial magic is one of these.
0,"Those who are sensitive to ven or have trained their sensitivity can feel when someone near them uses these rare, world-altering magics."
0,"The three rare, world-altering affinities are space, gravity… and time."
0,"I felt something when you were defending yourself, but it was weak.” "
0,Eydis’s eyes fell to her lap.
0,"“I am sorry for telling Sammy to keep fighting you, but I could not let her stop."
0,I had to be certain about what I felt.
0,I think you have an affinity for time magic.
0,I will make it up to you.
0,I promise.”
0,Eydis dropped her head apologetically.
0,Her shaking hands gripped his sleeve.
0,"The effects of Justin’s actions earlier that afternoon still weighed heavily on Eydis’s heart, and now she was distraught for telling Sammy to hurt him."
0,His mind raced to find a way to make amends when the words Eydis had just spoken struck him.
0,"“Wait, wait."
0,Lift your head.
0,You said time magic?”
0,"Eydis raised her head with a weak, forced smile."
0,“Yes.
0,"You do not have any control over it because you cannot control your ven, but your meditation might have made your body become accustomed to it, so you use it without thinking.”"
0,“How rare is time magic?” Justin asked.
0,“Very rare.” Eydis spoke with a hint of jealousy growing in her shaky smile.
0,"“Life magic is the most common of the rare affinities, but only because there are many species that can use it naturally, like High Elves."
0,Next is spatial magic.
0,"Time magic is the second rarest, and it is completely unheard of for a human to possess it."
0,"The rarest is gravity, the affinity my first instructor specialized in."
0,She was the only one in the entire empire who could use it with any level of skill.
0,Most people with this affinity can do nothing more than make small objects a little heavier or lighter.
0,There were maybe one or two others in recorded history who could use it anywhere near as well.”
0,“So that means…” Eydis nodded.
0,"“We finally know what your affinity is, and it is incredibly rare.”"
0,Justin was elated.
0,He pulled Eydis into an embrace.
0,He spoke softly his feelings of regret for his actions earlier that day.
0,“I’m sorry for what I put you through.” He hugged her a little tighter.
0,“And thank you.
0,Thank you for doing all this for me.”
0,"A single tear fell along Eydis’s cheek, and she wrapped her arms around him."
0,"They held this position for a moment, but because either he or Eydis began feeling self-conscious of the onlookers, they mutually parted, but Justin still held his hands on Eydis’s shoulders."
0,He looked into her watery eyes.
0,"“Your place will always be with me, if you can put up with my thick-headedness.”"
0,Eydis nodded with a bright smile and wiped a tear that was about to fall.
0,"“Everyone thought it was a lover’s spat, and turns out that’s exactly what it was."
0,"Keep it out of class next time, okay?” The unfamiliar voice came from the extra person in the room and was answered by Sammy."
0,"“That is not what happened,” Sammy deflected."
0,"Justin realized that Chloe’s friend, Miriam, was listening to their entire discussion."
0,"Miriam’s face glowed with a vibrant, childlike smile."
0,He let go of Eydis and looked worriedly at Sammy and Chloe.
0,“Is it okay for her to hear all this?” Justin asked.
0,"Sammy wrapped her arm around Miriam’s waist, and Miriam in turn rested her arm around Sammy’s shoulders."
0,"“Once she found out she could use earth magic, she confronted us after class and pretty much guessed everything, including that Eydis was an elf and possibly from another dimension."
0,"We had to give in, or she was going to pull off Eydis’s headband in front of everyone.”"
0,"“Nice to meet you, Time Lord,” Miriam said with a giggle."
0,“I am a witch.
0,Word on the wind says you are involved in something very dangerous.”
0,"Chapter 17
“Revelry and Understanding”
Justin"
1,“““Congratulations!””” A group of women cheered around the table of a secluded booth in the corner of Eydis’s favorite diner.
0,Justin’s face grew a slight shade of pink from the feminine cheer of his congratulatory party.
0,"Eydis, Sammy, Chloe, and the new addition, Miriam, each held their respective glasses."
0,"Justin finally knew his magic affinity, and it was not just a rare affinity; it was one of the rarest of rare affinities, time."
0,"He had requested postponing the party due to his inability to control his ven, or to at least include Miriam in the focus of the celebration due to the discovery of her earth affinity, but his idea was shot down by both Eydis and Miriam."
0,“None of you really have a grasp on your magic yet.
0,"And we held a party for Sammy once we found her affinity, yes?”"
0,"“Time is much more amazing than earth, and I kind of forced myself on all of you anyway.” "
0,"After Eydis and Miriam’s rebuttal, Justin became the sole focus of the party."
0,"The clank of each member’s choice drink echoed lightly in the booth, and the party was under way."
0,Chloe and Sammy were the only two without an alcoholic beverage accompanying their dinner.
0,“Why couldn’t you have waited a month to find your affinity?
0,I would have liked to drink with you.” Sammy looked at her old-fashioned cherry cream soda with mild disappointment.
0,"Chloe only smiled with her raspberry lemonade in hand, extra raspberries."
0,It was almost a smoothie.
0,"Chloe was the youngest of the group, being only 19 years old."
0,"Sammy was next, turning 21 at the end of March."
0,"Eydis was the oldest by a large margin, but her refugee card stated her age as 21, the age Dr. Calliby mistook her for on Eydis’s first day in the class."
0,"Her birthday was set for June 21st, the closest approximation they could make after Eydis said she was born on the first day of the warm season of her world."
0,Justin followed at the age of 23 and also had a March birthday.
0,Miriam was the oldest non-elf in the group but refused to divulge her age when talking about drinks.
0,Sammy snatched Miriam’s license when she presented it to order her drink.
0,Miriam had just turned 26 in January.
0,"“We could have made it a birthday celebration for me and Justin too,” Sammy continued."
0,“You already had your party.
0,It’s Justin’s turn.
0,We can always have another.” The mild-mannered Chloe found enjoyment in Sammy’s sulk.
0,“You do not need to be mad at Justin anymore.
0,Everything is fine.” Eydis beamed at Sammy.
0,She knew that Sammy’s mood was in part due to the misunderstanding between Justin and Eydis earlier that day.
0,"“For now, enjoy the party."
0,"I am paying for everything, so do not feel reserved."
0,I have no use for the money I am saving.”
0,“This keeps getting better and better!” 
0,Miriam’s excitement grew a magnitude larger.
0,She immediately opened the menu and began scanning it for her meal.
0,This prompted a small chuckle from Eydis before she took a swig of her tequila.
0,Justin saw it during Sammy’s party but was still surprised that Eydis never got drunk no matter how much alcohol she consumed.
0,He added it to his list of features that proved Eydis was an elf.
0,"When he asked why she chose alcohol if she could not get drunk, she simply answered that she liked the taste."
0,"Apparently elven ale was far stronger, and even tequila would almost pass as a children’s drink."
0,Justin smiled at Eydis before taking a sip of his own cheap lager with only a 3% ABV.
0,"Although he hated to admit it, he was a bit of a lightweight."
1,"Orders were made, and food was delivered."
0,“How the hell can you even eat that much?”
0,“Umm… Magic?” 
0,“You could give any competitive eater a run for their money.” 
0,Miriam chuckled at Sammy and Chloe’s exchange.
0,"Chloe, who required her own body’s energy to convert her raw ven into fire ven, had an extremely high metabolism that she needed to support, but she managed to eat enough to fill out her features and keep from becoming skinny."
0,She ordered an entire family platter for herself.
0,It had a full course of meat samples as well as three sides.
0,“I’m starting to wish I had a fire affinity.
0,"I just don’t have the stamina to keep up with my magic for long.” Miriam’s earth affinity was physically taxing, wearing her out rather quickly."
0,"“But on the positive side, I’ve never had a bad night’s sleep since I found I could use it."
0,Been sleeping like a baby for the past two days.”
0,"“Yah, you both have benefits, but I get nothing from mine,” Sammy moaned."
0,“It’s not as nice as you think… My food costs have gone through the roof.” Chloe popped a medium-well strip of steak smothered in spicy barbecue sauce into her mouth.
0,Her cheeks blushed from the flavor or possibly the heat of the sauce.
0,"After swallowing, she continued speaking while cutting another slice."
0,“You only have to drink more water.”
0,Sammy looked at the three glasses next to her gourmet burger and blooming onion.
0,"Two were for water and already had been drained once each because of how much she practiced in their magic lesson just before the party, causing a dehydration headache and a stern lecture from Eydis."
0,The third was for her soda which was currently on its second refill as well.
0,Eydis assured Sammy that the amount of her body’s water that ven conversion consumed would decrease little by little as her control over the conversion process improved.
0,“I guess.
0,But I was hoping there would be more benefits after seeing how much you changed in one weekend.”
0,Sammy noticed Eydis eyeing her blooming onion and broke off a petal for her.
0,Eydis dipped it in the special house sauce that sat in the center.
0,One bite sent her feet tapping with glee.
0,"Eydis did not order a meal, having already eaten that morning."
0,She was waiting for everyone to finish and order desserts.
0,The main reason she loved this diner was their wide variety with varying portions for each dessert.
0,"Justin had suggested it initially, knowing Eydis’s sweet tooth."
0,He was introduced through a girl he dated briefly in the past.
0,The diner had a separate menu book specifically to house their selection.
0,Eydis could choose any dessert in a small portion and wanted to try them all eventually.
0,“What about life… magic?” Miriam’s question split between bites of her chili-loaded fries and chicken strips.
0,“Are there any passive benefits to… a life affinity?”
0,Eydis reached for another petal of Sammy’s blooming onion but paused to think of an answer.
0,“Longer life?
0,I think that would be the answer you are looking for.
0,"Many people think High Elves live longer than other elves due to a difference in their biology, but that is incorrect."
0,We live longer because life ven helps our bodies.
0,It keeps us healthy.
0,The few High Elves without an affinity for life magic live no longer than other elfkind.
0,"Dryads are better at life magic, and with a different biology too, they live many times longer than High Elves.”"
0,“Any negatives?” 
0,Justin decided to join the conversation instead of working down his massive Philly cheese steak.
0,“No negatives.
0,But life magic is very dangerous.
0,"In the past, life and death were thought to be different affinities."
0,They are actually the same.
0,"Life magic, if used for harm or without proper skill or knowledge, can do terrible damage and even kill."
0,Life magic can heal a wound or prevent a wound from healing.
0,"Also, if healed without proper control, the body’s regeneration goes out of control which can lead to sickness and eventually death if not caught.”"
0,“What about Justin’s time affinity?” Miriam voiced the question before Justin could.
0,"“Sorry, but I do not know."
0,"It might not have any effect on the body, like spatial magic.”"
0,"“Hey, anyone want this?” "
0,Sammy broke up the conversation to offer the remains of her blooming onion after taking a deep breath from filling up on her burger and drinks.
0,"Everyone but Chloe passed, claiming they were saving room for dessert."
0,Eydis did claim the single petal she had reached for earlier.
0,Chloe happily took the remaining fourth of the onion.
0,She already finished her family platter.
0,Miriam watched Chloe in disbelief.
0,“Where does it all go?”
0,"“Her boobs, of course."
0,Look at them!
0,Even though they shrunk a little when she lost weight.”
0,"“Wha… what are you saying in front of Justin?” Chloe’s face flushed pink, and her eyes darted between Sammy and Justin."
0,“Come on.
0,Any man his age shouldn’t get flustered over boobs.”
0,"Justin’s mind drifted to the day he had found Eydis, but there was nothing arousing about her situation back then."
0,He then recalled one time he had seen Sammy naked when she tried to urge him into sex.
0,“See!
0,See!
0,He’s blushing!
0,He was thinking about it!” Chloe pointed a blooming onion petal at Justin with her fully extended arm as if it was her own accusatory finger.
0,Justin snatched it from Chloe’s hand and ate it.
0,He quickly wiped the thought from his mind.
0,That night was the turning point in his relationship with Sammy that eventually led to the break-up.
0,Sammy gawked at him in disbelief.
0,“How much of a virgin are you?”
0,Justin tapped the dessert menu on the side of Sammy’s head.
0,“Stop picking on Chloe.
0,And I’m not a virgin.”
0,"“Wait, then why…” Sammy’s eyes widened in surprise and then squinted in frustration."
0,"“Okay, details.”"
0,"Miriam leaned forward, also wanting to hear the juicy stories of Justin’s past."
0,"Chloe’s eyes darted from Sammy to Miriam, begging them to stop."
0,"Eydis only admired her dessert menu, her undivided attention seemingly focused on deciding what she would get, but Justin thought he saw Eydis’s ear twitch beneath her beanie."
0,"Justin’s mind recalled memories without his permission, but he cut them off when he felt his mood sour."
0,“I’d rather not.
0,It’s not something I like to talk about.
0,It would only spoil the party.
0,It was a long time ago anyway.”
0,Justin picked up another dessert menu and thrust both at Miriam and Sammy.
0,They each grabbed it with disappointed faces.
0,Chloe alone looked relieved.
0,He then joined Eydis as she scanned her menu.
0,“Any idea on what to try this time?” Justin asked.
0,"“I have only had four of their desserts so far, but they were all rather similar."
0,I want to try something new.”
0,Eydis bought a miniature slice of pie each time they came to the diner.
0,The pies were the first section on the dessert menu.
0,She was simply going down the list.
0,Justin scanned the second page.
0,His eyes fell upon a boxed section in the bottom left corner.
0,"Twelve ice cream flavors were listed, but it was the picture next to them that caught his eye."
0,"Eydis had never tried ice cream before, and this would be the best introduction he could think of."
0,“How about this?”
0,Justin pointed to the tapioca deep-fried ice cream.
0,Thick tapioca pudding was encased in an ice cream flavor of choice and then quickly deep-fried with gram cracker breading.
0,It could then be topped with any of seven different sauces.
0,"Justin had never tried it himself, but the description alone made his mouth water."
0,Eydis read the description.
0,"Her eyes lit up, and she thrust the menu into Justin’s face, the picture about an inch from his nose."
0,“This!
0,I will get this!”
0,"Eydis returned to the menu, but after some thought she deferred to Justin."
0,“I will let you choose the flavor.
0,"You will know better than me what will taste best, yes?”"
0,"Justin thought that Eydis would know better than him what flavors she liked, but he agreed to her request."
1,"Once everyone decided their respective desserts, they flagged a waiter over and placed their orders."
0,"When the desserts arrived, the party mood picked up again."
0,Chloe chose a fruit parfait that stood so high from the glass that it threatened to topple over.
0,"Sammy, who was already full from her dinner, chose only a small blackberry tart."
0,Miriam chose a specialty chocolate shake with chunks of chocolate truffle and a little rum mixed in.
0,Eydis and Justin both chose the deep-fried ice cream.
0,Justin’s had three scoops of dark chocolate ice cream with a salted caramel sauce.
0,The flavor he chose for Eydis’s single scoop was in-house mint ice cream with an apricot glaze.
0,Justin watched with bated breath as Eydis cut the ball of ice cream with her spoon.
0,"She took great care to make sure her scoop contained a bit of tapioca pudding, mint ice cream, caramelized and crunchy gram cracker crust, and yellow apricot glaze."
0,The ice cream was soft and only slightly melted from the flash cooking in the fryer.
0,"Eydis lifted the spoon to her mouth and bit down, pulling the spoon out slowly."
0,She made no reaction.
0,"Justin worried that his choice of flavors did not sit well with Eydis, but then a smile crept over her face."
0,It grew wider and wider until her whole countenance glowed.
0,“…mmmMMMMMM!” Eydis grabbed the sleeve of Justin’s shirt and shook him while stomping her feet.
0,“Justin!
0,Justin!
0,Try it!”
0,Eydis filled her spoon again making sure that each ingredient was present.
0,"She held it in front of Justin’s mouth, her eyes beaming with joy, eager to share what she had just experienced."
0,Justin felt a little embarrassed with Sammy and Chloe Staring at them.
0,Miriam alone focused on Eydis and chuckled.
0,“She’s so cute!”
0,Justin decided to ignore them and clamped down on Eydis’s spoon.
0,Eydis pulled it out slowly and watched for Justin’s reaction.
0,The flavors Justin chose had little reason to them other than Eydis’s love of mint.
0,He thought he remembered somewhere that mint paired well with pitted fruit.
0,This proved it.
0,"Chills ran down his spine, and he felt a light lift in his chest."
0,The dessert could only be described in one word: heavenly.
0,"Almost forgetting to breathe, Justin smiled back at Eydis."
0,“That was really good.”
0,Eydis beamed back at him again and continued eating her ice cream.
0,"Remembering that Eydis wanted to try all the desserts the diner offered, he took a scoop of his own deep fried ice cream, making sure each ingredient was on his spoon, and offered it to Eydis."
0,She looked at him surprised.
0,“Go ahead.”
0,"Eydis leaned over, held her hair back with one hand, and took a bite."
0,An exact repeat of her previous performance ensued.
0,Justin’s shaking arm nearly dropped his spoon.
0,“What is this?
0,They are the same dessert but taste so different.
0,It is nothing like the pies!”
0,"Pleased with her cute reaction, Justin began eating his own dessert."
0,“He does things like this so casually but the moment you try to cuddle he pushes you away…” Sammy let out a sigh and popped the last bite of her tart in her mouth.
0,"When desserts were finished and Eydis confirmed that everyone was satisfied, she took care of the check, and with one final congratulatory cheer, the party came to a close."
0,"Chapter 18
“A School of Magic”
Eydis"
1,Eydis continued in high spirits on her return to the apartment after eating her prized desserts.
0,"When she saw Sean reading on the couch, she hurried over to him unable to contain her excitement."
0,“Sean!
0,Have you ever tried fried ice cream?”
0,Sean looked up from his book.
0,“You have quite the sweet tooth.
0,"Sadly, I can’t eat it.”"
0,“You do not like it?” Eydis grew confused.
0,How could someone not like something that tastes so good?
0,Sean shook his head.
0,"“I like it, but my body doesn’t."
0,I am lactose intolerant.”
0,Eydis’s confusion deepened.
0,Sean closed his book without placing anything inside to mark his location and looked up at Eydis.
0,"“Lactose is a sugar present in milk, the main ingredient for ice cream."
0,My body does not produce enough of an enzyme called lactase to digest it.
0,"If I eat anything with milk, I get rather sick.”"
0,“Could you help him with your life magic?” Justin asked.
0,"Eydis learned a little about enzymes from joining Sammy in her biology class while Justin was working, so she understood Sean’s explanation well enough, but she did not know any life magic that could help."
0,"Healing with life magic was done through abstraction of the healing process, letting the life ven fill the acute gap in one’s understanding of the fine details of biological processes."
0,Biology worked through its own natural order.
0,Life magic manipulated that order.
0,Healing a wound simply required the knowledge that healing was a natural process of life that could be controlled through life magic.
0,That minimum required knowledge was what Eydis lacked.
0,She knew nothing of the natural processes of lactose or lactase.
0,She shook her head.
0,“No.
0,"I know what enzymes are from Sammy’s class, but I do not know anything about lactose or lactase."
0,I would not know where to start or what to do.
0,Sorry.”
0,“Don’t worry yourself over it.
0,It’s not a big deal.” Sean reopened his book to the exact page he had closed it and continued reading.
1,"After another apology, Eydis followed Justin into her room."
0,"Justin had accepted her into the apartment and stated that her place was with him, that this apartment was her home, but he was not the only resident."
0,Sean still expected her to find a place of her own as one of his requirements for her to stay--a supposedly temporary state that had lasted for months now.
0,"Eydis was distressed when she thought Justin kicked her out and was relieved when she learned that it was all a misunderstanding, but the risk of eviction was still real with Sean."
0,That realization brough with it a return of her anxiety creeping up on her like a haunting shadow.
0,Expectations.
0,Obligations.
0,Burdens.
0,Eydis forced her worries from her mind.
0,Today had been a tumult of emotions.
0,She sat on the bed and beckoned Justin to join her.
0,“Let us take care of your ven poisoning.”
0,Justin removed his shirt and sat next to Eydis.
0,"Due to his decision to eat healthier with Eydis’s help, some of his excess fat had diminished."
0,"However, his stomach bulged slightly from the large dinner he had just eaten."
0,His failed attempt to suck in the bulge was amusing.
0,"He was clearly self-conscious about it, so Eydis acted as if she did not notice."
0,"At least the sight help uplift her spirits again, even if just a little."
0,It was charming in its own comical way.
0,Eydis placed her hand on Justin’s nearly hairless chest and used life magic to reduce any physical feeling in Justin’s body.
0,"The feeling of ven was separate from physical senses, which was why the meditation Eydis made her students perform caused the body to numb."
0,"Using life magic to numb Justin to all physical sensations was an extreme version of this, something she thought up after his meditation was not helping him feel his ven."
0,Her goal was to allow Justin to feel the expulsion of his toxic ven and nothing else.
0,"Justin leaned forward and rested his forehead against Eydis’s, and she placed both hands on the sides of his face."
0,"“I am starting,” she announced."
0,Silence.
0,“Did you feel anything?”
0,"“No, same as usual,” Justin replied."
0,Eydis could not deny how frustrating Justin’s lack of progress was.
0,He should have been able to feel something by now.
0,But she could only smile.
0,She expected as much.
0,"If she could convince Sean to let her stay here permanently, she would have all the time she needed to guide Justin, however long that would take."
0,She released her grip and placed her hand back on Justin’s chest.
0,Justin shivered as warmth spread through his body with the ebbing of the numbness.
0,He retrieved his shirt and stood with his back to Eydis to hide his bulging stomach once again.
0,“Maybe there is something about me that makes it impossible to feel my ven.
0,Do you think that I might have some form of ven paralysis?” he asked while pulling his shirt on.
0,Eydis did not like that line of thinking.
0,It was no different than resignation.
0,"His question annoyed her, but then again, nothing she thought of was working, so she could not help but feel Justin’s inability to feel his ven was due to her own inadequacies."
0,“I have never heard of such a thing.
0,"Paralysis only affects the physical body, yes?"
0,Ven is separate from that.”
0,"Even if such a paralysis did not exist on Whinhlem, that did not rule out the possibility of people having it on Earth."
0,Now Eydis had to chastise herself for following the same defeatist line of thinking.
0,She grabbed her pillow and tossed it at Justin out of mild frustration from him putting such thoughts in her mind.
0,Justin turned in time to see her pillow flying at his face.
0,"He dodged it with impossible reflexes, and it bounced off the wall behind him."
0,Eydis felt the faint sensation of time magic use.
0,"She knew next to nothing about time magic, which made guiding him all the more difficult."
0,She exhaled a defeated sigh.
0,"“Even though you cannot feel it, your body recognizes it much better now that you are aware of it and can use it without thought on your part.”"
0,"She fell back diagonally across the bed, narrowly avoiding hitting her head on the wall on the other side."
0,Justin retrieved the pillow and sat down next to her.
0,“I wish Evhial was here.
0,"She would have a far better idea of what to do,” Eydis groaned."
0,Justin dropped the pillow on Eydis’s face.
0,“Don’t worry yourself over it.
0,"The problem is with me, not you."
0,I know you are doing everything you can.”
0,Eydis hugged the pillow to her face.
0,“Can I have your hand?”
0,Justin did not reply.
0,"Perhaps he was hesitant at the request, or her voice was muffled through the pillow, so he heard wrong."
0,She extended her hand towards him and asked again.
0,"She felt him grasp it gently, not unlike when he was reassuring her that everything was alright."
0,"Perhaps he thought she was low in spirit, and that was why she asked."
0,"Her emotional state, which was low if she wanted to be honest with herself, was not the reason, but she appreciated the gesture all the same."
0,"She smiled, her face safely hidden under the pillow."
0,Eydis sent a pulse of life ven up Justin’s arm to his shoulder and then through his body.
0,"After a few seconds, she sent another."
0,"“Nothing is different,” she said after a pause."
0,“Huh?”
0,"The pillow muffled Eydis’s voice, so she removed it and sat up still holding Justin’s hand, seeking the small comfort and assurance it offered."
0,“Nothing is different about your body from the last time I checked.”
0,"“When was that?” Justin couldn’t pin a time or place to the memory he had of the pulse, which was understandable given the circumstances then."
0,"“When you had your migraine, I had to search your body to find out what was wrong."
0,Nothing has changed since then.”
0,"Again, Justin was confused, so Eydis elaborated."
0,“Everyone was interested in the changes that using magic does to your body.
0,"I did not know about time magic, so I wanted to check.”"
0,“Perhaps you were right about time not having any affect.” Eydis shook her head.
0,“It is still too soon to tell.
0,"My instructor, Evhial, her constant use of gravity magic drastically shortened her life."
0,Using gravity magic creates very small injuries in the body that go unnoticed and build up over time.
0,This was completely unknown before she discovered it.
0,There was no one who used gravity magic as much or as well as her at any time in history.
0,"Even with her life affinity improving her health, eventually it became too much for her body to bear."
0,She only lived about half as long as she should.”
0,“Are you worried that time magic might have a similar problem?” 
0,Her grip on Justin’s hand tightened.
0,Justin’s problems with his ven were connected to an incurable condition that in the worst case could be fatal.
0,Now she also learned he had a powerful affinity.
0,"The more powerful the affinity, the more dangerous it was for the user."
0,"Life and spatial magic were dangerous because without incredible skill and practice, injury and even death could result from use."
0,"With gravity, though incredible skill was still required, it also damaged the user just by using it."
0,The discussion at the party brought the realization that teaching Justin how to use time magic could potentially cause him harm.
0,Humans already had incredibly short lives compared to elves.
0,"If there was any similarity between gravity and time magic, or even if time magic did not cause direct harm but was dangerous if used without learning from a proper instructor, Eydis wanted to avoid hurting Justin."
0,"“You don’t need to worry about that,” Justin answered after Eydis explained her worries."
0,"“It’s my decision, and I want to continue."
0,Miriam is right.
0,The fact that I can use time magic is amazing.
0,Who would want to stop?”
0,"Eydis smiled, but the shadow of concern darkened her expression."
0,“How about this?
0,"In the next magic lesson, you explain everything you just told me and let everyone decide if they want to risk continuing."
0,"If someone wants to stop, they can stop."
0,But I honestly don’t think any of them will.”
0,This unwavering positivity was just like Justin.
0,"Only now did Eydis realize that his question about ven paralysis was out of simple curiosity, not out of frustration or defeatist mentality."
0,She was the only one being defeatist.
0,"After a fun dinner with her new friends at her favorite diner, she went and made herself anxious and depressed all over again with worries."
0,Eydis’s grip on Justin’s hand tightened again.
0,Assurance.
0,A genuine smile grew on Eydis’s face.
0,“Okay.”
1,"* * *
“You worry too much.”"
0,“We already made our choice.” 
0,"“Thank you for worrying about us, though.” "
0,"Sammy, Miriam, and Chloe each turned down Eydis’s offer to stop the lessons."
0,They all sat down on the couch in Miriam’s studio apartment and had listened to Eydis spill her concerns.
0,"All Eydis’s worries that she had two evenings ago were invalidated by the simple optimism of her friends, but she couldn’t help but feel frustrated by their lack of concern for their own safety."
0,"After all, she was the one who started their training."
0,"They were her responsibility, and thus so was their safety."
0,Their eagerness simply meant that Eydis had the obligation to see their magic training through and protect them no matter the outcome.
0,"Now that Justin was included in the lessons, he could no longer keep watch at their former vacant classroom in the health and fitness building."
0,"Miriam lived alone and volunteered her apartment, so long as Chloe was careful not to set anything on fire."
0,"When Miriam suggested they use her apartment, everyone was curious what a witch’s apartment would look like, but reality shattered their fantasies."
0,“What were you expecting?
0,Candles and bones everywhere?
0,Random effigies decorating the furniture and walls?” Miriam laughed.
0,The small room looked like any other college student apartment.
0,The blue carpet was lightly stained in places.
0,The furniture was cheap.
0,Her futon was threadbare in the corners.
0,The small kitchen-dining corner was slightly disorganized and a little messy.
0,Not a single clue that would lead one to suspect Miriam was a witch could be found.
0,“We’re just like anyone else.
0,I was raised in a normal home with normal parents and just happened to have an interest in my grandma’s hobby.
0,She’s the real witch in the family.
0,"I was just an apprentice, so to speak.”"
0,"“Your parents don’t practice witchcraft,” Sammy asked."
0,Miriam shook her head.
0,“They don’t believe any of it.
0,"I learned quickly as a kid that my grandma knew things she shouldn’t, more so than the stereotypical grandma that sees through everything."
0,That’s what piqued my interest.
0,"She couldn’t use magic or anything, but she claimed to be able to speak to spirits and nature, as could her mother and grandmother."
0,She’s the reason I came to this school.
0,Said I was destined to meet the Master of Time and the Bridge between Worlds.
0,Doom and danger!” Miriam swung her hands dramatically and stopped abruptly with a shrug.
0,“That sort of thing.
0,"It was the craziest thing I had ever heard from her, but she had never been wrong before.” "
0,Miriam smiled at Justin and Eydis.
0,“Turns out she was right again.
0,Although I’m not sure about the danger part.”
0,"Eydis expressed interest in meeting Miriam’s grandmother, but Miriam informed her that she passed away two years ago."
0,"Determined to become her vision of a true witch, one who could use magic, Miriam was excited to continue her official lessons."
0,"“Our discussion at Justin’s party made me think about the benefits of each of your elements,” Eydis began, first addressing Sammy."
0,“You thought that a water affinity lacked benefits when compared to a fire affinity.
0,"You are only unaware of what a water affinity can do, so I thought I would teach you all convenient ways to use just your ven in its elemental form without the need to conjure anything from it."
0,A perfect example is what Chloe discovered almost immediately.
0,"Anywhere she concentrates her fire ven, she becomes resistant to heat.”"
0,"“So, something more than making rocks?” "
0,Miriam held a perfectly monochromatic tan stone in her hand that was not there a few seconds before.
0,Eydis was surprised that Miriam could already conjure rocks.
0,She ran before even learning how to crawl.
0,Chloe followed Miriam’s example by producing a small flame of her own and had it dance across the tips of her fingers.
0,This spurred a bit of jealousy from Sammy who was the only one unable to consciously conjure something physical with her ven.
0,"For Sammy’s lesson, Eydis handed her a bag of cotton balls and told her to infuse one with her ven."
0,"Infusion was no different than ven affinity assessment, because in its simplest form, what they were doing during those assessments was send their ven into another’s hand."
0,"After that brief explanation, Sammy felt confident she could do it."
0,The crux of Eydis’s lesson was that Sammy needed to control her ven well enough that it didn’t accidently produce water and get the ball wet.
0,This proved frustrating.
0,"While Sammy could not produce water at will, her ven often created moisture on its own, getting herself or others wet."
0,"Still, she continued as a bowl of soggy cotton balls slowly filled up."
0,Miriam’s lesson involved concentrating as much of her ven as possible on a single circle drawn on the back of her hand in washable marker.
0,"The ability to move ven willingly through the body was a prerequisite for affinity assessment and infusion, so Miriam thought that this would be easy; however, Eydis stated that the ven needed to be uniformly distributed and extremely concentrated."
0,"Even though the process was simpler than Sammy’s, the needed precision and control was higher."
0,"Each time Miriam thought she had it, Eydis touched her hand and told her that it was nowhere near sufficient."
0,Chloe was ahead of everyone else in her ability to control and use her ven.
0,"Having already learned how to gather the ven to resist heat and agitate it to warm objects, Eydis told Chloe to slow it to a complete stop."
0,She had to transfer ven to her hand and then prevent it from moving.
0,This was a unique challenge for Chloe due to how hyperactive Chloe’s ven was.
0,The level of control required was much greater than both Sammy and Miriam.
0,"Like Miriam, Eydis would touch Chloe’s hand and say Chloe’s attempts were not good enough."
0,"Even though Justin participated in the magic lessons now that he knew his affinity, he could do nothing but continue meditating with the hope that he might eventually be able to feel his ven."
0,He did not have even the smallest amount of control like the others.
0,"Eydis apologized, but she could not think of anything else, and Miriam rejected the idea of randomly throwing objects at Justin in her apartment."
0,"While everyone practiced, Eydis quickly learned to use the web browser on her phone and then delved into the molecular biology textbook she asked Sammy to bring."
0,The lesson finished without anyone making any progress.
0,The following Monday’s lesson had the same result.
1,"By Wednesday, Eydis gave Chloe passing marks, but barely."
0,"Given the relative difficulty of Chloe’s lesson due to Chloe’s unique ven constitution, she felt a little leeway was needed."
0,She also wanted to inspire the others by showing the results.
0,Everyone gathered around Chloe to see the results that Eydis kept secret.
0,“You probably think a fire affinity is only used to produce and manipulate fire.
0,"To be more precise, it manipulates energy."
0,"Thermal energy is energy, yes?” "
0,"Eydis asked Chloe to hold out her hand, palm facing up, and sat a half-filled water bottle on it."
0,"“When you first showed us your magic, it was like this."
0,You heated a bottle of water.
0,"Now, do what you practiced.”"
0,Chloe nodded and channeled fire ven into her hand but brought it to a standstill.
0,The water bubbled slightly but soon clouded.
0,Eydis grabbed the bottle and gave it one solid shake.
0,Frozen slush filled the bottle.
0,Everyone grew wide-eyed in amazement.
0,“You mean ice is not water magic?” Chloe asked.
0,"“Water magic can conjure ice, but you can also produce ice with fire magic by removing thermal energy from water.”"
0,"“That’s not quite how thermal dynamics works,” Sammy quipped."
0,"“Actually, it might be,” Justin quipped back, prompting a glare from Sammy."
0,“I think Chloe is just absorbing the thermal energy from the water.”
0,Eydis handed Chloe the bottle.
0,“You can now not only keep your food hot but also keep your drinks cold!”
0,Chloe was elated with this revelation.
0,"For the remainder of the lesson, she continued reheating the bottle only to freeze it again."
0,"This pleased Eydis, because more than anyone else except perhaps Justin, Chloe needed to learn control over her affinity."
0,"This training was the most basic form of control: temperature regulation, a necessity for any fire mage to keep their magic from spiraling out of control."
0,Eydis worried about how Chloe’s hyperactive ven would inhibit her ability to control it.
0,"Like Justin, Chloe’s constitution was something Eydis had never seen, and she had no one to ask about it."
1,"Sammy and Miriam redoubled their efforts after seeing Chloe’s success, and Miriam received passing marks by the next lesson."
0,"“Grab your sharpest knife,” Eydis ordered."
0,Miriam pulled a knife out of one of her kitchen drawers and returned to the group.
0,"“Once you have your ven concentrated on the back of your hand, try to cut it with the knife.”"
0,“Cut it?” Miriam repeated worriedly.
0,“Trust me.
0,"If this fails, I can heal you.”"
0,“You saying that doesn’t make it easier…” 
0,"With Eydis’s reassurance, Miriam slid the blade over her hand."
0,"“Harder,” Eydis ordered."
0,Miriam applied more pressure and pulled the knife across.
0,Miriam’s mouth hung agape.
0,She began sawing the back of her hand with the blade.
0,"The skin stretched and pulled with each motion, but it never cut her."
0,“Now make a fist to tighten the skin and try to stab it.”
0,"Without hesitation, Miriam plunged the knife into her hand."
0,“Shit!” Miriam recoiled and dropped the knife.
0,"“God damnit.” She cradled her hand and winced from the pain, but when Sammy quickly pulled her hand away to see the damage, there was no mark."
0,"From how Miriam reacted, everyone but Eydis had thought she stabbed herself."
0,Eydis retrieved Miriam’s aching hand and massaged it with life magic.
0,“Earth ven can be used to protect the body from being cut or pierced.
0,It can deflect swords and arrows better than conventional armor with less strain on the body than the weight of metal armor.
0,But it is not perfect.
0,"As you learned just now, you will still feel pain.”"
0,"“How much of my body can I coat with it?” Miriam asked, enjoying the life-magic-aided hand massage."
0,“Your entire body with enough practice.
0,"Even your internal organs can be protected, but that is far more difficult."
0,"Only, do not try it on your eyes unless you have no other choice."
0,It causes temporary blindness.”
0,Miriam spent the remainder of the lesson concentrating her ven on different parts of her body and then poking them with the knife to test the quality of her reinforcement magic.
0,Sammy was the only one unable to complete her training.
0,"Still failing to keep the cotton dry while infusing it with ven at the end of the next lesson, she began carrying a bag of cotton balls with her everywhere."
1,"Late Sunday evening, Justin sat shirtless next to Eydis during their daily purge of his toxic ven."
0,“Eydis!
0,Are you here?!”
0,Sammy walked in the front door and called out.
0,“Done.”
0,"Instead of removing the ven slowly to give Justin more of a chance to feel it, Eydis rushed the purge."
0,"She stood and trotted out the door, leaving Justin alone on the bed."
0,Justin worked his way in an unsteady crawl out the door and down the hall.
0,His numbness removed most of his motor functions.
0,"“Eydis, you kind of left me on the bed there.”"
0,“What?” Sammy stared at the shirtless man crawling into the kitchen from the hallway.
0,His slender frame with near-perfect complexion had none of the excess fat she remembered.
0,“On the bed?
0,What were you two doing before I arrived?
0,He would never try to make a move on you.”
0,Justin rolled over on his back.
0,“Quite the opposite.
0,I can barely move as it is.”
0,Eydis hurried over with an apology and placed her hand on Justin’s chest.
0,Justin stood with a helping hand from Eydis and walked with her back to Sammy.
0,"“And you could knock for once,” Justin chastised."
0,"“What, it’s not like I would be interrupting anything.”"
0,"“As you can see, we were in the middle of something.” "
0,“What was Eydis doing to you?” 
0,Justin was relieved that she had not asked what he was doing to Eydis.
0,"“You wouldn’t do anything, so it had to be her.” Sammy looked at Eydis with suspicion."
0,Eydis’s explanation was short and direct.
0,“Removing poison from his body.”
0,“Poison?” Worry grew on Sammy’s face.
0,"Sammy already knew of Justin’s large ven capacity, so he filled in the blanks about how this was due to his body’s tendency to turn the ven it absorbed into poison and that Eydis purged it every day to keep it from building and causing his migraines."
0,“No wonder you are having such a hard time with your ven.
0,Your body can’t even absorb it correctly!
0,"The two are probably linked,” Sammy mused."
0,"“It is possible,” Eydis agreed."
0,"“So, why are you here,” Justin asked Sammy."
0,“Oh!
0,Yah!”
0,Sammy held out her hand.
0,A puff of mist appeared in her palm that slowly swirled and grew until it condensed into water.
0,"With a flick of her middle finger, the small ball of water the size of a marble flew directly into Justin’s face, prompting a light chuckle from Eydis."
0,“I was able to channel my ven into the cotton without getting it wet when I realized that the exact opposite of what I was doing would condense the ven and turn it into water!” Sammy grabbed both Eydis’s hands with excitement.
0,“So what’s this special use that you were teaching me with the cotton?”
0,Eydis was genuinely pleased with Sammy’s progress but rejected her plea to reveal the secret.
0,“Conjuring water was a result I hoped would follow.
0,"You are correct that the processes are opposites of each other, just like Chloe’s heating and cooling."
0,You will have to wait for tomorrow’s lesson so everyone can see.”
0,“Come on.
0,Please!”
0,"Eydis shook her head with a playful smile, and Justin interjected."
0,“You should have known Eydis would not spill it early.
0,Or did you come all the way here just to get me wet?”
0,"“Now that you’ve lost some weight, a damp look might actually suit you well,” Sammy laughed."
0,“I don’t need to go back.
0,It’s fine.
0,I’ll just stay with Eydis tonight.
0,"Eydis doesn’t mind, right?”"
0,Eydis shook her head.
0,She was excited to have another night talking with Sammy.
0,Justin shrugged and let Sammy do as she pleased.
1,"The next magic lesson, everyone gathered around Sammy as she conjured a small sphere of water."
0,"“Now I won’t fall behind,” Sammy asserted."
0,"Amid the congratulatory praise from Miriam and Chloe, Eydis appeared carrying a large bowl filled with water and set it down on the carpet between everyone."
0,“Take a cotton ball and fill it with your ven.”
0,Sammy grabbed a cotton ball from the bag beside her and channeled her ven into it.
0,"The first attempt was a soggy failure, but the second kept the ball dry."
0,“Now dip it in the water.”
0,Sammy submerged the cotton ball completely and pulled it out to the surprise of everyone but Eydis.
0,It remained dry.
0,"She dunked it again and again, and even squeezed and massaged it under water, but the cotton ball would not get wet."
0,"Water beaded off as if it had been sprayed with a perfect waterproofing agent, one that even prevented droplets of water from clinging to the fine fibers."
0,Sammy’s hand alone got wet.
0,"“Now, instead of channeling your ven into the cotton ball, coat your hand with it."
0,It does not need to be uniform like with Miriam.”
0,"Sammy did as asked, and the water on her hand beaded off into her lap."
0,“Shit.” She quickly moved her hand over the bowl to keep her pants dry.
0,“I can repel water?”
0,"“If you were to coat your body and clothes with it, you would stay dry in even the strongest rain.” "
0,“Waterproofing?
0,That’s useful.” Miriam pulled at the cuffs of her pants that had gotten soaked from the snow.
0,“It is more than waterproofing.
0,"Sammy, with the ven still coating your hand, put your hand in the water.”"
0,"Sammy tried, but her hand would not enter the water."
0,“Hey!”
0,“Sammy…” 
0,"Sammy slapped the water, sending droplets at Miriam and Justin, but she could not submerge her hand."
0,It looked like Sammy was slapping a water balloon.
0,“It’s like a barrier is keeping my hand out.”
0,"“Just like you reject the water, the water rejects you."
0,If you were to coat it on your feet…”
0,Sammy’s face bubbled with the joy of what she was about to say.
0,“I’d become Jesus!” 
0,"“If controlled correctly, you can even propel yourself through water at incredible speeds.” "
0,"Sammy was an avid swimmer, something that Eydis knew well."
0,Sammy’s body shook with unrestrained excitement.
0,She was unable to keep herself from laughing.
0,Tears of joy welled up in the corners of her eyes.
0,"“A water affinity is useful, yes?"
0,It does not lose to fire or any other element.”
0,"Sammy wrapped her arms around Eydis, jumping on her knees with excitement."
0,She looked the happiest that Eydis had ever seen her.
0,Sammy’s joy alone made the magic lessons worth it.
0,"Eydis did not want to ruin Sammy’s celebration, but she also had to continue the lesson, so while Sammy still clung to her, she announced the plan for the rest of the evening."
0,"“For the remainder of the lesson, Sammy and I thought we should focus on Justin."
0,There is a small park two blocks from here.
0,We will continue there.”
1,"Everyone left the apartment, and Miriam led them down the street to a small park with a playground and a single swing set."
0,The far corner was a small field with two metal picnic tables.
0,"The snow was about two feet deep, and several snowmen built by the neighborhood kids populated the field."
0,"No one else was in the park so late in the evening, so they had it to themselves."
0,"Once Justin followed Eydis into the field, a snowball hit the back of Justin’s head."
0,"When he turned to find Sammy gathering another, Eydis threw one at his back."
0,She smiled playfully.
0,"“Your time magic doesn’t activate if you are too distracted,” Eydis analyzed."
0,"Justin was not an uncommon topic in Eydis’s night talks with Sammy, mostly brought up by Sammy in anecdotes."
0,This lesson focusing on Justin was Eydis’s idea born from their discussions.
0,"Now aware, Justin successfully dodged a pair of snowballs fired by Sammy and Miriam."
0,“Four against one time mage?
0,Seems fair to me!” Miriam giggled maniacally and handed a snowball to Chloe.
0,The snowball fight erupted immediately and continued until Justin was too exhausted to fight back.
0,"Except for the first two snowballs, no other was able to hit him."
0,"In the end, Justin was the sole victor, although Eydis was never hit, because she used wind magic to deflect any snowball Justin threw at her."
0,"Before returning to Miriam’s apartment for hot drinks, Eydis checked Justin’s ven levels."
0,"Despite using time magic for nearly the full half hour of the snowball fight, Justin never ran out."
0,"The fight didn’t even make a noticeable dent, much to her surprise."
0,"At the end of the lesson, everyone said their goodbyes and parted ways."
1,"At the bus stop, Eydis tugged on Justin’s sleeve."
0,“May we stop at the store on our way back?” she asked.
0,“Sure.
0,What do you need to get?”
0,“Ice cream.
0,Do you know what flavor Sean might like?”
0,Justin flashed an understanding smile.
0,He knew she had been absorbed in something on her smartphone but never asked what.
0,They picked up three personal-sized cups of ice cream and headed home.
1,Sean sat on the couch in his usual one-leg-over-the-other posture reading a book.
0,Eydis walked over to him with a nervous smile.
0,"“Sean, if you do not mind, can you lay back and pull your shirt up?”"
0,"Sean closed his book and obeyed, albeit with suspect."
0,"“This should not hurt, but it will probably feel hot.”"
0,Eydis placed her hand on Sean’s abdomen.
0,His eyes winced a little but relaxed soon after.
0,"When finished, Eydis pulled him back up to sit."
0,“What did you do?” Sean asked.
0,Justin brought over the bag and pulled out the three cups of ice cream.
0,“Normally you would ask that before someone uses magic on you.
0,Which one do you want?”
0,Sean stared at the ice cream.
0,His eyes narrowed in disbelief when he realized what Eydis did.
0,"“Your body should produce sufficient lactase now,” Eydis said with a warm smile."
0,"During every purge of Justin’s toxic ven after learning of Sean’s lactose intolerance, Eydis had scanned Justin to investigate lactase levels and activity in humans."
0,"Using Justin’s lactase levels as a guideline, Eydis learned everything she could about lactase, where and how the body produced it, and theories about why the production levels decreased."
0,She used her own body as a test subject until she was sure she could reproduce the change safely in Sean.
0,Sean grabbed the chocolate mint ice cream and finished off the entire cup.
0,All Eydis’s preparation led to this moment.
1,She waited in deep anxiety into the night hoping that Sean would not grow ill from eating the ice cream.
0,Eydis knocked on Sean’s door as Justin was preparing for bed in the living room.
0,"When Sean answered, Eydis saw that she had pulled him away from working on something on his computer."
0,"“Sorry to bother you while you are working,” Eydis said."
0,“I wanted to ask if you had any problems with the ice cream.”
0,“None.
0,Your magic is amazing.
0,Thank you.”
0,Now was the time.
0,"Eydis still felt she had more to repay for Sean letting her stay considering her inability to follow all his conditions, but if she did not ask now, she felt that she would never fully feel welcome here, that this apartment would never be her home."
0,Eydis took a deep breath and readied her conviction.
0,“You said after Justin found me that I needed to find my own place to live.
0,I want to know if I have done enough to earn my place here with you and Justin.
0,I want to know if I can call this place my home.”
0,Sean’s face went blank and then slowly grew frustrated.
0,He exhaled slowly through his nose and paced once in a circle before sitting on his bed and staring at his feet.
0,"His actions worried Eydis, and she wondered if she had insulted him by asking."
0,"“Have you been worrying about that all this time?” Sean took a deep breath, and his frustration melted."
0,“I guess this is my fault.
0,I never thought you would agonize over that for this long.
0,I gave that condition before knowing anything about your situation or who you are.” He looked up at Eydis.
0,“I wouldn’t have let you use magic on me if I did not trust you.
0,"You are a good person, and that is reason enough for me to let you stay.”"
0,"Sean smiled warmly, an odd sight from his usual stone-faced expression."
0,"“So long as Justin is okay with whatever living arrangements you two have decided on, you can stay as long as you want."
0,I was wrong to urge you to leave.
0,Sorry to make you worry for so long.”
0,Eydis dove to her knees in front of Sean and hugged him.
0,She felt an immense weight and worry lifted from her.
0,"“Thank you,” she said while trying to hold back her tears."
0,This small apartment by the river was finally home.
0,"Chapter 19
“Ignorance is bliss”
Eydis"
1,“I think you are good enough now.
0,"If you wait any longer, Jethro might find your sister.”"
0,"Austin sank back into the sofa and ordered his new fairy slave, Jil, to grab him a flask of ale and Dyas to massage his shoulders."
0,At least a large fire crackled in the fireplace to keep everyone warm in their underdress.
0,Symra and Wian huddled together on a rug near the fire to soak in the warmth.
0,Symra coddled Wian who was taking a well needed rest.
0,"The heavy bruising on Wian’s stomach, ribs, and breasts were finally fading now that Justin’s angry beatings ceased with the new arrival, a gift from Jethro at Eydis’s request."
0,"Once Austin came to some conclusion that Wian orchestrated a plan to distract him while Eydis could gain permission to steal Rynn, he began regularly beating her."
0,The poor Forest Elf may have been the sole target of his rage because she reminded him of the slave he lost and because he lacked the strength to physically harm Symra or Dyas no matter how hard he tried.
0,"Eydis did not know if Austin’s obsession with Rynn was because of her size or age, but because fairy women were similar in stature to Elf youth, she hoped the addition would spare Wian further abuse."
0,"Austin seemed pleased with the replacement, and the new addition lessoned the beatings over time."
0,"Eydis felt terrible forcing another innocent woman into bondage, but considering the ongoing genocide in Vallen, the fairy’s fate was either death or slavery, and Eydis was unsure which was preferable."
0,"At least as a slave, if by some miracle the humans lost their hold on Amel, she could be saved."
0,"Austin disgusted Eydis by his every action, but she also understood that this was the fate of a female slave."
0,"There was nothing she could do to stop him without monitoring him every moment of every day and night, and she could barely stand being in the same room as him for her English lessons."
0,The best she could do for them was to take him away.
0,"“Seriously, though."
0,"English is one of the hardest languages of our world to learn, and you mastered it in a couple weeks.” Austin continued speaking jovially without a care towards the mournful faces of the women."
0,“Then I will tell Jethro we are ready to leave for your world.”
0,Eydis stood from her chair and walked to the large double doors.
0,"While waiting for the guards to open them, she glanced back at the small fairy being fondled in Austin’s lap while the fairy futilely attempted to serve him his ale."
0,The man laughed at the sounds and expressions he could force out of the poor woman.
0,"“Humans are repulsive, all of them.”"
1,"* * *
The next day."
0,Jethro called Eydis and Austin to the grand council chamber where he met them sitting casually atop the arm of the emperor’s throne.
0,"Two humans, a dwarf, and a giant stood beside him."
0,They dressed in warm clothes similar in make to Austin’s aside from the giant who wore a large cloak of crude Tolmyurin fabric.
0,"In the otherworld city where only general humans lived, finding clothing that could fit one of his stature would be impossible."
0,Jethro prepared this special task force to both assist and monitor Eydis.
0,She knew the dwarf was a magician that had mastered his single affinity.
0,One if not both humans could likely use magic.
0,"The giant, taller and larger built than any of the giants Eydis had seen in the palace, was probably weaker than her in strength, but due to his military training that Eydis lacked, she did not doubt he could overpower her and pin her down if she was weakened."
0,The dark eyes of the giant followed Eydis as she approached but wandered to the head poking out from behind her.
0,Eydis brought Rynn against Jethro’s orders.
0,Jethro scratched under his ear and shook his head lightly.
0,“I reluctantly caved to your request to allow our valuable English instructor to accompany you.
0,I cannot permit another.
0,This is no vacation.
0,I am sure you understand that.
0,I can give my word that the girl will not be harmed while you are away.”
0,"Eydis expected resistance, so she planned what she felt was a justifiable excuse."
0,“I need someone to replenish my ven and I refuse to use Austin or your men.
0,And I cannot believe Rynn will be safe until I return.
0,"You may give your word, but did you not tell me your men are disobedient?"
0,There is nothing you can say on this matter that I can trust.”
0,"“Watch your tongue,” the dwarf reprimanded calmly while the two humans drew their swords in anger."
0,The giant was unfazed by Eydis’s defiance and kept staring at Rynn.
0,"“Fine, fine,” Jethro sighed."
0,"After calming his angered men with an unamused wave of his hand, he opened a strange black portal."
0,"He felt no need to argue against Eydis’s reasoning, much to her relief."
0,The dwarf entered the portal first followed by the massive giant who had to duck and carefully shift his way in to not touch the edges of the portal.
0,"Austin moved to line up for the portal, but as he passed, Eydis caught a faint whiff."
0,"She grabbed his arm, pulled him back, and retrieved the sachet of deshalu from his pocket."
0,“Are you mad?” she reprimanded.
0,“What if the princess smells an herb from her world?” Eydis tore the sachet and dumped the dried grass with bubbled growths onto the floor.
0,Jethro glared.
0,He had also prohibited the herb.
0,Austin could say nothing in his defense.
0,He silently entered the portal behind the taskforce.
0,"Eydis looked into the deep void that failed to show the destination, and it filled her with trepidation."
0,"“Thank you for noticing the deshalu,” Jethro said once everyone else had left."
0,“Lurr senses are better than ours.
0,"If Austin happened to find the princess first, that would have been an immense risk.” "
0,Eydis did not move.
0,"She stared at the portal and tried to understand its construction, why the destination was not visible."
0,"The destination of every portal was visible, or should be."
0,This portal was aberrant.
0,It was unnatural.
0,Something was horribly wrong about it.
0,“The portal is not dangerous despite appearances.” he assured after a pause.
0,"“Don’t let a meager portal ruin your conviction,” he said with a dimpled smirk."
0,Eydis doubted Jethro would let her investigate the trace to get a better understanding of the formula.
0,She tightened her grip on Rynn’s hand and pulled her through the void.
1,"The portal felt like trying to step through a thin membrane that once penetrated, became a cold and viscous fluid."
0,"It pushed back against her like a current, but at the same time it pulled her through by some unknown force."
0,The sensation churned her stomach.
0,The other side of the portal was no better than the traumatizing passage through it.
0,The air of the small residence was cold and thin like the top of an exceedingly high mountain.
0,She found breathing painful and grew dizzy.
0,She had to wonder how the princess was able to survive in such a place.
0,Rynn also felt the effects of the atmosphere and held her head.
0,"The petite girl’s legs grew weak, so Eydis quickly lifted her."
0,"A simple wooden chair with a glossy polish sat next to a dark, hardwood table."
0,"She sat Rynn down in the chair to let the dizziness pass, if it would."
0,"Eydis worried that it would linger indefinitely, and they would be forced to grow accustomed to it."
0,Strange objects Eydis had never seen before filled the room around her.
0,The wash basin and what she assumed was a range suggested that the room was meant for preparing and eating meals.
0,"The make and quality of the appliances was exquisite, despite the obvious wear of time."
0,She walked to the counter and prodded an appliance with a large metal bowl and whisk.
0,"It had to be for mixing ingredients, but there was no way to use the whisk."
0,It was attached at the top to the strange appliance.
0,"As she groped around the object out of curiosity, her hand bumped something, and the whisk immediately spun at an incredible speed."
0,She yelped in surprise and panicked to find a way to stop it.
0,The dwarf pushed a set of clothes into Eydis’s arms and deactivated the machine.
0,"“Change,” the dwarf ordered in Elven."
0,“You will draw attention in that dress.”
0,Eydis looked around.
0,"Certainly, they could not expect her to change here."
0,"While wondering how she would manage to change clothes in front of all these men, a stubby dwarf hand pushed her towards a hallway."
0,“There is a room down the hall.
0,I will guarantee your privacy.
0,Return when you are finished.
0,We have much to discuss.”
1,Eydis carried Rynn with her to the hall but took a moment to glance back at the machine that had spun the whisk on its own.
0,They said this world had no magic.
0,"The room at the end of the hallway was adorned simply with a bed, side table with a lamp, a dresser, and a vanity stand with a perfectly reflective oval mirror."
0,"The small size of the room made it feel awfully cramped, at least compared to the large rooms of the palace."
0,"Like the dining room before, everything inside bore the weathering of age and poor maintenance but remained of incredibly fine quality."
0,The former resident was either an elderly human of this world or had inherited the furniture.
0,Eydis asked Rynn to sit on the bed while she dressed.
0,Rynn found it just as soft if not softer than the bed they had in the palace.
0,She pressed her hands into the pillowed fabric and bounced lightly a few times.
0,"Even though the girl showed no emotion, Eydis knew she was surprised."
0,"“I wonder if all humans of this world live in such luxury or if the owner saved enough to afford such luxuries,” Eydis thought aloud to Rynn, hoping to elicit some emotive response, but as usual the girl neither answered nor showed any outward emotion."
0,Eydis sat the clothes on the bed next to Rynn.
0,"After removing her sandals, she unfastened the back ties of her dress and sash about her waist to let the dress fall to her ankles."
0,"The Dwarf provided her with a pair of blue pants similar in fabric to those worn by Austin, a simple white shirt, and a thick brown coat that was torn in a few places."
0,"Upon closer inspection, there were small, thin slits in the back."
0,The coat formally belonged to someone Jethro’s men had killed from behind.
0,"After inspecting the pants and finding they lacked similar markings, Eydis realized that her underskirt would not pair with the pants, so she removed it as well."
0,"The room was not heated, so she shivered lightly while she dressed."
0,"The blue pants hung loose on her waist, rubbing against her tail whenever she moved."
0,"The sensation was unpleasant, but there were no ties on the waistband of the pants, leaving a single button as the sole fastener."
0,Eydis had to question the design of only having one button and leaving no means to loosen or tighten the waist.
0,There was also a large hole below the button that exposed her if she was careless in how she moved or walked.
0,Wouldn’t such a method of fastening be better suited on the back or side instead of the front?
0,Eydis felt inside the hole for any means to seal it and noticed fine metal teeth.
0,She ran her fingers up and down and located a small tab on the bottom where the teeth joined.
0,"While fiddling with the tab, the teeth clamped together when it rose."
0,"Fascinated by the fine craftsmanship, Eydis repeated the motion over and over, feeling the teeth enter the tab separate but leave the tab conjoined."
0,It was incredible technology that felt just as much like magic as the whisk in the kitchen but was used on something so small and seemingly insignificant.
0,"Ties would accomplish the same task, but instead this world used a magic tab on simple clothing."
0,"The pants still hung loose and low on her hips, but there was little she could do."
0,She would have to endure the rubbing on her tail.
0,"The white shirt was also loose, and the coat was made for someone much wider than her, but at least the sleeves were long enough."
1,"Now dressed, Eydis returned to the dining room, leaving Rynn in the bedroom."
0,“What’s the plan?” Austin’s eyes scrutinized Eydis’s baggy apparel.
0,“Do as I say.
0,That is all.” 
0,Eydis ignored his gaze.
0,She spoke to Jethro’s men in Elven to keep Austin out of the conversation so he wouldn’t say anything unnecessary.
0,She did not trust him to keep silent nor did she know who of Jethro’s men spoke any English.
0,"The dwarf briefed Eydis on their current coverage of the city, but she paid little attention."
0,"All reports Jethro received from this world he forwarded to her, including the city coverage."
0,"Jethro’s men followed a high level of secrecy, so she doubted the thoroughness of their search."
0,"If Austin’s supposed leads came up empty, she would likely have to begin her own search from the beginning anyway."
0,Eydis returned her attention to the briefing when the dwarf began mention of a public transportation system that was not included in the reports.
0,"She could use a large, automated carriage called a bus to move around the city quickly to prevent the princess from being alerted to any use of spatial magic."
0,He handed her a small card with the explanation that it should give her free access if she tapped it on the pedestal inside the carriage.
0,His final orders were to return at sundown and gave Eydis freedom to investigate as she pleased so long as she did not confront the princess should she locate her.
1,"* * *
Austin followed a few steps behind Eydis as they walked off the large property."
0,"Eydis left Rynn behind in the bedroom with a warning to the humans that if any of them so much as looked at her, she would slaughter them all."
0,The dwarf’s assurance that he had no interest in children only slightly eased her worry.
0,She gave Rynn a knife from the kitchen to defend herself in an emergency because she did not think the girl knew offensive magic.
0,Eydis did not even know if Rynn could use magic.
0,"Being a Forest Elf, she should at least have an affinity to wind or water, maybe earth, but that was far rarer."
0,“Anything important I should know?” Austin called from five full paces behind Eydis.
0,“Nothing.
0,They are useless.
0,We will work without them.
0,Anything I need to know about this world I can hear from you.”
0,"After an hour of walking, Eydis and Austin arrived at the edge of the city proper."
0,Eydis breathed heavy due to the thin air and had to take a break.
0,She pulled Austin away from the road and asked him to fill her in on everything he knew about her sister.
0,“Not much to be honest.
0,She is living with a man who is awfully controlling of her.
0,"She has another friend, Sammy, who she frequently hangs out with."
0,I know Sammy and should be able to find her again if we go to the university.
0,"We can find your sister that way, or--”"
0,"Eydis sensed that everything Austin said was true, at least to his knowledge, so that was enough."
0,“You said you can find her friend at this university place?
0,"Go there, and say nothing of me to anyone."
0,I will search the city.
0,We will meet back here before sunset.
0,Do you have access to the bus?”
0,“That bus pass you have was mine from back when they first took me from Gullivan.” 
0,Eydis returned Austin his bus pass.
0,"Austin was relieved that he would not have to stay with Eydis the entire time, and Eydis was just as relieved to be rid of him."
0,"At the nearest bus stop, he happily boarded the first bus that arrived after Eydis confirmed one last time he had no more deshalu on him."
0,Eydis worried that Austin might run but thought better of it.
0,He would not abandon the slaves Jethro provided for him.
0,And the deshalu; all Austin’s favorite vices were on Whinhlem.
1,Eydis wanted a better look at the city now that she was alone but noticed many people casting strange looks her direction.
0,“Mommy!
0,"It’s an elf!” A mother pulled her daughter along, and the young child’s inquisitive eyes stared at Eydis’s ears."
0,These humans knew about elves.
0,"The documents stated that only humans lived in this city, but perhaps elves existed elsewhere in the world."
0,Or maybe they were rare?
0,"The reports lacked any explanation of how the populace treated foreign races, and her ears were a banner announcing her as an outsider."
0,There was even a possibility that the man with whom the princess was staying hid her race and identity.
0,"If humans of this world were anything like those in hers, walking alone on the streets was dangerous for an elf."
0,"While Eydis feared nothing from weak humans, attracting unneeded attention, especially hostility, was a problem."
0,Eydis walked between two buildings into a secluded alleyway.
0,"She lacked the means to hide her ears, so she chose instead to avoid people where possible."
0,"This also meant she could not use the public transportation of this world, especially in the busier inner city, but she never planned on using it anyway."
0,"Eydis looked up at the tops of the two-story, red-brick buildings sandwiching the alleyway and gauged the distance to the roof."
0,Lurr are far stronger than elves.
0,This should be possible.
0,Eydis crouched down.
0,"Looking at the edge of the roof, she jumped."
0,Biting cold struck her face in her upward climb.
0,"She overestimated her strength, but something else felt off."
0,"Once she reached the apex of her jump, about the height of a third floor had there been one, her descent felt slow."
0,She did not accelerate as fast as she felt she should.
0,She was much lighter in this world than in Whinhlem.
0,The sensation was bizarre and unnerving.
0,Eydis landed on the flat roof with little impact.
0,Most the buildings near her had one or two floors.
0,There were no nearby towers she could use as a vantage point.
0,A city without walls or towers.
0,Was this world a peaceful place that had no need of such things?
0,Or were these humans so powerful that they feared nothing?
1,Eydis ran and jumped to the next building.
0,"When she landed, her pants slipped down."
0,She grabbed them and quickly pulled them back up.
0,"Her loose pants drastically hindered her movement, but she had no means to fasten them."
0,She searched the roof and found a thin wire connected to what looked like a metal sculpture that poorly resembled a tree or perhaps a feather.
0,"She tore up the wire that attached to the base of the sculpture like a root, wrapped it around her hands, and with a swift tug snapped it with a pop."
0,She uprooted more of it along the roof until she felt it was long enough to tie a knot and broke it from the rest of the wire with another swift tug.
0,She slipped the wire a few times through two loops on the waistline of the side of her pants.
0,"After tying a knot that pulled the loops as close together as they could reach, the pants hugged snugly against her waist."
0,"Perhaps this was the purpose of the loops, although she had never seen Austin use them this way, but Austin’s pants fit him perfectly without ties."
0,Eydis ran and jumped to the next building.
0,"Using the rooftops, she avoided the streets until she reached a wide road she would have to cross on the ground."
0,Her breath shot out in heavy white puffs from her lung’s fight for air.
0,"The lightness of her body meant that she was not even the slightest bit exhausted from jumping across the buildings, but the air was far too thin."
0,"Her already light head felt like it was drifting away in the wind, so she sat down and took the opportunity to inspect what she could see of the city."
0,"In the distance, there were larger buildings of multiple floors, but reaching them would be difficult without drawing attention either on the ground or jumping along the rooftops."
0,"A tree-lined river bisected the city, dividing the larger buildings on the far side from the smaller homes and businesses on this side."
0,Eydis understood why finding the princess would be so difficult in such a place.
0,The city was twice the size of Amel.
0,Capturing Austin who had met the princess was quite the stroke of luck.
0,Jethro had found the link to the princess without even knowing.
0,Eydis laughed to herself.
0,His ignorance was her blessing.
0,"The dwarf warned Eydis not to use her spatial magic, but seeing the size of the city, she felt she could risk it."
0,The chances of the princess being close enough to her at this moment to sense her spatial magic were low.
0,The chances the princess would be near her destination would be even less.
0,Very few people were sensitive enough to detect magic from a great distance.
0,"Eydis did not have that ability, and although she was not yet a perfect duplicate of the princess, she doubted the princess was highly sensitive either."
0,Eydis worked out the formula to Jethro’s complicated but lower-cost transmission spell.
0,"She was still unfamiliar with it, so this took time, but Eydis’s inability to regenerate ven naturally meant she had to reserve ven as much as possible."
0,"She had Rynn, but Rynn’s ven regeneration rate was slow, and Eydis felt bad using her for that reason even though Rynn was willing."
0,"Transmission used a quarter the cost of regular teleportation, which made it indisputably beneficial for her, but when thinking over the formula, she felt there was an excessive amount of meaningless bloat that increased the ven cost, and she did not know enough about spatial magic to determine if the excess was needed."
1,"Eydis disappeared with a loud crack, and with a flash of light, strong wind blew in her face."
0,The view from the tallest building of the city was grand.
0,Flat fields surrounded the city on three sides with hills or mountains far in the distance.
0,"Many of the fields had single residences for the landowners, just like the house Jethro’s men occupied."
0,The fields on the final side of the city ran up along a hill that quickly grew into mountains.
0,"A large highway left the city in three directions, one of which led up the hills and into a valley between the mountains."
0,"As far as Eydis could see, the highways did not immediately connect to another city or village."
0,This city was isolated.
0,Perhaps it was a sovereignty of its own.
0,"Her ven was limited, so she could not teleport around the city."
0,"By her estimates, holding Rynn throughout the night would only recover enough ven for three uses."
0,"To prevent a net negative, Eydis figured she could only check one section of the city each day."
0,She began to wish she brought her slave along with Rynn.
0,"The High Elf’s ven regeneration was about five times Rynn’s, but there was nothing she could do about that now."
0,The question then became where to start her search.
0,"Far to the southwest bordering a light forest, many of the structures appeared older or slightly dilapidated, but she could not see perfectly from her distance."
0,"If the buildings were older, finding one unused was possible."
0,Starting her search there was as good of a location as any.
0,Eydis worked out a transmission formula while shivering in the frigid wind.
1,"She appeared in a small, wooded grove near an old residential district on the southwest edge of the city."
0,No one walked the streets in the snow.
0,"None of the automated metal carriages traveled the roads, and only a few wheel tracks drew lines in the wet powder."
0,"Although the houses looked old and the neighborhood abandoned or at least scarcely populated compared to the rest of the city, there was plenty of life within the structures."
0,"Her sensitive ears picked up light conversations, arguments, and people making noise while going about their daily lives."
0,Eydis gritted her teeth in frustration.
0,"This was only the poor district, and she wasted precious ven to teleport here."
0,Eydis wondered if finding an abandoned house was not possible in such a populated city.
0,"To not waste the ven she expended, Eydis continued walking alongside the road inspecting every house from a distance, listening to every minute noise, and peering into every window where possible with the hope that fate might shine on her and provide her what she was searching for."
0,"The sun moved fast in the sky, and Eydis knew that the day would soon be spent."
0,"She read in the reports that days were far shorter in this world, but experiencing it herself felt surreal."
0,"She was about to head back to meet Austin when a small, isolated home at the dead end of a street caught her eye."
0,"It was on the edge of the residential district, and a large, wooded land sat at its back."
0,"Unlike many of the other houses, this one appeared unkempt."
0,"Some form of dead ivy grew up the walls in various places, and the shrubs surrounding the back perimeter of the small property stood tall and overgrown."
0,Eydis walked through the untouched snow of the yard and peered between the auburn curtains of the front window.
0,"She saw and heard no one, but the furniture and décor gave the house a pulse."
0,"It was lived in, but there were no tracks in the snow leading to or from the door."
0,Either the owner was traveling or never left.
0,"Deciding to take the risk, Eydis walked to the front step and tried the door handle."
0,It was unlocked.
1,The inside of the house was dusty and not all too dissimilar from the house that Jethro’s men had secured.
0,"Many absurdly realistic paintings of people lined the walls of the entryway, and small decorations and trinkets sat on every shelf, table, and mantle of the living space."
0,Whoever owned the home had lived here for a time and had gathered many relics in their long life.
0,"“Ara, who is this?”"
0,A sudden hoarse voice called from down the hallway.
0,"Like a specter, a short and smiling elderly lady hobbled over to Eydis."
0,Her light feet moved in perfect silence over the thick carpeted floor.
0,She had wispy hair that had thinned enough to show her scalp.
0,Brown patches peppered her wrinkled skin.
0,The sunken eyes on her heavily creased face smiled through the thin slits of her eyelids.
0,"This woman looked to Eydis to be seven years old if not older, quite a ripe age for a human."
0,"“My, you are beautiful."
0,It’s so nice having visitors.
0,Make yourself at home.
0,I’ll make something warm.” The elderly lady weaved past Eydis to the range and put on a kettle of water with shaking hands.
0,"“Go on, dear."
0,Take a seat.”
0,“I apologize for entering.
0,I will leave.”
0,"“No, no."
0,I do not care if you came here to steal something or for any other reason.
0,"Your eyes show desperation, not malice."
0,You are my guest now.
0,Stay a while.
0,I never get visitors.” The lady flashed a toothy smile that had a gap in the top row just off from the center.
0,“Never?” Eydis sat on the cushion of a threadbare chair in the living room.
0,“How long ago was your last visitor?”
0,"“Oh, two years ago just after my husband died."
0,God bless him.”
0,“How do you live?
0,Do you have family to watch over you?” Eydis thought it impossible for such a feeble old woman to survive on her own for such a length of time.
0,"In the empire, she would be in the care of the community."
0,Humans were truly despicable if they left their elderly to survive their withered years alone.
0,"“Oh, I never had children."
0,"My late husband was infertile, you see."
0,"If it’s food, I can call the market, and they deliver it to my door."
0,"I still have money from my husband, so you don’t have to worry about me.”"
0,A high-pitched squeal spat from the kettle.
0,The lady poured two pristine porcelain cups with shaking hands and mixed a spoonful of brown powder into both.
0,She walked the cups over and handed one to Eydis.
0,"After taking a seat on the couch across from her, she took a sip."
0,The sweet fumes of the cup wafted into Eydis’s face.
0,A cup filled with blood flashed in Eydis’s eyes and the pungent memory assaulted her nose.
0,Her hands shook.
0,The cup fell to the floor and shattered before she realized what happened.
0,“I…” Eydis stared at the ruined drink.
0,“Do not worry yourself.” 
0,The lady sat her cup down beside a lamp on the side table and struggled to her feet.
0,She returned to the kettle to pour another.
0,Eydis accepted it with a bowed head and handed the lady the shards of porcelain.
0,The lady walked with the shards back to the couch and set them aside.
0,She did not seem to mind the broken cup or the brown stain on her carpet.
0,"“Do you want to talk about what is troubling you, dear?”"
0,“I am not troubled.” 
0,"“Your eyes betray you, sweetie."
0,My husband was in the service for most his young life.
0,"He always tried to hide from me the darkness that chased him, but eyes show everything."
0,The pain I saw in your eyes when you looked at the cup was the same.
0,"Please, talk to me."
0,"I cannot offer much, but my ears work well.”"
0,Eydis sat silent looking at the brown liquid in her cup.
0,She smelled it once more to erase the pungent memory of blood clogging her nose.
0,"Her hands shook, but she forced a sip, half expecting the brown liquid to be bitter like the beverage Jethro offered."
0,It had a smooth and sweet texture unlike anything she had ever tasted.
0,Shivers ran down her spine and a smile grew on her face.
0,"Unknown to her, her feet tapped lightly on the carpet."
0,“What is this?”
0,“You have never had hot chocolate before?
0,Poor thing.
0,Drink as much as you like.”
0,"Eydis downed her cup, and the lady refilled it."
0,"She was about to take a sip out of courtesy but stopped and moved the cup away, subconsciously thinking for a moment that there would be blood in it this time like there had been once before."
0,"Eydis could not stop the shaking of her hands, so she set the cup down on the mantelshelf beside her before she dropped it again."
0,"“Don’t force it, dear."
0,What happened?”
0,Eydis bit the inside of her cheek.
0,"“He is in my head, and I cannot remove him.”"
0,“Who?
0,A father?
0,Brother?
0,Husband or boyfriend?”
0,“An enemy.
0,He imprisoned me.” Eydis’s eyes shifted to the cup beside her.
0,“He made me fight for his amusement.
0,"When I tried to fight back, he almost killed me."
0,He forced me to work with a man who thinks of nothing but assaulting women and children…”
0,Eydis’s words caught in her mouth.
0,Her face contorted in anger and disgust.
0,“Children!
0,Jethro did nothing to help her!” 
0,"Eydis’s fists balled tight and quivered with the thoughts of all that her people had suffered at the hands of the soldiers, all that Symra, Dyas, Wian, Jil, and Rynn had suffered."
0,If Eydis had not been there to take Rynn away…
0,"Eydis’s hands clenched so tight her nails pierced the skin of her palms, dripping blood onto the floor."
0,The elderly woman looked upon Eydis with watering eyes.
0,"Her mouth quivered, unable to speak."
0,She knelt in front of Eydis in the wet of the spilled drink and clasped her hands gently over Eydis’s.
0,"“I’m… I’m so, so sorry."
0,I’m so sorry…” The elderly lady’s tears fell on Eydis’s hands.
0,“You have been through hell as great as any war.
0,What of that man?
0,Have the police found him?
0,Are you free of him?”
0,"“No, not yet, but I will be."
0,I will make him pay for all he has done.” Eydis clasped the lady’s hands and looked into her eyes.
0,“I took the girl away.
0,We need somewhere to hide.
0,"We need somewhere no one will find us, where no one will visit."
0,"No one can know where we are, not him, not even the people of this city.”"
0,The lady brought Eydis’s hands to her cheek and rested it against them.
0,“You can stay here.
0,No one will find you.
0,You will be safe.
0,"Please, let me help you.”"
0,"The woman’s voice resonated with an honest, eager truth."
0,Life magic channeled through Eydis’s hands into the soft grasp of the elderly woman.
0,"She convulsed once, twice, and then fell to the floor with blank eyes."
0,Eydis breathed heavy.
0,Her heart thundered with an empty and painful pulse as she looked down at the body of the woman who sympathized with her and offered help.
0,"She knew she betrayed that kindness, but Rynn was not human."
0,"Even though the woman’s offer of help was genuine, there was no way of knowing how this woman would react to seeing Rynn, and she could not risk anyone knowing about her or her situation."
0,"Eydis closed the lady’s eyes, placed her hand on the woman’s forehead, and recited simple words of parting."
0,“May you find rest with your husband.
0,Thank you for your help.” 
0,"Her words did not remove the ache, so she pushed it to the back of her mind."
0,"Eydis picked up the cup she set down and tried to take another drink, but her hands resisted bringing the cup near her lips."
0,“I am not his to control.”
0,"Not wanting to be defeated by Jethro, she forced the sweet liquid into her mouth and set the cup on the table."
1,"Aside from the living and the dining room, there were only three other rooms in the small house."
0,"The largest was a bed chamber containing less furniture than the house Jethro’s men occupied: only a bed, dresser, and small bedside table."
0,She searched the room and found nothing more than clothing and accessories.
0,The room’s closet contained several dresses and other clothing that might fit Rynn.
0,"The next room contained a tub, wash basin, mirror, and a strange looking white seat."
0,The seat had a metal handle on it that when raised or lowered flushed water and refilled the bowl.
0,"The lingering odor suggested it was a self-rinsing chamber pot, or so she assumed."
0,"She could think of no other purpose for it in the small washroom, and no chamber pot was found in the other room."
0,Eydis had to wonder why no one in the palace had thought of such a mechanism.
0,One last door stood at the end of the hallway.
0,"Given the orientations of the rooms and the size of the house, there was not enough space for another room."
0,"Opening the door revealed a closet of hanging coats and a few boxes, but to the side a second door led to a downward stairway."
0,"From the dark, Eydis could hear a faint humming."
0,She walked down but could not see any source of light nor did she have any means to produce light herself.
0,"She could see in the dark to some extent with her Lurr eyes, but the darkness was still inconvenient, so she turned back to look in the other rooms for anything that could help."
0,"On the way back up the dark steps, Eydis ran her hand along the wall to keep her orientation when her hand slid across a tiny lever."
0,"The lever flipped upwards, and a dull yellow light illuminated the room."
0,“Some kind of cellar?
0,Perfect.”
0,"Dust covered the stone floor, and jars of preserved food, tools, or miscellaneous old items lined the shelves, most of which Eydis could not even hope to identify."
0,A small black tank with a pipe leading to the ceiling nestled into the corner.
0,"Wood piled next to it suggested it was used to burn fuel, but it appeared seldom used."
0,"Just like the flushing chamber pot, this might also be deceptively similar to something Eydis knew."
0,"A fireplace under the home made little sense, but if its purpose was heat, perhaps it acted as the heat source to the home’s hypocaust, not unlike the large furnaces that heated the bottom floors of the palace."
0,"It was compact and finely crafted, but it was a furnace all the same."
0,Eydis realized that the house had adequate heat despite having no fire in the furnace.
0,"The owner must have had other means to heat the home, but the cellar remained rather cold, being underground."
0,"She would need to either find the means to heat the cellar or get the furnace in working order again, something she had no experience in, but she was confident she could figure it out."
0,She had no servants or slaves in this world.
0,She needed to learn everything herself.
0,"Having inspected the cellar, Eydis turned towards the stairs."
0,"Underneath she noticed a pale green chest, the source of the humming."
0,"When she released the latch, mist escaped, and cold air caressed Eydis’s face."
0,Frost caked the sides of the chest.
0,It was almost empty except for what looked like a few bundles of wrapped meat.
0,"From the moment she first stepped into this world, to viewing the city, to the strange lighting on the ceiling, and now seeing a chest that freezes its contents, she could not deny that the humans of this world had magic, despite what the reports said."
0,Jethro was far less informed than he thought.
0,"Eydis had no use for meat storage, but this frozen chest could serve a better purpose."
0,She ran upstairs and lifted the old lady over her shoulder.
0,She considered teleporting her far from the city or into the river at the outer border but was unsure how traveled the river was or where people did or did not go outside the city.
0,"If they discovered the body, they might link her to this house, and Eydis would no longer be able to use it."
0,Eydis found the frozen chest a blessing.
0,There the body could be hidden and would not decay.
0,She placed the lady inside and sealed the latch.
0,"All Eydis needed was one more item to complete her preparations in the event that the princess was uncooperative, and Jethro’s men would likely be in possession of it."
0,"If not, she would have to search the city or find another equivalent."
0,Eydis returned to the lounge and saw the black sky through the window.
0,The day moved far too fast.
0,"If Jethro’s men were to trust her, she needed to obey their curfew."
1,"She worked out the formula, and with a loud crack, Eydis appeared on the roof of the building she had first jumped onto."
0,She hopped down into the alley and walked past the people searching with wobbling heads for the origin of the flash of light.
0,Austin waited at their arranged location brimming with confidence.
1,"* * *
Early the next morning before sunup, Austin took Eydis to the river."
0,They crouched down in the bushes to watch the opposite side.
0,"Austin could barely see, but Eydis could pick out details on the other side of the river in the dim ambient light from the city."
0,"After waiting for a half hour, a gate on the far side opened, and two figures walked onto the path."
0,A woman with long golden hair walked beside a shorter man.
0,"Their conversation was quiet, but occasionally a small laugh came from the woman."
0,"Before they walked too far for Eydis to see them well, she saw the woman grasp the man’s hand and draw closer."
0,"“That was your sister, right?”"
0,"Eydis continued staring, ignoring the whisper from Austin."
0,"There was a pull, a feeling unlike anything Eydis had ever felt before, one that forced her eyes to follow."
0,"If she was not making an active effort to stay hidden, Eydis knew that she would subconsciously follow them, stalk them, hunt them like a predator hunting her prey."
0,"In the dark, that woman could have easily been any tall woman with blond hair, but Eydis knew."
0,There was no doubt in her mind.
0,"Something inside her that Eydis could not explain told her that this was the princess, Eydis FeAmel."
0,She turned to Austin and grabbed the front of his coat.
0,“Where are they going?”
0,“To the university.
0,"The guy she is with, Justin, has morning classes today."
0,She follows him everywhere.”
0,Eydis gawked at Austin in disbelief.
0,"She thought he only knew rumors or secondhand information, maybe from the princess’s acquaintance he knew."
0,"She thought him wholly incompetent, but his ability to gather information was startling."
0,“How did you learn this much in one day?” Eydis asked.
0,“I knew where she lived before I was taken to your world.
0,I… sort of followed her around for a while.
0,Yesterday I just checked if she was still with him and if they still lived here.”
0,If Jethro knew who he had!
0,Eydis screamed in her mind.
0,"“Give me one of those food bars,” she ordered."
0,"Austen removed a small, wrapped energy bar from his bag and handed it to Eydis."
0,“This will last me for the day.
0,I will watch from the top of the buildings.
0,You go to the university and find what she does there.
0,We must find a time she is alone.
0,No one else can know I am here.
0,And do not tell her of me.
0,Understand?”
0,“Why not just go to her?” 
0,Eydis pulled Austin closer.
0,"“Understand?” Meeting the princess personally and explaining the situation was certainly an option and one that she was not completely opposed to, but this world was still foreign."
0,"She had to be sure of what kind of situation the princess was in first, both for her own safety and especially for Rynn."
0,She could not tell how long that house in the poor district would remain safe.
0,She may eventually have to introduce Rynn to the princess’s associates.
0,Doing so without proper investigation first was foolishness.
0,They also needed to find a time when the princess was alone.
0,"Whether she makes the final decision to replace the princess or join her, the initial encounter could not involve anyone other than the princess."
0,Austin’s frightful nod sufficed Eydis’s demand for secrecy.
0,"After checking that the princess was out of sight and far enough away that she would not detect the use of spatial magic, Eydis disappeared with a loud crack that startled Austin, making him trip backwards."
1,Eydis appeared on the tallest building in the city.
0,The frozen morning wind stabbed her deep through her coat.
0,She shivered uncontrollably while locating the university from the dwarf’s explanation of the city’s layout and then formulated another transmission spell.
0,The transmission landed her on the tallest building on the campus.
0,She searched the surrounding roads for the markings of a stopping point for the transportation machine called a bus.
0,Eydis frowned.
0,“I should have asked Austin at which terminal this bus would stop.”
0,There were three bus stops in view from the top of the building.
0,Eydis resigned herself to let fate decide if she would see them exit the bus and prayed that in the time she took to create the transmission formula to the campus she had not missed them.
0,The same strange pull Eydis felt at the river guided her eyes to one of the bus stops.
0,There she spotted a familiar golden-haired woman step off the bus behind the man she accompanied.
0,The two no longer held hands.
0,The princess walked beside him with a dignified air.
0,"A few of the humans who also arrived early waved to the princess, and the princess greeted them back in turn."
0,"She seemed rather acquainted with, if not popular among, those at the university."
0,“Perhaps finding a human who knew the princess was easier than I thought.”
0,Or perhaps she only knew those who arrived with her in the early hours of the morning.
0,Austin was clearly not the only one who knew her.
0,"Whatever the case, Eydis found it odd that Jethro’s men had not located her yet."
0,How incompetent were they?
0,The princess and the man continued along the campus path until they entered one of the structures.
0,"Even though Eydis could no longer see the princess, because she had noticed her, she felt the princess’s location as if her very soul was drawn to her."
0,She could feel the moment before the princess exited the structure.
0,"Her body recognized her prey and would not let it escape, and that feeling was terrifying."
0,"Such heightened perception was not natural, but when Eydis remembered that she was not a High Elf but a monster called a Lurr, her surprise became disgust."
0,"It wasn’t natural--nothing about it was--and it churned her stomach, but she understood that she had little choice but to abuse these bestial impulses to track her prey."
0,The pair walked to the other side of the campus and entered another building.
0,"Again Eydis waited, and again she knew when they would exit."
1,The sun rose high in the midday sky.
0,The couple meandered around the campus cheerfully talking and greeting others.
0,"One orange-haired woman they greeted ran over, talked with them for a long while, and then remained with them as they walked."
0,It was then that Austin approached the group.
0,He ignored the princess completely and addressed the orange-haired woman.
0,"The more he talked, the more the woman denied his advances until displeasure grew on both the princess’s and the man’s faces."
0,The woman’s face grew so red that Eydis could see clearly the change in color even from her distance.
0,She latched herself onto the man’s arm and shouted something back at Austin.
0,"Austin shook his head and pointed at the princess and then her partner, denying whatever she said."
0,"The princess stood in front of Austin, blocking him from pressuring her further."
0,Austin left after a few pushes from the princess.
0,"This man, Justin, had another woman besides the princess."
0,"From the way the princess interacted with the man, Eydis was sure they were intimate and perhaps lovers."
0,The realization that Justin had the princess but still decided on having a second woman caused disgust to worm around in the pit of Eydis’s stomach.
0,Was a princess not good enough for him?
0,Was the princess content with this?
0,The princess talked to the woman to calm her down.
0,Her gesticulation suggested that she thought the woman could have fought him off.
0,"Giving up on her lecture, the princess led Justin and the woman to the bus stop, and they left campus together."
0,"Once Eydis could no longer feel the princess’s presence, she teleported to the river thinking that they would return to their home; however, the princes and her man did not appear until evening right before Eydis had to leave to meet Austin."
0,The orange-haired woman was not with them.
1,"* * *
The next day, the princess did not leave with Justin until later that morning."
0,"They rode the bus to the campus as usual, but when they arrived, they met up with a rather short, brown haired woman who could have passed as a dwarf if she had a thicker build, perhaps half-dwarf."
0,The man left the princess in her care and entered the largest building on campus.
0,The new woman and the princess talked happily as they disappeared inside a different building.
0,The princess stayed with this woman long past noon until Justin returned.
0,"The woman then parted ways, and the princess remained with Justin for the afternoon."
0,Meet.
0,Handoff.
0,Meet.
0,Handoff.
0,"The boredom of Eydis’s observations grew unbearable, but she had nothing else to occupy herself aside from fighting back the incessant urge to attack the princess."
0,This was nothing more than self-inflicted psychological torture.
0,She wondered if cooperating with the princess was even possible with such urges.
0,"She had to resist, but she couldn’t look away."
0,She did not want to miss any part of the princess’s routine.
0,She needed to find an opening.
0,"There had to be one, but after the tenth time swallowing the hungry saliva pooling in her mouth, Eydis wondered how long she could keep this up before the bestial urges won over."
0,I am not a monster!
0,"Eydis reminded herself that she was not the Alukah, a beast that acted on pure instinct."
0,"She was an elf, a person with thoughts of her own and control over her actions and emotions."
0,I am not a monster.
1,Little daylight remained.
0,The couple walked to the far side of campus out of eyesight of Eydis.
0,"She did not want to lose them, and so she risked teleporting to another building that would give her a better vantage, trusting that the distance would still be far enough from the princess to prevent her from noticing the use of spatial magic."
0,"The unnerving, soul-rooted pull immediately helped Eydis find her prey."
0,"The princess continued talking happily with Justin, this time holding his hand and carrying some sort of beverage in the other."
0,"Thankfully, the princess had not noticed the spatial magic or the flash of light that transmission produced upon arrival."
0,The princess and her man entered a spacious building and remained inside past sundown.
0,"Eydis had to return, but she wanted to see when they would leave."
0,“The curfew is a baseless restriction.
0,"What if the princess only left outside at night because she was in hiding?” Eydis continued talking to herself, staving her boredom and distracting herself from her predatory hunger."
0,She needed a valid excuse for her tardiness that did not involve informing the dwarf captain that she had found the princess.
0,"Feeling the pull, Eydis’s eyes focused on the large glass doors of the building."
0,The princess appeared with Justin but was also accompanied by three other women.
0,The short one from earlier that day walked on the left side of Justin.
0,Between her and Justin was a new woman with short brown hair.
0,Her arms wrapped around Justin and the short woman’s shoulders.
0,"The princess stood smiling next to Justin on his right with the former orange-hair beside her on her left, her hands clasped firmly in theirs."
0,Such physical association only happened between intimate partners.
0,It would be uncouth to appear as such in public otherwise.
0,Eydis’s hands gripped the masonry of the building tighter and tighter until it cracked.
0,Her heart thundered hard enough that it pulsed in her ears.
0,The bestial urges were not at fault this time.
0,An even stronger sense of disgust overpowered them as she watched the laughing group walk through the frigid night.
0,“I am going to join the princess in such a situation?” Eydis’s teeth ground together in her anger.
0,"Or worse, replace her, she thought."
0,This man is no better than Austin!
0,"Now that she had a chance at freedom by replacing the true princess in this new world, she would only become one woman among many for some human male with no attractive qualities, with no combat physique, and who lived in a poor tenement by the river."
0,"And the princess was living happily, somehow completely accepting of being some add-on for this man and in complete ignorant bliss of everything that was happening in Whinhlem, to the Amelian Empire, to her people, and especially to those who were being preyed upon by the wretched human soldiers."
0,"Eydis fought back the cry of fury that bubbled up in her throat, choosing instead to watch the small group with her burning crimson eyes."
1,"Over the next six days, Eydis continued to observe the princess from afar while constantly fighting back her anger at the princess’s carefree life and suppressing the urges of her Lurr nature."
0,Austin tailed them close to discover the specific details of their methodic routine.
0,"They needed an opening where the princess was alone, and Austin found one."
0,"Chapter 20
“Tears”
Eydis"
1,"“Seriously, that bitch,” Austin groaned again."
0,He was spotted leaving a room restricted to women and was slapped for his efforts.
0,Proper treatment for a lecher.
0,Eydis walked a few paces in front of Austin on the roadside.
0,"The sun had set, and the dark road was only lit by the lights of the city behind it and the few vehicles that passed."
0,"Austin’s hands shook, and he constantly rubbed his arms."
0,"He was clearly going through withdrawals, but surprisingly he endured them well by appearance."
0,Personality was another matter.
0,“This is the fourth time I have been hit for helping you save your sister.
0,Women never treated me like this before.
0,I am tired of being here.
0,The women of your world are much kinder.”
0,Eydis’s hands balled to a fist.
0,She wanted to punch Austin with her full Lurr strength.
0,"The entire trek back, she had been trying to avoid speaking to him, but she could no longer stay silent in the face of Austin’s willful ignorance."
0,“Those women do not have a choice.
0,They are slaves!”
0,“That’s not true.
0,"They can use magic, right?"
0,"I’m sure the freckled one, Symra, can fight."
0,She has a really toned body with a lot of muscle.
0,"She has chiseled abs, a ton of endurance, and damn can she clamp down…”"
0,Eydis could almost feel the slimy grin across his face.
0,"“If they wanted me to stop, they could make me, but they say they like it."
0,Dyas even uses magic to make me last longer.
0,Quite the nympho.”
0,Eydis reached back and grabbed the front of Austin’s coat.
0,"Her eyes burned red, glowing faintly in the dark."
0,“You think they like being attacked by a worthless animal?
0,Do you even know why they became slaves?”
0,Austin stared back without fear in his eyes.
0,“Because they lost the war?”
0,“They gave their bodies to protect their families.
0,"They are scared that if they hurt you, hurt any human, if they do not do what you ask, if they do not do what you want, say what you want to hear, you will tell the soldiers to kill those they love.”"
0,Austin’s eyes grew wide.
0,“That’s… I wouldn’t…”
0,A weak lie hidden behind nervous hesitation.
0,“You would not do that?
0,After how much you beat Wian?” Eydis tossed Austin into the gravel on the side of the road.
0,“Do not lie!
0,You know they can do nothing against you!
0,You are no different than the humans that kill my people!”
0,"Eydis endured Austin’s presence only long enough to create a transmission formula and teleport away, leaving Austin behind on the roadside."
0,"She was relieved that the impenetrable watch of the princess’s associates had a hole, but this did not change the fact that every day she returned to the base furious because of something Austin said or did."
0,“Austin knows full well that his actions anger me.”
0,This confrontation was only one of many.
0,"The stronger Austin’s withdrawal symptoms showed, the more he pushed Eydis to her emotional limits when she was already mentally and emotionally exhausted from suppressing her anger and enduring her urges while observing the princess."
0,"She suspected that the withdrawals made him less cautious, but her greater worry was that he knew she needed his help, and if she hurt him, her progress would slow drastically."
0,He clung onto the only weak form of control he had over her.
0,His withdrawals were simply emboldening him.
0,"It was almost as if he exploited her restraint to get revenge for forcing him to do everything she wanted, possibly because she saved Rynn from him."
0,"Whether this was his true motive or not, Eydis did not know, and she did not care."
0,Something needed to be done.
0,“He is growing too dangerous.”
0,"The worse Austin became, the less she could trust him to do his part and not reveal her hidden actions."
1,"Eydis opened the door of the house and found the dead body of a middle-aged, balding man in the hallway."
0,Another had the ill fortune of visiting.
0,"No vehicle was parked in front of the house, so one of Jethro’s men must have driven it to abandon at some far away location as they had the others."
0,Eydis stepped over the body and continued to the hallway.
0,Jethro’s men would eventually dispose of the body as well.
0,"When Eydis found out that they had the means to hide bodies, she considered bringing over the frozen corpse of the elderly woman she kept in the cellar, but then questions would arise about where the woman came from and why she was frozen, and Eydis did not want to deal with the trouble."
0,"In the kitchen, only the dwarf was present."
0,He watched Eydis with some form of meat in his hand.
0,His gaze lacked his usual impartial stare.
0,There was a hint of distrust in his eyes.
0,“I thought I told you not to use spatial magic.”
0,Eydis acted as if she did not notice him and continued down the hall.
1,"At the end, the door to the bedroom was closed and locked."
0,Eydis knocked.
0,“Rynn?
0,I have returned.”
0,Quiet footsteps walked to the door and unlatched it.
0,Rynn opened the door with faint relief.
0,"This surprised Eydis, because Rynn never showed any emotion."
0,The girl wrapped her arms around Eydis’s waist and buried her face in Eydis’s stomach.
0,“I am sorry that I have been gone later and later.”
0,Eydis looked back down the hall.
0,"Seeing that the dwarf had not followed to continue his rebuke, she walked Rynn inside the room and closed the door behind her."
0,“I am almost done.
0,I will take you away from here soon.
0,Did the humans give you any trouble?”
0,Rynn looked down at the floor.
0,"She did not deny the question, which worried Eydis."
0,Eydis dropped down to her knees to look into Rynn’s shifting eyes.
0,“You do not belong to the humans any longer.
0,You can speak against them.”
0,Rynn hesitated but turned her back to Eydis and pulled on a tear on the back seem of her dress.
0,“Who?
0,Who touched you?”
0,Rynn lifted her hand high above her head.
0,“The giant?”
0,Rynn nodded.
1,Eydis flung open the door and ran into the kitchen.
0,She grabbed the dwarf by his shirt and thrust him against the cupboards.
0,The wooden doors cracked and then buckled inward under the force.
0,“I warned you and your men not to touch Rynn!” Eydis’s eyes flared.
0,"The dwarf was not alarmed, nor did he react to the pain of the impact."
0,“You see that my men are gone.
0,I sent them away because I overheard them talking about how to take the girl from you.
0,Be assured that nothing happened to her.
0,Leaving her here alone with soldiers who are starved for a woman’s comfort is foolishness.
0,I am sure you realize this.”
0,Eydis dropped the dwarf on the floor.
0,His words skillfully defused her anger.
0,He threw the responsibility for Rynn’s safety back at her.
0,She understood the dangers and still chose to bring Rynn against Jethro’s wishes.
0,“What else can I do?
0,"I could not leave her behind in Whinhlem without my protection, and I cannot take her with while running all over the city."
0,"I look enough like you humans, but she is different.”"
0,The dwarf picked himself up off the floor and sat back at the table to continue his meal.
0,"“If you have somewhere else you could take her, I suggest you do so.”"
0,Something was off in how the dwarf spoke.
0,His words were not suggestive.
0,It was an accusation.
0,Did he know?
0,Eydis had thought of moving Rynn to the house she found but knew it would raise suspicion against her and limit her freedom to make her own plans and preparation.
0,"She also needed Rynn to recover ven overnight, and these humans expected her to be here."
0,She would not have been able to spend each night at that house on the other side of the city.
0,“I know you have found her.”
0,Eydis’s fears had been realized.
0,"She stepped back and was about to deny it, but the dwarf spoke first."
0,"“You have been hiding this from us, and I can only assume that you are planning to take her away and hide her somewhere."
0,"She attends the large school, does she not?”"
0,Eydis’s eyes grew red.
0,Her hands moved unconsciously towards the dwarf.
0,“Killing me will do you no benefit.
0,My men are moving into position.
0,We will secure her when she arrives in the morning.”
0,The morning classes.
0,How much did he know?
0,"Somehow, they were observing Eydis, or perhaps Austin."
0,"Eydis was backed into a corner, but she lacked the means to retaliate."
0,She had little choice but to reveal her hand.
0,Eydis never returned to the house she procured since she left the first day.
0,She was confident that in the least he did not know its location.
0,"So long as that remained a secret, there was little point hiding that she had been monitoring the princess."
0,Her plan might still work.
0,She only needed to convince him not to act without her.
0,“You must call your men back.
0,It is not wise for you to confront her yet.
0,"From what I have seen, the princess is holding combat and magic lessons."
0,We do not know their affinities or how skilled those who follow her are.”
0,“You fear amateurs?” The dwarf cast a distrusting glare.
0,“The princess fought Jethro and survived.
0,She will be difficult enough on her own let alone with others protecting her.”
0,The dwarf’s mustache twitched.
0,"“I realize that you want to take her place as any doppelganger would, but our mission takes priority over whatever precautions you have made to not involve those around her.”"
0,“I am not just referring to my desires.
0,We still do not know what the humans of this world are capable of.
0,You can expect the princess to fight back.
0,Any delay and the humans will come to her aid.
0,She is well known and well liked at that school.
0,We need to isolate her.”
0,The dwarf nodded.
0,“Have you found such an opening?”
0,"“I have, so I beg your restraint."
0,I can send the princess to you.”
0,The dwarf pushed his cleared plate away and turned his chair to face Eydis.
0,“How can I trust that you will not take her away instead of to us?”
0,His question silenced Eydis.
0,She did not know what she could offer.
0,He knew she had been working behind his back and kept all information from him.
0,Her word would not suffice.
0,“How about the spriggan girl?”
0,Eydis grabbed the dwarf and lifted him into the air.
0,Red fury returned to her eyes.
0,"The dwarf, however, did not lose his composure."
0,“Do not mistake my intensions.
0,She will not come to harm.
0,My men will watch her until Princess Eydis is in our custody.
0,We will then release her to you.” A small smile grew below the dwarf’s mustache.
0,"“Or, you could take the spriggan and leave now."
0,We will have the princess tomorrow with or without your help.
0,Your agreement with the Commanding General will be fulfilled.”
0,Conflicting feelings swirled inside Eydis.
0,The dwarf was correct.
0,Jethro tasked her with locating the princess so his men could capture her.
0,"If she let Jethro’s men attack the princess at the school, some of her associates would likely die, and those who survived would know that the princess was taken away."
0,"Eydis would lose her place in the city, but she could find somewhere else in the world to live."
0,"It was a tempting idea, but would other humans be as accepting of her kind as the princess’s friends had?"
0,"She would also forever be an incomplete doppelganger, just a failed copy of the original princess."
0,And Jethro would win.
0,She hated Jethro for everything he put her through and especially for consigning Rynn to slavery.
0,"He alone would be victorious, and Eydis would only obtain a shallow freedom alone with Rynn in an unfamiliar world."
0,Could she place Rynn in further danger for her revenge against Jethro and the hope of a better life for her and Rynn in this world?
0,Eydis sat the dwarf down on the floor.
0,“Let me talk with Rynn.”
0,“Take your time.
0,You have until we strike to make your decision.”
1,"Eydis walked down the hallway, her mind heavy."
0,She entered the room and locked the door behind her.
0,Rynn waited on the bed.
0,She sat next to the girl and pulled her down so that Rynn’s head rested in her lap.
0,Her fingers caressed the girl’s cheek and ran through her hair.
0,"Forest Elf women were short in stature compared to High Elves, and in Eydis’s lap, Rynn truly looked like a child, a child that should be protected from all the evils of the world."
0,Eydis was the one charged with that protection.
0,"Rynn was her responsibility, and yet… "
0,Eydis spoke after a breath that felt like swallowing a hot coal.
0,“Did you hear?”
0,The small head nodded.
0,“We could leave now and live together in this world.
0,"We would be alone, but I would be happy with that so long as I have you.” This was a third option that she had not considered."
0,It was so obvious after the dwarf mentioned it that Eydis had to wonder why the idea never crossed her mind.
0,Rynn pulled Eydis’s hand away and sat up.
0,She looked Eydis in the eyes and shook her head.
0,“You do not want that?”
0,Rynn shook her head again and pointed at Eydis.
0,“Me…?”
0,Eydis gripped the blankets beneath her.
0,She knew what Rynn was saying.
0,"Somehow, the girl understood Eydis’s hidden feelings better than she did."
0,I do not want that…
0,“I am sorry Rynn.
0,I am sorry.
0,"I just, I cannot let him beat me."
0,I cannot just run away.”
0,"And, I cannot ignore the princess, not anymore."
0,"Eydis loathed to admit it, but after her days of monitoring the princess, her Lurr urges continually dominated her thoughts."
0,The only respite she found was in the presence of Rynn who alone seemed to be able to calm the beast inside.
0,Rynn slid behind Eydis.
0,"Two slender arms wrapped around Eydis’s slouched body, and a small head rested on her shoulder blade."
0,"“They already tried to lay their hands on you, and the dwarf stopped them, right?"
0,"He gave me his word that his men will not touch you while I go after the princess, but he will not be there to stop them."
0,I will not be there to stop them.
0,I am putting you in danger.”
0,Rynn tightened her embrace.
0,“I am so sorry…” Tears welled up in Eydis’s eyes.
0,She chose her own revenge over Rynn’s safety.
0,Rynn was completely selfless.
0,She gave of herself without ever thinking of her own wellbeing.
0,She surrendered herself to slavery to protect another from the same terrible fate.
0,"And now, she was willing to place herself in the hands of the humans once more so that Eydis could take the princess away from them."
0,Eydis pulled Rynn around to stand in front of her.
0,"“If you are willing to go this far for my revenge, then I will make certain you have yours."
0,Do you still have your knife?”
0,Rynn pointed to the bedside table.
0,Eydis grabbed the knife and tucked it into the sash on the back of Rynn’s dress.
0,"After thinking of how much time had passed since she arrived at the house, she created a regular teleportation formula and tore open the portal."
0,"With Rynn’s hand clasped in hers, she pulled the girl through."
1,They appeared on the side of the road on the outskirts of the city.
0,Rynn shivered from the frigid evening wind blowing over the fields.
0,Eydis searched down the barren road in both directions looking for her target.
0,Her estimations were not far off.
0,She spotted Austin about half a quarter mile further down walking away from them in the direction of the house.
0,"Eydis followed at a distance while she created two teleportation formulas, one traditional and one transmission."
0,"When finished, she lifted Rynn in her arms and ran after Austin."
0,Austin heard hastened footsteps and turned around.
0,“What are you doing here?” 
0,"He was startled to see Eydis, but his eyes located Rynn in Eydis’s arms."
0,"Eydis set her down, and Rynn quickly hid behind Eydis."
0,"She could not look at Austin, and her grip on Eydis’s hand tightened the longer Austin stared."
0,“Jethro’s men know we found my sister.
0,They will attack her tomorrow.” 
0,Eydis’s announcement immediately returned Austin’s focus.
0,Panic rose.
0,“Then we need to tell her!
0,"You can teleport to her apartment, right?”"
0,“No.
0,"I convinced them to let me meet her alone, so we will follow my plan, but I do not know if I can do a part of it."
0,I have never used Jethro’s magic on another person.
0,You will help me as agreed.”
0,Austin vanished with a loud crack.
0,It seemed transmission could be used on others.
0,Eydis used the second teleportation formula to open a portal and pull Rynn through.
1,They exited in a snow-covered field far from the city.
0,The city glowed in the distance like a glimmering gem.
0,"The only light in the snowy field came from the stars and full moon in the frigid, cloudless sky."
0,"Eydis felt the nighttime scene beautiful, even more so because of the screams of the man beside them serenading the dark."
0,“What… Gah!
0,Why did you…!
0,HaaAAHH!”
0,"Austin’s ankle twisted back, and the calf attached to it bent at a right angle."
0,The other leg fared no better.
0,The knee hyperextended and twisted to the side.
0,Eydis’ transmission teleported him about fifty feet above ground into a freefall.
0,“Why did I hurt you?
0,Do you truly not know?
0,All the more reason to kill you.”
0,The color drained from Austin’s face.
0,“Wait!
0,You said… you said you wouldn’t kill me… if I helped you!”
0,“Do not insult me.
0,I did not lie.
0,I will not kill you.”
0,Eydis walked to the writhing man and stomped down on his left arm just below the shoulder.
0,It buckled inward with a loud pop.
0,Austin cried out.
0,His screams were like the sweet songs of morning birds in Eydis’s ears.
0,"When they died to whimpers, Eydis stomped on his left arm in the same manner to continue the beautiful song."
0,Both arms and legs were broken.
0,Austin writhed on his back but was unable to move away.
0,The pain was so intense that his body entered shock.
0,"He stopped screaming, but Eydis was content with her own retribution."
0,"Austin looked up at her with terrified, bloodshot eyes."
0,“Do not look at me.” 
0,Eydis presented Rynn.
0,Austin stared in horror at the knife in the girl’s hands.
0,“This child will end your life.”
0,“Ch… child? Child…?
0,That’s not… isn’t she older… than me?
0,I didn’t--”
0,“Do not lie!
0,How could you not know this was a child?
0,You had Wian!
0,You knew and still touched her!
0,You still hurt her!”
0,Eydis ran her finger down the blade of the knife in Rynn’s hands.
0,It surged with swirling wind energy.
0,“Now you will pay.”
0,"Rynn looked up at Eydis, and Eydis nodded back."
0,“Wait… Please!
0,I… I didn’t know!”
0,Lies.
0,"Rynn took slow steps over the snow and straddled Austin’s stomach, her face emotionless."
0,There was no joy or anger.
0,"She was like a stone, only doing what she was ordered."
0,“How does it feel?
0,"You are hurt, you cannot move, and now that someone wants to thrust something painful inside you, you cannot run away,” Eydis said with a sneer."
0,Rynn plunged the knife into Austin’s chest.
0,The wind energy coating the blade allowed the knife to cut clean and unobstructed.
0,"Air from the knife bubbled up from the wound, spraying blood into the air."
0,“Keep stabbing him.
0,Make him suffer for what he did.
0,Just avoid anywhere that will be immediately lethal.”
0,Rynn continually drove the knife in over and over again.
0,"When she punctured his lungs, blood and air erupted from his mouth."
0,She stabbed his arms.
0,She turned and stabbed his legs.
0,“You are missing a very important area.”
0,Rynn looked to where Eydis pointed and plunged the knife repeatedly into Austin’s groin.
0,The soft tissue blew apart from the force of the wind.
0,Eydis reached down to touch Austin’s hand and used life magic to keep him conscious and prolong his torment.
0,She then moved behind Rynn so that Rynn could focus solely on the man beneath her.
0,“He is still alive.
0,"Keep stabbing him for every time he touched you, for every time he struck you."
0,For every time he hurt you or Symra or Dyas or Wian.
0,For every person you know and love who you lost.
0,"For everyone who suffered from the violence or lusts of these humans, until you are content.”"
0,Rynn held the knife in one hand and braced the body with the other.
0,Her strikes grew more and more aggressive.
0,She stabbed both shallow and deep in a rapid and haphazard flurry.
0,Fifty strikes grew to one hundred.
0,Eydis could do nothing more to keep Austin alive.
0,"He had long passed, but Rynn showed no signs of stopping."
0,"Two hundred strikes grew to three hundred, and Eydis began to worry."
0,Rynn shook from exhaustion and cold.
0,Each strike fell weaker than the last.
0,Rynn’s breath grew heavy and ragged.
0,"She lifted the knife in her unstable hand to force the blade down as hard as she could, but when the dull knife struck the morbid heap, it failed to penetrate and slipped from her bloody fingers."
0,Eydis grabbed Rynn’s wrist and turned her around.
0,"Tears ran down the young spriggan’s blood-splattered cheeks, yet she did not blink."
0,“That is enough.
0,He is dead.”
0,“B…but… I’m not… done…” Rynn spoke for the first time since Eydis pulled her from Austin’s lounge.
0,“You said… for every time…everyone that…”
0,Eydis’s heart collapsed within her chest.
0,"Her hands shook, and her knees gave out."
0,What am I making her do?
0,"Her orders forced Rynn to remember and relive each and every painful experience, to count how many times she had been hurt."
0,Eydis pulled the girl into a strong embrace.
0,"Rynn had a deeply rooted grief over what happened to her, her friends, and her people."
0,The overflowing pain spilled from the girl’s eyes.
0,"Eydis’s order had released Rynn’s pent-up anguish, making Austin the proxy for all Tolmyur had done."
0,“Then cry!
0,Forget about those monsters and cry.
0,Cry until the pain goes away.
0,It is okay to cry…”
0,"As if listening to her own advice, tears trickled down Eydis’s cheeks."
0,Rynn’s lips quivered.
0,The stream of tears became a torrent.
0,"Her dark crimson hands grabbed onto the sleeves of Eydis’s coat, and now with permission, Rynn wailed out the strongest cry Eydis had ever heard."
0,She held the small shaking body in the blood red snow under the cold moonlight until Rynn cried herself silent.
1,"* * *
Eydis sat with Rynn in the tub of the vacant house she had prepared for her."
0,"She found how to dispense water from the large spout, and they bathed together to remove the putrid human blood that had soaked Rynn through her dress."
0,"Eydis did not want to bring something so filthy back to Rynn’s new home, so she left the dress with Austin’s corpse."
0,"The blood had stained Rynn’s hair, and the human soap, though fragrant, was not strong enough to remove it."
0,Rynn noticed Eydis’s concern and ran her hair through her hands.
0,"As the hair slid through, the stain vanished, sticking to Rynn’s hands where it rinsed off with ease."
0,This was water magic new to Eydis.
0,This was the first time Eydis had ever seen Rynn use magic.
0,She embraced the girl.
0,"Rynn spoke, and she was using magic."
0,"This was progress, and it helped ease some of Eydis’s worry."
0,"She apologized again for forcing Rynn to do something so painful, but she was glad that it helped a little in its own small way."
0,"Inside the bedroom, Eydis searched the closet for a new dress."
0,The elderly woman who owned the house was thin and only a little taller than Rynn.
0,"After trying a few dresses, Rynn chose one she liked and that fit well enough."
0,"The thick fabric was white with a yellow floral pattern, and there were small ruffles around the waist and bottom of the dress."
0,"It was fairly worn, but the thick fabric would keep Rynn warm."
1,Eydis grabbed the largest knife from the kitchen to replace the one they left in the bloody field and teleported with Rynn back to the bedroom of the house on the outskirts.
0,She found the dwarf waiting in the living room.
0,He looked at the blood smears and red handprints on Eydis’s clothes and then at the new dress Rynn wore.
0,He reacted only with a twitch of his mustache.
0,Eydis breathed deep to steady her conviction.
0,“Tell me where your men are waiting.
0,"I will let you keep Rynn until you have the princess, but let me warn you, should anything happen to Rynn, I will use transmission to send the princess to the other side of this world so you will never find her again.”"
0,“Understood.
0,You have my word.
0,Are you sure you will not regret this?”
0,Eydis looked at Rynn who nodded back.
0,“Positive.”
0,Jethro’s men entered from the front and back doors.
0,Eydis stared at them in disbelief.
0,She never detected a lie when he said his men were heading to the university.
0,Eydis realized her mistake.
0,His words were that his men were moving into position.
0,He never said where or what position.
0,That vagueness provided an opening for deceptive truth.
0,His men were positioned without the house to await her decision.
0,The dwarf grew a complacent grin.
0,“Do not be so surprised.
0,I did not doubt you would choose to aid us.
0,Doppelganger tendencies are far too strong.”
0,Eydis realized that this was why she never considered ignoring the princess and leaving with Rynn.
0,"Again, she was painfully reminded of what she was."
0,The dwarf continued.
0,“I will be honest and say that I had hoped you would run away with the spriggan instead of deciding to take the princess’s place.
0,"I feel it would have been better for you, and I wanted to give you that option."
0,"If you chose it, only then would we have moved to strike in the morning."
0,"But now, we will follow your plan.”"
0,The two humans and the giant joined Eydis in the living room.
0,"“So, what is your plan?"
0,I assume that boy Austin was not important for it.”
0,"Chapter 21
“Eydis FeAmel”"
1,"“Good morning, my lady.” "
0,“Hello princess.” 
0,“That is quite the smile.” 
0,Guards and maids greeted Eydis as she passed them down the white-marble halls of the central palace.
0,"The quiet patter of her bare feet echoed off the stone, and the bright morning sun showered rainbow light on her through the large crystalline windows."
0,“You seem in a good mood.
0,Something nice happen?”
0,Eydis nodded back at the maid who walked by after her brief greeting.
0,She touched her cheeks and found them fixed into a large grin.
0,"She was happy, very happy, but she could not think of why."
0,"As she walked, she couldn’t remember the last time she felt this happy in the palace."
0,"The large hallway was on the second floor of the central wing of the palace, and if she continued walking, she would arrive at a large crescent staircase to the first-floor west wing."
0,"If she was in such a pleasant mood, then there was someone who lived in the west wing that Eydis wanted to share her mood with."
0,Eydis continued down the hallway and staircase with an increased perk to her step and excitedly greeted the guards and servants that passed her.
0,Soon the marriage of the girl in the west wing to the emperor would be made public with a grand celebration.
0,She would then have a regal room on the third floor of the palace beside Eydis’s mother and her father’s other wives.
0,"Ceil was probably still worried about the marriage announcement, but Eydis could not imagine her remaining sullen after Eydis spent the day with her."
0,The west wing was not as grand as the central palace.
0,"The rooms were designated for royal guests who had prolonged visits to the capital, not the royal family."
0,This did not mean it lacked in beauty.
0,The marble floors were not the same pristine white as the central palace but contained swirls of silver and copper tones that glistened in the golden sunlight through the smooth crystal windows.
0,Pedestals bearing large vases of flowers forever in bloom lined the walls.
0,Above each door hung a large tapestry depicting the landscapes of the various nations that belong to the Amelian Empire.
0,The grandest tapestry depicted fields of wheat woven with gold thread in front of alabaster mountains and emerald forests.
0,A small village sat in the center where children cheerfully ran through the fields while their parents watched in a loving embrace.
0,It was a scene from the Filinceil Plains of the northeastern countryside bordering the Nuanae range at the edge of the empire.
0,"The territory was the original home of the High Elves, once called Grassland Elves before the unification of the Amelian Empire."
0,Ceil hailed from such a village in the north.
0,Excitement hastened Eydis’s step.
0,She rushed to the door and knocked.
0,"“Ceil, may I come in?”"
0,“Eydis?
0,Yes!
0,Please!”
1,"Eydis swung the door open and ran inside, but no matter where she turned, Ceil was nowhere to be seen."
0,"“Are you hiding again?” Eydis shook her head at the girl’s childish games, but she was relieved."
0,This meant that Ceil was not in as poor a mood as she had thought.
0,The hunt began.
0,"Ceil had a habit of hiding in her wardrobe when she was younger, but as expected, Eydis came up empty-handed."
0,"Next, she searched under the bed, then behind the curtains."
0,"Of course, she would think of somewhere better to hide."
0,Eydis sat on the bed to think.
0,She ran over to the sofa and looked under the skirt.
0,Nothing.
0,"The chair skirts likewise revealed nothing, but Ceil was too big to fit completely under the chairs."
0,"After all, she was now a woman of marriageable age, only a year younger than Eydis, although her father had already married Ceil in private when Ceil was but a child, something Eydis openly opposed."
0,A smile grew on Eydis’s face.
0,She knew how to draw Ceil out of her hiding place.
0,“I must have been mistaken.
0,No one is here.” Eydis walked to the door and grabbed the handle.
0,“I suppose I should leave.”
0,"“But, you did leave me.” "
0,Air caught in Eydis’s throat.
0,She turned and saw a body in a pool of blood on the floor.
0,“Ceil!” Eydis ran to the center of the room in abject horror.
0,"The girl in a tattered purple dress had been severed in half through her stomach, her blood and viscera spilling out onto the white carpet."
0,Through the windows looking out to the west wing’s inner courtyard a bright purple and red flare flashed in the night sky.
0,“The assassination…”
1,"Eydis ran out of the room, down the hall, and to the central courtyard where her younger twin brothers often spent the evenings dueling."
0,"Like Ceil, both had been severed in half."
0,Their sabers pinned their bodies to the ground through their chest.
0,"Eydis’s heart raced with a thunderous, terrified pulse."
0,“Guards!
0,Somebody!”
0,"Eydis cried out, but the palace was empty."
0,She ran to the third floor.
0,Her mother’s room was empty as were the rooms of her father’s other wives.
0,"At the top floor of the palace, Eydis ran to her father’s chambers."
0,“No…”
0,"Her father and mother, her father’s other wives, they all laid dead in the lounge atop a pile of mutilated corpses of the maids, guards, and other servant she had greeted not moments earlier."
0,“How does it feel to have everyone you love stolen from you?
0,You brought this upon yourself.
0,"Now it’s just you, princess.”"
0,A haunting voice called to Eydis from the corridor of the bedchamber.
0,The human assassin waved his arm and launched a near-invisible planar projectile towards Eydis.
0,Eydis coated her arm in vibrating spatial ven and blocked the barrier that threatened to slice her in two.
0,The force knocked Eydis back into one of the chairs.
0,The barrier split and embedded itself into the floor and sofa behind her.
0,"Another attack did not follow, so Eydis used the opening to run out the door."
0,“Somebody!
0,Help!”
0,Eydis’s futile cry echoed through the empty halls.
1,"At the stairway to the lower floors, a portal opened in front of Eydis."
0,"Before she could react, the assassin attacked again."
0,Somebody tackled Eydis from the side.
0,The barrier missed by a small margin and sliced through the wall behind her.
0,“Run!”
0,The familiar voice soothed Eydis’s fear.
0,A short human man with blond hair and the deepest blue eyes pulled Eydis to her feet and down the hall.
0,“Justin?”
0,"A portal opened in front of them, and the assassin attacked."
0,"Justin jumped in front of Eydis, and the blunt barrier knocked them both to their back across the smooth marble floor."
0,Eydis couldn’t move.
0,"She could only watch as Justin struggled to his feet and stood in front of her, blocking the assassin."
0,The assassin lifted his hand.
0,“Do not hurt him!
0,He is not part of this!” she screamed to deaf ears.
0,"The assassin swung his hand downward, and Justin split in half from his head to his legs."
1,Eydis lunged up from her bed.
0,Her chest dripped with cold sweat.
0,The fear of what she saw sent uncontrollable shivers through her body.
0,“Justin…”
0,She threw off her covers and flung her door open.
0,Justin slept peacefully on the couch with soft breaths matching the subtle rise and fall of his chest.
0,"Strength left Eydis’s legs, and she dropped to her knees."
0,It was a dream.
0,It was nothing but a terrible dream.
0,"These nightmares had repeated themselves countless times since Eydis came to Earth, but this was the first time Justin had been part of them."
0,It was the first time Eydis had seen Justin among those who were killed.
0,Eydis wiped the sweat from her face and leaned back against the arm of the couch.
0,She needed to calm down or Justin might wake.
0,"The clock on the wall read 6a.m., so Justin would not rise for another two or three hours."
0,"He did not have morning classes today, so Eydis wanted him to sleep as long as possible."
0,She looked beside her to his sleeping face hanging almost off the couch.
0,His soft breaths tickled her cheek.
0,She watched Justin sleep as the hands of the clock spun until the panic in her mind ebbed and her heart calmed.
0,"So long as he was here, she would be okay, not because she was even the least bit confident in his ability to protect her--she wasn’t--but because his very presence calmed her troubled mind, although she was unsure why or how that came to be."
1,"After sitting beside Justin for an hour, Eydis rose to her feet and returned to her room."
0,"In the months that she had lived there, Justin’s scent that permeated the room had been replaced by hers."
0,The blankets and pillow on the bed were new.
0,Eydis bought them with her first paycheck so that Justin could have sufficient blankets in the living room to be comfortable during the cold winter nights.
0,Justin also bought her a thick pillow-top comforter as a gift for one of this world’s year-end holidays.
0,"Eydis hugged her comforter, somewhat wishing that his scent was on it, but shook the foolish thought from her mind."
0,"The nightmare had made her sweat, and there would be at least another hour before Justin woke, so Eydis decided to take a bath."
0,She retrieved sky-blue undergarments from the dresser and removed a set of jeggings and shirt from the closet.
1,She carried them to the bathroom and closed the door.
0,"The fan in the bathroom was loud, so Eydis opted to only open the bathroom window for ventilation, letting the frigid air enter."
0,"To prevent Justin from waking, she also opened the tub faucet only a little to let the tub fill slowly."
0,"Long ago Eydis learned that there was little risk of suffocating when taking a bath compared to taking a shower, and baths felt far better, even if keeping herself submerged was a constant struggle."
0,"On Whinhlem, baths in the palace were always shallow, but she was drawing her own baths now, so she made them as deep as possible."
0,"She laughed at herself, remembering almost passing out on her first day on Earth due to a simple shower."
0,"She was ignorant of a lot of the differences between Whinhlem and Earth, but now everything was second nature."
0,"She could live here as easily as in her own world, if not easier."
0,Eydis removed her fleece sweatpants and soaked in the water.
0,"The heat stung a bit at first, but she quickly grew accustomed and relaxed her tense muscles."
0,"It was only a dream, she reminded herself."
0,A sigh of contentment escaped Eydis’s lips.
0,She did not need to bathe.
0,She had bathed just the evening before and would bathe once again after her self-defense class and magic lessons.
0,The cold sweat was just an excuse to relax and forget about the nightmare.
0,Eydis rested her cheek atop her arm on the edge of the tub.
0,Another content sigh escaped her lips.
0,Her other hand found its way to her lower back and her tail.
0,A light caress of her tail sent shivers up her spine.
0,She rubbed it and twisted it around in her fingers.
0,Each motion sent a numbing wave through her body.
0,"Her maids that helped bathe her in the palace would have surely scolded her for still playing with her tail at her age, but even being able to do so was a testament to Eydis of just how comfortable she felt living here in Justin and Sean’s apartment."
0,She recalled the many times early on when Justin had nearly seen her tail.
0,Eydis sank her head under the water.
0,I wonder what he would have thought if he saw it…
0,Eydis’s face grew hot and she shook the foolish thought from her mind.
0,She sat up and laughed quietly to herself.
0,She thought back on the struggles during the early weeks after her arrival on Earth.
0,She never had the opportunity to mourn the loss of her family.
0,"She suppressed her grief as much as possible, but more than once she had cried herself ragged in Sammy’s arms--weakness she felt she could never show Justin."
0,She struggled to be as unobtrusive as possible and worked hard to pay back Justin and Sean for their kindness in letting her stay.
0,"Sean was always stern with her, but after she healed him of his lactose intolerance, he finally accepted her."
0,"Justin had done much for her, and even though he could not recognize his ven, he discovered his affinity, and she was working with him daily to help him with his toxic ven."
0,"He never blamed her for her inabilities, and he constantly thanked her for even the smallest of things she did."
0,"After months of honest effort, this small apartment by the river truly felt like home."
1,"After the bath, Eydis cooked breakfast."
0,She pulled eggs and milk from the fridge and grabbed small jars of cinnamon and nutmeg.
0,She mixed the milk and eggs together and seasoned the mixture with the spices.
0,She then removed wheat bread from the breadbox and heated a pan.
0,She dipped the bread in the mixture and fried it on the pan until the eggs cooked through.
0,French toast was Justin’s favorite breakfast.
0,"Eydis found it rather peculiar and something that only humans would ever think up, but when topped with sweet cream and fruit preserves, she found it a very delectable food that she counted among her favorite meals of this world."
0,Eydis chanced a glance back at Justin and saw him watching her in silence.
0,“Good morning.”
0,"“Morning…” Justin’s smile met hers, and he rolled over under his blankets to face the other way."
0,Eydis could not help but chuckle.
0,“I will be finished soon.
0,You should think of getting up so you can eat while it is hot.”
0,A muffled noise was the only reply.
0,"When Justin had morning classes, he rose and prepared for departure rather quickly, but on his workdays when he could sleep in, getting him off the couch was a struggle."
0,This did not bother Eydis.
0,She found it charming in her own way.
0,"Finishing the tenth slice of bread--two for her, four for Justin, and four for Sean whenever he would wake--Eydis plated them and brought her and Justin’s portions to the table."
0,She covered Sean’s with plastic wrap and placed it in the fridge with a note on it.
0,Sean would normally skip breakfast if it was not made for him.
0,This was another idea Eydis found to repay him.
0,"It was small, but she knew he appreciated it."
0,"Despite hearing the clatter of the plates and utensils, Justin did not stir."
0,Eydis walked over and crouched down in front of him.
0,“It is ready.”
0,She tapped him on the shoulder.
0,Justin stirred once more and looked at Eydis with his sleep-drunken eyes.
0,A few blinks later he sat up and stretched his arms.
0,Eydis offered her hand and pulled him off the couch.
0,They ate together and spent the morning in idle chatter about nothing important.
0,It was simple moments like this that Eydis enjoyed the most.
0,Sean woke up only moments before Justin and Eydis left.
0,"Eydis pointed at the fridge, and Sean thanked her with a smile before seeing them out the door."
1,"* * *
Eydis looked at the girl sleeping soundly in her embrace."
0,She ran her fingers through Rynn’s wheat-colored hair and admired the sparse strands of almost metallic-seeming silver.
0,She knew there was some cultural significance to silver markings among Forest Elves but could not recall what it was or if it was ever included in her limited education.
0,"Though Rynn stirred at Eydis’s touch, she did not wake."
0,"Her breath was heavy from the lack of air in this world, which made sleep difficult for Rynn, but she fell asleep eventually so long as Eydis was there."
0,Eydis held Rynn close to slowly recover as much ven as possible through contact for the monumental task later that day.
0,"Rynn recovered ven very slowly, so they had spent the entire previous day with each other so that Eydis had enough for the battle that would likely ensue that evening."
0,"The clock on the wall read a few minutes before 8a.m., still mid-morning in this world."
0,"The princess would not arrive at the university until late morning, about 10 a.m. or a little after depending on which bus they caught."
0,Eydis could not arrive before the princess for fear of someone noticing her and unknowingly informing the princess.
0,This only meant that she had more time with Rynn.
0,Regret weighed upon Eydis.
0,"Rynn trusted her unconditionally, and soon she would leave Rynn in the hands of the humans, the same people from which she swore to protect Rynn, but it would only be for a short time."
0,Eydis pulled Rynn into a tighter embrace and felt the syphoning of ven increase.
0,"Even with all the preparation and planning, she could still fail, and in the worst case she could die, leaving Rynn alone in this strange world or worse, consign her to the hands of Jethro’s soldiers."
0,The house Eydis secured was for Rynn’s comfort in this world more than her own.
0,This was all for Rynn.
1,"* * *
“Eydis!”"
0,"“Good morning, Sammy.” "
0,Justin and Eydis met Sammy at the bus stop on the edge of campus.
0,"As usual while Justin worked, Eydis accompanied Sammy to her biology and swim classes."
0,Justin left the two after a simple wave and headed to the student service and commons building.
0,“I still cannot believe that you can get paid for simply answering questions at a help desk.”
0,"“I find it more unbelievable you thought Justin was an information broker.” Sammy laughed, and Eydis shook her head in embarrassment."
0,“An information broker would be even more unbelievable in our world.
0,"With the internet, information is as free as air."
0,"Not that there aren’t secrets or anything out there, but Justin would be the absolute LAST person who would have a job like that!”"
0,"Sammy laughed again, and Eydis bumped into her with her hip as they walked down the stone walkway."
1,They arrived at a single-story building on the eastern edge of campus.
0,It served the purpose of providing overflow classrooms for courses that could not fit in the designated college buildings.
0,Sammy’s molecular biology class was held in one of the underground lecture halls of this building.
0,The professor had a reputation for being strict and heavy on memorization of even the minutest details in his lectures.
0,"Sammy would have chosen the second section with a different professor, but the timing of this section better allowed her and Justin to synchronize their schedules to trade off accompanying Eydis, and for that, Eydis was grateful."
0,Eydis also enjoyed the lectures.
0,"The professor’s love of details proved invaluable to her understanding of the human and even her own elven body, and it was because of this class that she had enough understanding to heal Sean of his lactose intolerance."
0,"Eydis was quickly learning that there was very little difference between a human and an elf, body density aside."
0,The professor reciprocated Eydis’s enjoyment of the class.
0,"Normally, non-students needed permission to officially apply to audit the course, but after only a week of Eydis attending, the professor noticed her love of study."
0,Eydis’s questions were pointed and not only led to greater understanding for the students but also contributed to the flow of the lecture.
0,"To him, she was the perfect student."
0,"Sammy, however, did not share the sentiment."
0,“I’m struggling enough as it is in that class…”
0,"The discussions often became too deep for her to follow, and much of this was because of Eydis’s questions."
0,“At least I can forget about all that while I swim.”
0,"“That attitude is why you struggle,” Eydis cautioned."
0,Sammy bumped into Eydis with her shoulder.
1,The university’s pools sat inside a structure just southwest of the health and fitness building.
0,"Sammy’s swim class was less structured than other fitness courses in that so long as the students attended and recorded their activities and progress, they received credit."
0,"It was not a class for beginning swimmers, and a few members of the university’s swim team attended."
0,"The professor only served as an emergency lifeguard, but she was often absent, so the swim team members with lifeguard certifications took turns filling in for her with her permission."
0,"Normally, Eydis sat on the side of the pool and watched, but this time Sammy had other plans."
0,She pulled Eydis into the locker room and removed a swimsuit from her backpack.
0,The dark green one-piece swimsuit had a sewn-in skirt attached around the waist that would help conceal the bump from Eydis’s tail.
0,It came with an accompanying swim cap large enough to hold Eydis’s hair if wound tightly and came down far enough to cover the tips of her ears.
0,“It should fit.
0,Your size hasn’t changed from the last time we went shopping.”
0,Eydis hugged Sammy.
0,She never thought of joining Sammy in the pool due to concern over her elven traits being revealed.
0,"Once again, she felt even more that she was finally fitting into human society."
0,"There were no individual booths in the locker room, so Sammy held a towel in front of Eydis to conceal her while she changed."
0,The swimsuit fit perfectly.
0,"The form of her ears showed under the swim cap, so Sammy had to wind Eydis’s hair over the tips of her ears to mask the shape."
1,The large room contained two Olympic-sized swimming pools and one short-course pool that was shallow at one end.
0,Sammy usually kept to the short-course pool while the swim team members attending the class swam laps in the larger pools.
0,"She hopped into the shallow end, her chin barely above the four-foot-deep water."
0,Eydis sat on the edge and slid in.
0,"This was her first time in deep water in this world, and as expected she could not easily keep her feet on the floor of the pool."
0,She immediately became buoyant and pulled her knees in to keep from floating to her back.
0,This caused no small amount of laughter from Sammy.
0,“I guess we never have to worry about you drowning.”
0,"“It is no different than Whinhlem, so swimming should not be a problem.” "
0,Eydis pushed off the edge of the pool and began an elementary backstroke down Sammy and her lane.
0,Her body never sank below the surface of the water.
0,Once she reached the other side she switched to a breaststroke--or what could be called a breaststroke--for the return.
0,Sammy fought to hold in her laughter.
0,“Did I look that strange?” Eydis asked.
0,“I can honestly say I have never seen anyone swim like that before.” Sammy swam off and skillfully repeated the strokes Eydis had done.
0,"From what Eydis felt while swimming and what she saw Sammy do, there was a strong difference."
0,Their weight differed by about forty pounds in Sammy’s favor.
0,Their body density made all the difference.
0,"Eydis’s form looked odd to Sammy because of Eydis’s buoyancy, but she could do nothing about that."
0,"She could only swim how she learned in Whinhlem, which was designed for those highly buoyant like her."
0,"After a few more laps, Sammy pulled Eydis aside to the edge of the pool."
0,“I want to show you something.” 
0,Sammy placed her palms on the surface of the water and pushed up.
0,She rose about a foot out of the water and held herself there for a few seconds before dropping down.
0,"“I can do it with my feet too, but keeping balance is really hard.”"
0,Sammy then held her hands out in front of her under the water.
0,"Without any motion on her part, she flowed backwards as if being carried away by a slow current."
0,“I can propel myself much faster than that too.”
0,"“Where do you practice?” Eydis asked, astonished."
0,"Sammy would not be able during her swim class with so many people watching, and Eydis was always with her."
0,She had never seen Sammy practice here.
0,“There is a small indoor pool at the dorms.
0,"It’s closed in winter, but the hot tub remains open."
0,I practice when no one is around.”
0,Eydis was astonished by how far Sammy progressed.
0,"Sammy had struggled to control her ven, but now that she learned her magic could be applied to swimming, she had an increased determination to master it."
0,“You’re finally in the water.”
0,"Two men, both members of the swim team, walked over to the corner of the small pool next to Sammy and Eydis."
0,“I saw you swimming earlier.
0,"If you want someone to teach you how to do a proper breaststroke, I would be happy to teach you.”"
0,"“Of all the swimming pickup lines, you choose stroking breasts?” Sammy shook her head with a playful smirk."
0,“We could show you proper form.
0,"It’s just a matter of practice,” the second spoke up, completely ignoring Sammy’s attempt at turning their offer into a double entendre."
0,Sammy climbed the edge of the pool and stood in front of the two men.
0,“Eydis knows how to swim just fine.
0,She’s just one of those people who are more buoyant than most.
0,She floats without trying.”
0,"“I am fine,” Eydis echoed in goodwill."
0,“Sammy is helping me well enough.”
0,“She can join.
0,We could show her a few things as well.” 
0,Eydis sensed no malice in the two’s kind gesture.
0,"They only wanted to help, so she considered humoring them, but Sammy shook her head."
0,“How about a race?
0,"If I beat you, you leave Eydis and me alone."
0,Which one of you is faster?”
0,The two men looked at each other confused.
0,One pointed his thumb at the other.
0,"“Kris, so you probably don’t want to race him.”"
0,“Kris it is.” 
1,Sammy walked to her bag and drank half her water bottle at once.
0,She then walked over to a lane in the full-length pools and stood on her pedestal.
0,The occupant noticed the ensuing spectacle and cleared the lane.
0,“Are you coming or not?” Sammy jeered.
0,“She can’t be serious…” Kris looked at Eydis with bewilderment.
0,Eydis only shook her head and hopped out of the pool to follow Sammy.
0,“200-meter freestyle sound good to you?” Sammy asked.
0,"“Are you sure about racing me,” Kris asked back after mounting his pedestal."
0,“I wouldn’t have challenged you if I wasn’t.
0,Don’t hold back.
0,I’ve been wanting to test myself for a while now.”
0,Sammy nodded at the other swim team member who shook his head in disbelief but began counting down.
0,"At his call, Kris and Sammy dove into the water."
0,Kris appeared above the water a full five meters past Sammy.
0,"He continually gained distance over Sammy, but to the astonishment of Kris’s teammate, the distance did not grow very fast."
0,"As she was, Sammy could have been considered one of the faster members of the women’s swim team."
0,Kris kicked off the far side of the pool and began his return.
0,"Sammy followed, but her kick had a lot more force to it."
0,"She not only gained a few meters on Kris, but she also no longer lost distance."
0,Only about a fifteen-meter gap separated them.
0,"With the kick to begin the final lap, Sammy gained another few meters and was even gaining on Kris."
0,“Impossible…”
0,"At this time most of the swimmers in the pool had stopped swimming, and a few other students around the pool watched the race."
0,Eydis could not have been prouder of how far her student progressed.
0,The gap closed to less than five meters when Kris and Sammy met the far edge of the pool.
0,"After they kicked off, Sammy was only a meter behind."
0,"The onlookers cheered Sammy on while the swim team watched in disbelief, shouting at their team member to stop going easy on her, but they all knew he wasn’t."
0,Kris swam with the same seriousness he had at meets.
0,"At the 25-meter line, Sammy passed Kris."
0,The onlookers went crazy with shouts that echoed across the spacious room.
0,"Victory was clearly Sammy’s to all who watched, but past the 15-meter mark, Sammy began to falter."
0,Her meter gain on Kris lessened until they fell neck in neck.
0,The onlookers watched with bated breath as Sammy and Kris touched the edge of the pool.
0,Two swim team members raised their hand in Sammy’s favor.
0,The spectators erupted in a deafening cheer at the impossible sight of a five-foot tall woman beating a top member of the men’s swim team.
0,"Sammy tried to climb up the edge of the pool, but her arms shook too much from exhaustion."
0,Kris lifted her in the water while his friend grabbed her hand.
0,“That was amazing!”
0,“I didn’t know you could swim like that!” 
0,“What was that?” 
0,Sammy lay on her back and looked up at the group of people surrounding her.
0,“Are you okay?”
0,“You look pale.” 
0,“I just ran out of juice.
0,That’s all.” Sammy forced the biggest smile she could.
0,“Can someone grab my water?”
0,Kris’s friend hurried over to Sammy’s bag to retrieve her water bottle.
0,Eydis immediately recognized what was wrong.
0,"She knelt down, pulled Sammy to sit, and placed her forehead against hers."
0,Sammy only had about a tenth of her ven left.
0,She pushed herself far past the critical mark by sheer willpower.
0,"Magic to control movement in water took very little ven, but Sammy currently lacked control, so much was wasted in order to attain the speed Sammy needed."
0,Eydis placed her hands on the side of Sammy’s head.
0,"Sammy’s capacity was far less than Eydis’s, so she replenished all Sammy’s missing ven."
0,Color returned to Sammy’s face and her shivering stopped.
0,Sammy retrieved her water bottle from the one who fetched it and drained the rest.
0,“Can you fill it again?”
0,Sammy handed off the bottle and returned to her back.
0,"Even though Eydis replenished her ven, the physical exhaustion from the swim remained."
0,"Eydis could not have felt prouder of Sammy, but reprimanding her student was also her duty as a teacher."
0,“That was incredibly careless of you.
0,You pushed yourself too hard.”
0,Sammy smiled wryly.
0,“Are you doping or something?” Kris knelt next to Sammy with disbelief painted over his face.
0,“No way.
0,"I’ll let you in on a secret, though."
0,"You wanted to teach Eydis how to swim, but the truth is, Eydis is the one coaching me."
0,She is the reason I can swim like that.”
0,"Kris shook his head, but then smiled."
0,“This is my defeat.
0,Ever think of joining the swim team?
0,"With some practice, I bet you could medal in the Olympics.”"
0,“No way.
0,Swimming is just a hobby for me.
0,I don’t want to make it my job.
0,That’d ruin it.
0,"Despite how I look now, I do it to relax.”"
0,Kris chuckled.
0,"“That’s a serious waste of good talent, but I can respect that.”"
0,“And don’t think of trying to pull Eydis into coaching the swim team.
0,She’s already got her hands full teaching a self-defense class.”
0,Kris looked at Eydis who shook her head lightly.
0,He clicked his tongue in disappointment.
0,“Then this is definitely a loss for me.”
0,Sammy spent the remainder of the class resting against the wall next to Eydis and downing bottle after bottle of water until her stomach bulged.
0,She chatted with the students who stuck with her but dodged any questions about what Eydis taught that helped her improve so much.
0,"After the class, an hour remained before Justin’s shift ended, so Eydis and Sammy meandered around campus, met up with Chloe, and enjoyed each other’s company until Chloe had to leave for her class."
0,"When Justin arrived, it was Sammy’s turn to go to work for a couple hours with the promise that she would see Eydis later that evening."
1,"* * *
“Promise me Rynn will come to no harm,” Eydis demanded."
0,"“You have my word, so long as you do your part.”"
0,The dwarf extended his hand to Rynn who reluctantly extended hers.
0,He pulled her away from Eydis and handed her off to the two humans who accompanied them to this world.
0,"Rynn tried to appear strong, but tears slowly collected in the corners of her eyes."
0,"“If I hear from Rynn that you so much as looked at her with lust in your eyes, if I so much as see a single scratch or bruise or loose thread on her clothing, you will suffer a death far worse than Austin.”"
0,"When the dwarf realized that Eydis killed Austin, he was not angry."
0,He only asked for the location of the body and sent his men to retrieve it.
0,"The brutality of the murder made one of the humans ill, and that same human now held Rynn’s shoulder."
0,His face grew pale after hearing Eydis’s threat.
0,"Eydis glared at each human, dwarf, minum, and giant with her deep red eyes as a final warning."
0,She then vanished with a snap.
1,Eydis jumped out from behind the bushes in the back of one of the buildings on the south side of campus.
0,"There was no walkway here, only foliage, grass, and eventually a wall marking the border of the campus."
0,"It was the most vacant location on campus, and being on the south side, the princess would not be able to recognize Eydis’s spatial magic."
0,"Although, from previous spatial magic use during her observation of the princess, the princess’s perception range was rather small as expected."
0,The students walking to and from the various buildings paid Eydis no mind.
0,Eydis disguised herself with a large coat and baggy pants and had a woven cap with her hair wrapped and bound tight inside.
0,"The cap covered her ears, and a scarf was wrapped around her mouth."
0,Only the bridge of her nose and her eyes showed.
0,"Judging by how the students reacted to the princess whenever they saw her, Eydis was confident in her disguise."
0,No one recognized her.
0,"When Eydis looked in the mirror of the bedroom after she changed into these clothes, she could not even tell she was a woman."
0,The large clothing hid all her femininity.
0,She looked like a tall human male of this world.
0,Eydis picked up her pace with confidence that she would not be discovered and headed to the north side of the campus to the health and fitness building.
0,She withdrew the map Austin had drawn the day he died.
0,"It was torn and bloody from Rynn’s revenge but was still legible, barely."
0,"If she had a little more forethought, she would have taken it from him beforehand."
0,"The princess currently accompanied her friend, Sammy, at the swimming class and would remain there for an hour."
0,"The proximity of the class to where Eydis headed was a cause for concern, but Eydis would be able to tell if the princess moved from that location due to her doppelganger instincts."
0,"Even if she saw the princess, Eydis felt that the princess would not be able to recognize her."
1,"Once inside the large glass doors, Eydis followed the directions down the main hallway and turned to a smaller pathway on the right."
0,A door opened into a small open-air enclosure at the end.
0,Another door on the other side led to a wing of the building with a few smaller rooms containing desks.
0,"There were no students here, and all the rooms were empty."
0,A women’s restroom sat at the end of the hall.
0,Eydis entered and found a door to the right with a sign that read “Changing Room.”
0,A large mirror and bench stretched along one side.
0,Three private stalls lined the wall on the other.
0,There was a small opening to a single shower across from the entrance.
0,"Eydis had initially planned to confront the princess here to speak with her and probe the truth of the princess’s life in this world, hoping that she was somehow mistaken in her assumptions made from her observations."
0,"Now that Rynn was in the hands of the soldiers, that was not an option, at least for now."
0,Her hand was forced.
0,Eydis entered the middle stall so that she could be next to the princess no matter which stall the princess used.
0,There she waited.
1,"* * *
“Sammy really surprised me."
0,Your body naturally shuts off access to your ven when it decreases to dangerous levels.
0,"An incredible amount of training is needed to force your body to use ven it refuses to give, and she did it like it was second nature.” "
0,“Sounds like her.
0,She’s a stubborn one.”
0,Justin followed beside Eydis cheerfully listening to her ramblings about what she saw Sammy do at the pool.
0,“And how fast she was able to control water ven is astounding.
0,She might be more of a natural than I thought.
0,Sammy just needed the right motivation.”
0,"“So Sammy, Chloe, and Miriam are all naturals?"
0,Maybe humans of our world are far more adept at magic than those of your world.
0,Not that I can say anything about myself.
0,I still can’t feel my own ven.”
0,Eydis stopped walking.
0,The assassin who attacked her family far surpassed even Emer in spatial magic.
0,She could not rule out the possibility that more humans existed that could surpass elfkind in magic ability.
0,"Justin, a human with a ven capacity so large that she was scared to inform him honestly about just how large it was, had an affinity to time magic, something unheard of in Whinhlem."
0,Even a spatial affinity would be considered so incredibly rare for a human to possess that Eydis was sure the number of humans that possessed it throughout the entire history of Whinhlem could be counted on one hand.
0,Where did that human assassin come from?
0,Justin held his hand out to Eydis.
0,He could sense something was troubling her.
0,"She grasped it, and a smile returned to her face as they headed towards the health and fitness building to prepare for the self-defense class."
1,"When Eydis and Justin arrived at the door to the large vacant room where the class would be held, Eydis squeezed his hand tighter before letting go and continuing down the hall."
0,"Ever since Justin learned that Eydis still had anxiety over her situation here on Earth, he became far more sensitive to it, almost as if he was actively watching for when something worried her."
0,Eydis opened and closed her hand.
0,The gentle warmth of his grasp lingered.
0,He had to know that those small gestures brought her more comfort than anything else could.
0,He was always thinking of her.
0,Eydis smiled to herself as she opened the door to the small open-air enclosure but stopped in front of the adjacent door.
0,“I am taking him for granted.
0,I must make sure to thank him for always looking out for me.” Eydis opened the door with a glowing smile.
0,“Sammy as well.
0,She decreased her work hours so that I would always have someone with me.” She giggled.
0,“Maybe my debt has not yet been repaid.”
0,The friends Eydis met in this world were more than Eydis could have ever wished for.
0,"Chloe, and even her newest friend, Miriam, did their utmost to make sure that Eydis was cared for."
0,It was not out of pity of her situation.
0,It was not because Eydis was from another world and was sent here after losing her family.
0,"At least, she was positive that these were not the primary factors."
0,Everyone genuinely loved her.
0,She knew this and felt it every day.
0,“I must thank them all again.” Eydis’s feet continued with a light perk to her step.
1,The women’s restroom door creaked as did the door to the small changing room.
0,"Today, the middle stall was in use--rare."
0,Eydis took the one on the right and removed her bag.
0,She emptied her pockets of her phone and apartment key setting them next to her bag on the small bench.
0,I will definitely thank them.
0,Sammy and Justin’s birthdays are coming up.
0,I will use that opportunity.
0,Eydis removed her cap and jacket and was about to unbutton her pants.
0,--Spatial ven--
0,"Eydis’s mind worked at lightning speed to erect a barrier, but she found herself standing in a snowy field."
0,"A giant, four humans, a dwarf, and two minums surrounded her at a distance."
0,The dwarf stared at Eydis with a pleased grin.
0,“Hello princess.”
1,"* * *
That was close…"
0,"Just as Eydis thought, the princess recognized the spatial magic and almost took countermeasures."
0,The instantaneous nature of transmission was the only reason she had succeeded before a barrier was erected.
0,Now Eydis needed to hurry.
0,"She did not doubt that the princess could defend herself, but she did not know what tricks Jethro’s men had prepared."
0,Eydis worked quickly to recall her memorized formula and disappeared.
1,The two humans startled at Eydis’s sudden appearance in the bedroom of the house on the outskirts.
0,"Rynn knelt back against the headboard of the bed with her knife extended and pointing towards the soldier who sat lazily on the end of the bed, facing her."
0,"Of all the places in the room, the man sat on the same bed as Rynn, somewhere he knew his proximity would trouble her."
0,"Eydis swiped her hand, and the head of the human who sat on the bed flew from its shoulders."
0,His body rolled off the bed to the floor.
0,Color drained from the remaining man’s face as he realized that Eydis was betraying them.
0,He ran to the door but could not escape the barrier that split him from his left shoulder through his back.
0,His body buckled and crumbled onto the ground.
0,Eydis hurried to Rynn and pulled her off the bed into an embrace.
0,“I will join you shortly.
0,Wait for me.” 
0,Rynn vanished with transmission’s snap.
0,Eydis removed her cumbersome coat and scarf and ran to the kitchen.
0,"There she located the final piece of her preparation on the floor by the back door, preparation for if the princess was uncooperative."
0,The humans provided as expected.
0,"She sent it to the cellar of the house, her transmission spell crackling from the peculiar metal’s natural resistance to magic."
1,"* * *
“Hello princess.”"
0,"Eydis barely managed to erect a barrier before being assaulted by wind, fire, and earth magic."
0,"She needed to escape, but her ability with spatial magic was insufficient to concurrently fight and create a teleportation formula, and even if she could, with this many opponents she doubted she would have time to use it."
0,Her training with Symra ended before she was proficient enough in spatial magic from Emer’s lessons to apply it in combat drills.
0,"The barrier waned quickly, and the heat from the fire magic made her sweat."
0,Eydis ran in the direction of two humans and altered her barrier in front to allow wind magic to pass.
0,"She could not see the exact location of the humans amid the barrage, so she swung her arm in a large arch to blindly launch a wide blade of wind."
0,"A wind spear passed through the fire and grazed her shoulder, but another did not follow."
0,She continued running and passed the body of a human on the ground.
0,"The explosions of fire ceased and the snow at her feet clumped up around her, tripping her."
0,Eydis turned on the ground to face her attackers and refreshed the barrier.
0,The giant stood in front of her.
0,His arms as thick as her torso rose together with hands clasped tight.
0,"Eydis quickly reinforced the barrier to defend against physical attacks, but it was futile in the brunt of the giant’s strength."
0,The barrier could not absorb the blow.
0,The force of the impact into her barrier slammed Eydis to her back.
0,"Her joints popped and creaked in protest, and the recoil of the ven used in the barrier numbed her arms."
0,"The barrier shattered, but she survived."
0,The giant’s arms rose again.
0,Eydis rolled and kicked off the ground.
0,"The impact into the ground blew dirt and snow in all directions, and a small crater remained."
0,Her barrier was not weak.
0,The giant was far too powerful.
0,"Eydis sprung to her feet to run, but the humans had repositioned themselves surrounding her while she was down."
0,A fireball flew at her.
0,"She tried to dodge, but the snow clumped at her feet again."
0,Another makeshift barrier protected Eydis from the explosion that not only enveloped her but also the giant.
0,Eydis sensed faint spatial magic from the nearby house.
0,Tolmyur reinforcements might have arrived.
0,"When the fire cleared, the lightly singed giant charged."
0,"His arm reeled back, ready to strike with the immense force of his momentum."
0,Wind gathered in Eydis’s hands.
0,She expelled it with enough power to blow away the snow that bound her and launch her through the air.
0,The impact of the giant’s strike missed Eydis by only a few feet.
0,"The debris shot from the ground in the direction of one of the minums who attempted to shield himself with his arms, but the spray of rock and dirt blew him back into a motionless heap on the frigid ground."
0,“That’s why I was against bringing that seknum monster!” shouted the minum beside him who barely managed to avoid the debris.
0,Eydis landed in the snow twenty feet away from the impact and rolled into the feet of one of the humans.
0,He drew his sword and thrust it at her chest.
0,Eydis rolled to the side and kicked her left foot into the sword hand of the man.
0,The blow deflected the blade away.
0,She used the momentum of the kick to spin to her back and place her hands on the ground by her shoulders.
0,"With a push, she sprung up backwards to land on her feet."
0,The human thrust at her again when she landed.
0,She hit the flat side of the blade with the palm of her left hand and deflected it to the left.
0,Another human encroached from behind and swung his sword upward.
0,Eydis barely noticed in time to arch her back out of the way.
0,"The blade grazed her right arm near the elbow, but the cut was shallow."
0,"The faint sensation of more spatial ven came from the house, or she thought it did."
0,She was now too far to tell clearly.
0,Eydis stepped into the first human to keep within sword range.
0,"He drew his sword back to give room for a strike, but Eydis grabbed his free wrist."
0,"She lifted the arm, tucked herself under, and with her body locked into the right alignment, she struck the man in the side."
0,"Her unconverted ven pulsed through her form and into her strike, disrupting the flow of ven in the man."
0,He buckled and fell to the ground from the strike that would otherwise be harmless.
0,"This was the true nature of the martial art she learned and now taught, to manipulate and control both the user’s and opponent’s ven."
0,"Eydis conjured a small wind spear to end his life, but out of the corner of her eye, a dark projectile approached."
0,"She tried to dodge, but the snow clumped at her feet again."
0,She twisted her body enough to avoid the small stone spike launched by the minum.
0,"Before falling to her back, Eydis managed to impale the wind spear into the neck of the stunned human she grounded."
0,"Again, Eydis felt spatial ven from the direction of the house."
0,"If more soldiers were arriving, she needed to escape quickly."
0,But the soldiers barely let her breathe let alone provided her an opening to escape.
0,The snow around Eydis clumped at her arms and legs and pinned her to the ground.
0,The remaining human raised his sword and swung down at Eydis’s neck.
0,"She was sure he could not use magic, or he would have already, so she formed an emergency physical barrier at the location the strike landed."
0,"Unfazed, the human continued his assault while Eydis could not move."
0,"All the while, stone spikes propelled at incredible speed by air magic flew at Eydis between sword strikes."
0,Eydis was forced to defend against two types of attacks from two directions.
0,She could not move.
0,She could not escape.
0,The humans caught her.
0,"Chapter 22
“A Helping Hand”
Eydis"
1,Eydis flung opened the back door.
0,"Near the center of the snowy field, the princess defended against blow after blow with quickly formed barriers."
0,"She had eliminated a few of the humans already, but her situation was dire."
0,"She had no chance of retaliating, and once her ven ran out, that would be the end."
0,What confused Eydis was what pinned the princess.
0,"She couldn’t see anything or anyone holding her, but the princess could not move."
0,The surviving minum hurled stone spike after stone spike at the princess.
0,A human mage stood afar while another human attacked with swift strikes from his blade.
0,The giant appeared ready to charge.
0,The dwarf leading the group knelt in the snow closer to the house.
0,"He only observed the fight when she expected him to be at the vanguard, being a dwarf."
0,"Instead, the dwarf buried his hands in the snow."
0,Eydis understood immediately that he was using the snow to bind the princess.
0,"The giant charged, spurring Eydis to action."
0,"If she did not intervene, she knew the princess would not survive."
0,She ran with all her Lurr strength toward the dwarf.
0,Snow and dirt blew out behind each step.
0,"She swung her arm, targeting his neck."
0,A thick wall of ice shot up from the snow behind the dwarf.
0,He felt her approach in the snow he controlled.
0,The impact of Eydis’s arm blew away the ice wall and showered the dwarf in frozen shrapnel.
0,"His concentration gone, the snow holding the princess crumbled."
0,The princess blew the human away from her with a great gust of wind that launched her to the side.
0,She barely avoided the blow from the charging giant and was now free to fight back.
0,Eydis breathed a sigh of relief.
0,“I had hoped it would not come to this.” The dwarf protected himself from the destruction of the ice wall with a shield fashioned of ice.
0,“You chose to protect the princess?
0,I must say that surprises me.
0,"If she survives, you cannot replace her.”"
0,Eydis swung both her arms to release two offensive barriers at the dwarf.
0,He was the leader and could not be taken lightly.
0,The snow shifted under the dwarf and moved him at an incredible speed out of the way of the barriers.
0,Frost coated both his arms until they froze solid.
0,The shield in his left hand grew in thickness and size.
0,"In his right hand, a large war hammer formed."
0,"Icicles covered the face of the hammer, and the back bore a single large spike."
0,The entire hammer radiated frost that chilled the air around it.
0,“I must admit that I half expected this to happen.
0,Jethro did warn me you might cross us.
0,My only question is why you sent her to us.
0,You could have sent her anywhere.
0,You even threatened as such.”
0,Eydis glanced in the princess’s direction.
0,The human with the sword lay motionless on the ground.
0,“Why hinder us?
0,"You could let us kill her and then remove her,” the dwarf continued."
0,"“I have no obligation to explain myself to you,” Eydis replied flatly."
0,"The dwarf was clearly stalling for time, and she wouldn’t have it."
0,The dwarf’s mustache twitched.
0,“Of course… But it is a shame.
0,I wanted better for you who lived a lie your entire life.
0,Now you will never escape Jethro.
0,"But if that is your choice, there is nothing more I can do.”"
0,"The snow at the feet of the dwarf propelled him in an S curve towards Eydis, his feet almost skidding across the surface as a tail of powder shot out behind him."
0,"His speed was far quicker than Eydis could run, even as a Lurr."
0,She barely managed to dodge when the strike of the war hammer hit at her feet.
0,Shards of ice sprayed upward from the impact.
0,One grazed the left side of Eydis’s hip and another cut across her right forearm.
0,The wounds frosted over and numbed her skin and muscles.
0,Shivers ran through Eydis’s body from the sudden drop in her body temperature.
0,"She rapidly increased her metabolic rate with life ven to heat her body, making her feverish."
0,"The frost thawed, but doing so took a large toll on her ven."
0,She would not be able to keep that up for long.
0,She needed to avoid being hit again.
0,The dwarf slid on the surface of the snow in a large arch for his next approach.
0,He skimmed near but not over a patch of thin snow.
0,This did not go unnoticed by Eydis.
0,She readied wind magic in her hands and planted her feet solid on the ground.
0,She blasted a torrent of wind at the snow in front of the dwarf.
0,The snow blew away in all directions.
0,"When the dwarf hit the bare patch of dead grass and dirt, he stumbled forward but caught himself on the ice shield and continued sliding towards Eydis on top of it."
0,He raised his hammer and slammed it on the ground.
0,"Eydis jumped back and prepared to defend against the spray of ice shards, but a concussion wave of frost replaced the explosion of shards and coated the ground in ice, completely covering the area Eydis cleared."
0,Of course he would have prepared for such a strategy.
0,Eydis landed on the slick ice and struggled to stay standing.
0,The dwarf rolled off his shield back to his feet and continued sliding on the ice.
0,He had to have used a lot of ven to maintain his assault.
0,He was only a race of human.
0,His ven capacity should be small.
0,"If Eydis could outlast him, forcing him into a physical battle, then she would have a chance."
0,"In a contest of strength, a dwarf could never beat a Lurr."
0,"In the corner of her eye, Eydis saw the princess get blown back by a strike of the giant."
0,"Her barrier took the brunt of the hit, but the force sent her bouncing and sliding along the ground."
0,"The minum had been killed, but the duo of the human’s explosive fire magic and the giant’s pure strength overpowered the princess in her tired and weakened state."
0,Eydis did not have the option of drawing out her battle with the dwarf.
0,The princess would be killed if she did not hurry.
0,But how could she beat a combat magic expert?
0,The reality that Eydis had never received combat training dug deep into her mind.
0,"She figuratively shook away the worrisome thoughts that would only cause her to hesitate, but even that delayed her reaction when she needed quick thinking most."
0,Eydis swung an offensive barrier in panic to stop the sudden strike from the war hammer.
0,The dwarf’s shield caught the barrier and broke.
0,What little sharpness remained barely cut into his arm.
0,"The hammer struck the ground at Eydis’s feet unobstructed as he passed, sending a spray of ice shrapnel."
0,"She erected a quick barrier, but some of the shards already passed and powdered her body leaving cuts and punctures through her clothes."
0,She screamed in agony as the chill of death sent painful and uncontrollable shivers throughout her body.
0,"Had she not created a barrier and the whole of the shards hit, the attack would have been instantly fatal."
0,It would have already been fatal if she was not a Lurr.
0,Eydis collapsed to the ground barely able to move.
0,Sparing a glance at the princess and the hesitation that followed had been a critical mistake.
0,She surged life magic through her body to heat herself but was unable to warm up in time to dodge the next hit.
0,"In desperation, she erected a barrier in front of her."
0,"The dwarf collided into it with enough force from his reformed shield to shatter the barrier, but his momentum was lost, and he was unable to swing his hammer."
0,He sped past Eydis to ready another approach.
0,Eydis opened and closed her hands.
0,"Feeling started to return to her body, but her ven was running low."
0,Eydis struggled to her feet and faced the approaching dwarf.
0,"She could barely stand, and every movement of her frozen joints felt like they would snap."
0,"She had an idea, but she would have to take the full brunt of the next attack and trust her Lurr resilience to be able to absorb the blow and resist the ice."
0,The dwarf charged with shield forward and hammer extended backward.
0,He raised it for a final strike against the shivering elf.
0,"Right as the hammer fell, Eydis dove into the shield."
0,A deathly chill shot straight through her body.
0,The dwarf’s momentum kept her pressed against the shield.
0,She clung on with her right arm and grabbed the dwarf’s neck through his armor with her left hand.
0,A contest of whether Eydis would freeze to death or the life magic would stop the dwarf’s heart began.
0,The dwarf realized Eydis’s intention and flung her off.
0,Eydis tumbled over the snow with the shield frozen to her chest.
0,He struggled to keep upright but collapsed.
0,The damage had been done.
0,Nothing was more lethal than the life element that included death magic.
0,Eydis stumbled over her frozen legs towards the fallen dwarf.
0,"She tore the shield off her chest, taking the front of her shirt and a layer of frozen skin with it."
0,The dwarf looked up at Eydis with clouded eyes.
0,He was still alive but barely.
0,“Can I have your name?” Eydis asked.
0,"“Mordok,” the dwarf barely managed to speak."
0,"“You fought well, Mordok."
0,Die proud.”
0,"Of all the human breeds, the dwarves were the most honorable."
0,Eydis could not find it within herself to fully hate him.
0,"He offered her every chance to take the easy path, the safe path, and leave with Rynn."
0,"For a human, he was caring in his own way."
0,Mordok smiled and then grew still.
0,"Using what remaining ven she could spare, Eydis attempted to heat her body and prepared to help the princess."
0,"For the rest of the fight, magic was no longer an option."
0,She had to save what ven remained.
1,Eydis charged towards the princess who was now on her back desperately trying to hold a barrier against the giant’s merciless onslaught.
0,The fire mage stood at a distance and sent explosive fireball after fireball without regard to the safety of the giant.
0,"The giant’s clothes smoldered, and black burns dotted his exposed back and arms."
0,The human had to die first.
0,"Eydis ran at him, forcing her frozen legs to move faster and faster."
0,"The movement helped warm her, but she was nowhere near as fast as she had been before."
0,A swift strike would not be possible.
0,The human noticed her approach and threw a fireball.
0,Eydis dodged it and was propelled forward by the force of the explosion behind her.
0,She landed in a roll that was more a controlled tumble and continued charging.
0,"At her distance now, an explosion would be just as harmful to him as it would be to her."
0,She was close enough to be safe.
0,Or so she thought.
0,The human threw a fireball at his feet when Eydis reached him.
0,The explosion blew her back and sent her bouncing over the ground.
0,"Luckily, the worst of the damage was minor burns on her chest, arms, and face."
0,"Her woven cap prevented her hair from burning, but the threads smoldered."
0,A human torch ran out of the explosion towards Eydis.
0,"As the fire cleared, the human kept fire coating his hands and feet."
0,He was completely unharmed from his explosion.
0,He had full-body heat resistance.
0,The first strike of his fist peppered small explosions through the air.
0,He jabbed once and then twice.
0,Each time fire exploded from his knuckles.
0,He had only been keeping his distance from the giant.
0,He appeared far more comfortable in a melee.
0,"Eydis, with her lack of any combat training, had to rely completely on her Lurr reflexes."
0,Each jab barely missed.
0,He forced Eydis into defense and was not giving her an opportunity to counterattack.
0,At least the heat helped her numbed body.
0,"Strike after strike, Eydis found her body moving better and better."
0,Mordok’s ice magic was far more dangerous.
0,"If anything, this human was helping her recover from her previous fight."
0,The human pivoted on his foot and kicked.
0,Eydis ducked under it and sprung at the human.
0,He arched backwards with his circular momentum as Eydis dove over him.
0,"With his hands planted on the ground, he spun his legs above him and nailed Eydis with the arch of fire they expelled."
0,Eydis rolled in the snow to smother the flames and returned to her feet.
0,"The human readied a fireball, so Eydis charged again."
0,She could not risk distancing herself.
0,She swung her hand full force.
0,"The human quenched his fireball and attempted to block her, but this proved a fatal mistake."
0,He was not fighting a normal elf.
0,"Her hand blew right through his forearm, shattering bone and sending a spray of blood along its path."
0,“GHHAAAA!”
0,The human reeled back in pain.
0,"Eydis exploited the opening to punch him in the stomach, embedding her fist inside of him."
0,Strong heat radiated from the deep wound.
0,"Eydis tried retracting her fist, but the human wrapped himself on her arm."
0,"He looked at her with furious eyes and smiled with a seeping, bloody grin."
0,"The heat increased enough to burn her hand, and soon the rest of his body began to smoke."
0,Panic set in.
0,"Eydis lifted the man and slammed him into the ground, but he would not release his grip."
0,"His skin grew red, and his clothes caught fire."
0,"In desperation, Eydis ran and scraped him across the ground."
0,She jumped and slammed him once and then again.
0,"With one final swing, the man lost consciousness and flew from her arm."
0,Eydis ran away as fast as she could.
0,A deafening explosion erupted from the body of the human sending a massive plume of fire and smoke into the air.
0,"Had Eydis been caught in the blast, she would have died instantly."
0,There was no doubt in her mind.
0,She looked up at the plume with quivering jaw.
0,All her planning and all her struggle was almost reduced to a pitiful burnt husk by a human fire mage.
0,That was the difference of experience.
0,"Eydis was far more powerful, but he was far more skilled."
0,I must hurry.
0,"The smoke would alert those in the city, if they had not already noticed the battle."
0,Someone would arrive before long.
1,Eydis charged across the snow at full speed towards the giant.
0,She was no longer frozen and could make use of her speed.
0,Every bit of strength she could muster went into the fist she flung mid charge at the giant’s back.
0,The giant swung his arm wide as if he knew Eydis was there.
0,"It collided with her side, sending her flying over fifty yards back through the air."
0,"Eydis crumpled onto the ground, bouncing over the dirty snow, and then slid over the ice Mordok created."
0,She finally stopped near the house.
0,"Her breath was gone, and she could feel acute pain in her ribs."
0,The blow was stronger than the Alukah’s.
0,Pooled blood vomited out her mouth.
0,Her body shook.
0,It screamed in writhing agony.
0,What magic had the giant used to become this strong?
0,How did the princess hold off against such strength for so long?
0,"Even now, the princess lay on her back futilely erecting barrier after barrier to block each strike from the giant, unable to manage anything else."
0,Eydis rolled to her torn knees and spat out the remaining blood.
0,She could not target the giant.
0,She needed to free the princess.
1,"Step by step, she forced her shaking legs to trudge towards the giant."
0,"With each step, she picked up speed."
0,"Instead of running directly at the giant’s back like before, she curved a large arch to the giant’s side and dove."
0,"The giant’s fists swung down, but they hit nothing but earth."
0,Eydis rolled over the snow with the princess in her arms and collided with the wire fence bordering the back of the property.
0,"Two of the wires snapped from the force of the impact, but the barbed metal only scraped her resilient skin."
0,She pulled the princess to her feet.
0,The giant stood in fuming anger at the loss of his target.
0,“EEEYYDISSSS!”
0,His eyes glowed deep crimson.
0,A Lurr.
0,"Lurr were naturally powerful, but giants also excelled physically."
0,A Lurr giant would only multiply that natural strength.
0,“We must flee.
0,"We cannot defeat him,” Eydis begged."
0,The princess struggled to stand.
0,"She placed her hand on Eydis’s shoulder, speaking through haggard breaths."
0,“No… We cannot let a monster… like that… remain in this world…”
0,A monster.
0,Of course.
0,The princess’s words cut another deep wound in Eydis’s heart.
0,"“I can no longer use magic, and you cannot contest it physically."
0,"If I hold it off, can you finish it?”"
0,"“I can try, but my ven is low."
0,"I will only get one chance,” the princess warned."
0,"The Lurr charged, and Eydis ran to meet him."
0,He readied his shoulder to tackle past Eydis to reach the princess.
0,She slid down on the snow and caught the Lurr’s leg in her armpit.
0,"As she thought, the Lurr was also lighter in this world."
0,Her momentum tripped him.
0,She hooked her arms around his leg and spun him three times before releasing.
0,"The Lurr flew back and tumbled across the snow, slid over the ice, and collided with the back wall of the house."
0,The princess channeled wind into her hands.
0,It condensed and swirled so heavy that it became visible.
0,"Seeing this, Eydis ran after the Lurr to keep him as far from the princess as possible to give her time to channel her attack."
0,The Lurr only had time to stand before Eydis lunged into him feet first.
0,She kicked out on impact and sent him crashing through the back wall into the kitchen.
0,The kick sent a painful shock up through Eydis’s body that wouldn’t subside.
0,Her body shook and her breath fell heavy.
0,"Her lungs burned from pushing them far past what they were willing to give in the thin air, and she struggled to stand."
0,“Foolish woman.”
0,"Eydis barely had time to brace herself before the hardwood table collided with her, blowing her back over the ice."
0,"When she hit snow, friction caught her, and the force of the table knocked out what little wind remained in her lungs."
0,It rolled over her and left her motionless on her back.
0,Ice crunched under each of the Lurr’s steps.
0,"He stood over her, completely unharmed from her attacks."
0,His thick fingers wrapped around her ankle and lifted her up.
0,She floated above him and then flew down into the ground with incredible force.
0,Snow and dirt blew out in every direction.
0,The Lurr lifted her and slammed her again into the ground.
0,"The woven cap flew off, releasing her bound golden hair."
0,Eydis felt her leg dislocate.
0,Blood rushed to her head and seeped from her eyes.
0,She was going to die.
0,"When the Lurr lifted her again, she swung her hand at his wrist."
0,"The weak barrier was not strong enough to cut through, but it severed a tendon or two."
0,The surprise of the sudden injury forced the giant to release his grip on the downward swing.
0,Eydis flew through the air.
0,"The world spun around her in a nauseating blur of black, white, and dark blue with thin, spiraling strings of light from the city."
0,The impact was not as strong as Eydis expected.
0,She flew high but not far.
0,The princess stood only a short distance away.
0,"The small ball of wind energy had grown to a swirling torrent that engulfed the princess’s entire body, but she continued channeling."
0,Eydis looked behind her at the Lurr.
0,He noticed the princess’s magic as well and grew cautious.
0,The princess glanced down at Eydis.
0,“Do not let him run.”
0,What more do you expect of me!
0,Eydis suppressed her cry of protest and fought her body to stand.
0,"When she thought she was steady, her dislocated leg gave in, sending her to the ground."
0,She bit her inner cheek until it drew blood.
0,"Grabbing her leg, she felt the socket and forced her leg back into place with an audible pop."
0,Tears grew in her eyes.
0,She cursed the princess with every burning nerve in her body.
0,She would not hold out much longer.
0,Even Lurr had their limits.
1,Eydis stumbled over the snow after the Lurr giant.
0,"He retrieved the table and split it lengthwise in half, holding a piece in each hand."
0,One half of the table swung horizontally at Eydis.
0,She barely had time to duck.
0,"The thick wood was heavy enough that if it hit her, it would blow her head clean off."
0,The second half of the table swung down.
0,"It slammed into the ground a mere hair’s width from Eydis’s face, the upheaved earth wrenching her neck to the side."
0,"The Lurr continued swinging the halves of the table as freely as if they were twigs, using the weight of one to counterbalance the weight of the other."
0,The dance continued without giving Eydis a chance to breathe.
0,A sudden trip or slow reaction would end her life in an instant.
0,"One half of the table swung widthwise, giving Eydis no room to duck."
0,It collided with her shoulder and sent her into the ground.
0,The next table came down.
0,Eydis rolled to the side.
0,The corner of the table dug into the ground where her head was just a moment before with enough force to fracture the thick wood and send splinters flying.
0,"Eydis kicked the center of the table, splitting it and knocking it out of the giant’s injured hand."
0,The next half of the table followed immediately after.
0,The Lurr swung it down flat making it impossible for her to dodge out the way in what narrow window of opportunity that might have been there.
0,"She braced against it with her arms and legs, and the impact caused the joints in her elbows and knees to pop."
0,The Lurr added his weight to try and crush her.
0,“Fool.” This world made the giant far lighter.
0,"If Eydis was a normal High Elf, she would have been in danger, but for a Lurr, the weight of a giant and table was easy enough to bear."
0,The princess watched on the side of their fight.
0,She finished charging and only waited for Eydis to signal when to strike.
0,Eydis acted as if the table was crushing her to keep the attention of the Lurr and shifted her leg to the side.
0,"Bracing the table with only one leg and arm, she placed her elbow on the ground and kicked off."
0,The table flew up and the Lurr to the side.
0,"“Now!” Eydis dove away, but not fast enough."
0,The Lurr grabbed her leg and held her out in front.
0,A strong wind blew her direction.
0,The princess either could not or did not want to stop her attack.
0,Eydis’s chest pounded to bursting.
0,She had to escape.
0,The wind became painful.
0,She could almost feel the skin of her chest peeling.
0,This was no time to reserve ven.
0,Eydis grabbed the Lurr’s wrist and pulled all the ven she could from her tired and broken body to convert it into a weak and simple life magic spell.
0,The Lurr’s arm numbed and released her.
0,She dove to the side as a deafening roar blew past her.
0,The torrent of wind knocked Eydis into a tumble further away.
0,The Lurr stood at the center of the horizontal funnel.
0,"The wind threatened to blow him back, so Eydis locked a barrier around his feet with the last dregs of what ven her body would give."
0,"It was weak, but it held the Lurr’s disproportionately light body."
0,"She held it as the fever and shivers of ven exhaustion set in, and she desperately fought to keep conscious."
0,"The Lurr shielded his face, unable to move, but his arms were no more effective than parchment against a sword."
0,Hundreds of blades of wind cut into the Lurr.
0,"The barrage chewed at his arms, legs, and torso."
0,"Behind him, a misty spray of gore blew out as clothes, flesh, and eventually bone was torn away."
0,The open carcass devoid of any flesh or organs soon disintegrated along with her barrier inside the funnel leaving nothing.
0,Only a long trench remained following the path of the wind extending out from the princess.
0,Tears fell from Eydis’s eyes.
0,She was almost caught in that blast.
0,"The princess did not hold back, fully ready to end her life along with the Lurr."
0,"Unable to bear the horror and pain any longer, Eydis collapsed to the ground and cried."
0,"Chapter 23
“The Crossroads of Happiness and Misery”
Eydis"
1,The wind leaving Eydis’s hand ebbed as the prepared ven ran out.
0,"She had never attempted magic of this magnitude, and it left her physically exhausted."
0,"She gasped for breath, unable to find enough air to supplement the cost of ven conversion."
0,Lightheadedness dropped her to her knees.
0,It was then that she noticed the badly injured woman on the ground not far from her.
0,The High Elf exhibited incredible physical prowess.
0,"When she called for her to attack, Eydis trusted that she would be out of the way."
0,The amount of wind circling her blurred her vision of anything in front save the vague silhouette of the large monster.
0,"She feared that the woman had gotten caught in the blast, but relief washed over her seeing that the woman survived."
0,Eydis struggled to stand and walked to where the woman collapsed.
0,"She was crying silently, and Eydis feared that her injuries were severe."
0,"She lifted her to sit back and began mending the fractured bones, ruptured organs, and countless wounds all over her body."
0,This woman had taken far more damage than she had in her efforts to save her life.
0,Eydis wondered how she was still alive.
0,Such severe injuries would have killed Eydis.
0,She could never repay such a debt.
0,“Thank you… Thank you for saving me.”
0,"Now that Eydis had the opportunity to look at her at length, the woman seemed very familiar."
0,"She had blood and dirt all over her face, and her chest was badly torn from the fight, but there was no mistaking what she saw."
0,This woman looked identical to her.
0,"The longer Eydis’s hands touched the woman, the more she felt a weak syphon of ven, different from the drain of the life magic she was using."
0,This explained the woman’s strength.
0,"As Eydis traced her hand over the woman’s chest to repair the damage and regrow the skin, she mustered up the courage to speak the question in her mind."
0,“You… you are a Lurr.
0,Who are you?”
0,The woman’s shaking hands grabbed Eydis’s arm.
0,She looked into her eyes and fought to stifle her tears.
0,“I am Eydis FeAmel.
0,I am sure you know what I mean.”
0,"For the past year, Eydis had supplied blood at the command of her father for the creation of her first body double."
0,"Although she provided for its growth, she never met it personally."
0,"Her father forbade it, citing the dangers should they ever meet."
0,"“You are my double, the doppelganger I created.”"
0,The doppelganger nodded.
0,“Why are you here?”
0,“To find you.” 
0,The doppelganger placed her hand on Eydis’s shoulder and pulled herself to her feet before Eydis could finish healing the surface wounds.
0,"In Eydis’s lack of usable ven, she was unable to heal the more delicate internal wounds."
0,“You shouldn’t move.
0,Your injuries will worsen.” 
0,The doppelganger’s gait was unstable.
0,Eydis braced her until she finished wiping her tears and found footing.
0,"Sirens blared in the distance, and Eydis looked in the sound’s direction."
0,“The police are coming.”
0,"“Before these police arrive, we must set fire to the house."
0,We need to prevent Jethro from using it again.”
0,"“Burning the house down will not stop a portal from forming,” Eydis tried to explain."
0,"“No, but drawing as much attention to this place as possible will prevent him from using it."
0,He wants to stay hidden.”
0,"The doppelganger grabbed Eydis’s wrist and pulled her over to the house, nearly tripping in the snow several times due to her trembling legs."
1,They entered from the collapsed wall.
0,“I do not know much about the humans of this world.
0,"If there is something you can use to set the house ablaze, do it."
0,I will try to find the trace of their portal back to Whinhlem.
0,I have no means to send you back to Amel otherwise.”
0,Eydis’s heart sank in her chest.
0,“Go back?” The shock of that simple phrase completely overshadowed all else her doppelganger had said.
0,"It spun in her mind, forcing away any emerging thoughts on how a portal trace was left at the source, not the destination, meaning that the doppelganger had no means to even bring her back to Whinhlem, or if the doppelganger even knew this about portal traces."
0,She gazed back out the large hole in the kitchen wall.
0,Smoke rose from burnt soil at the center of the explosion’s crater in the field.
0,Her own attack left a deep and long scar in the ground.
0,The snow across the field was died red and shimmered in the moonlight and umber glow of the crater.
0,And the many bodies of her enemies littered the ground.
0,"The assassin who sought her life, Jethro, knew where she was."
0,"She was fortunate this time, but if Tolmyur attacked her with Justin or Sammy present, she could not bear the thought of them getting hurt or worse."
0,Memories of her nightmare early that morning sent shivers down her spine.
0,"She could not bear Chloe getting hurt, or Miriam, or Sean, or any of the other humans of this world."
0,They were not part of this conflict.
0,They lived peaceful lives in this peaceful city.
0,Could she bring war to Gullivan?
0,Could she willingly endanger this world?
0,She would only bring them harm if she stayed.
0,Eydis did as her doppelganger asked.
0,She grabbed a cushion from the living room and brought it to the stove to light on the gas flames.
0,She caught the cupboards of the kitchen on fire.
0,"Back in the living room, she set the upholstery on fire, then the curtains."
0,The fire alarm cried out an ear-splitting howl.
0,"Next, she carried the cushion down the hall to the study and set the bookshelf ablaze."
0,The room filled with black smoke.
0,Another fire alarm joined the chorus.
0,Eydis felt this sufficient to burn the house down.
0,Eydis used weak wind magic to keep the air near her mouth clear and moved down the hall to the single bedroom where two dead soldiers lay.
0,"They were severed cleanly in half, far too clean to be the work of a blade."
0,The memory of Eydis’s twin brothers laying in their own gore returned and dominated her thoughts.
0,"A sharp pain pierced her heart, and the drowning sensations of anxiety sank the nauseating ache into her stomach."
0,Eydis felt sick.
0,She felt worse than the entire preceding fight against Tolmyur’s assassins.
0,Go back?
0,The doppelganger’s words repeated over and over in Eydis’s head.
0,Go back?
0,"What awaited her back on Whinhlem, back in Amel?"
0,Her family was dead.
0,Everyone she loved was dead.
0,Only turmoil awaited her there.
0,"Surely the Royal Council was preparing for war with Tolmyur, and she alone would be left to lead it as Empress Eydis Amel."
0,"Duty, impossible expectations--she wanted none of that, not after tasting the happiness that Justin and Sammy had provided for her here."
0,"This was her home now, not Whinhlem, not Amel, but a humble apartment along the river in Gullivan."
0,What about Tolmyur?
0,They now knew she was in Gullivan.
0,Her presence was a danger to everyone.
0,"However, this world had technology that Tolmyur could never match."
0,"Dr. Shuman was ready to contact the police at the first sure evidence of a Tolmyurin threat, and was this not such a case?"
0,"Now that she knew Tolmyur had access to this world, her returning to Whinhlem did not guarantee the safety of those here in Gullivan."
0,She could stop hiding and be upfront about who she was.
0,"The police, and possibly the military, could help."
0,"Surely, Tolmyur had no chance against them."
0,The Royal Council could handle the Amelian Empire.
0,"Even without the royal family, the Amelian Empire could still function as a confederation."
0,She could still do her part without losing her new life with Justin and Sammy by fighting Tolmyur should they inevitably appear here again.
0,Eydis’s anxiety slowly started to ebb as she justified her reasons to stay.
0,"Regret and guilt still gripped her heart, but she felt that after tasting such happiness here, she would break before ever being of use back in Amel should she return."
0,She fought through the smoke to look for her doppelganger to tell her the plan.
0,Something felt off.
0,Eydis had been all through the small house but did not see the doppelganger.
0,"“E… Eydis?” she called, feeling slightly awkward calling her own name."
0,A blow to the back of her head brought blackness.
1,Eydis fell limp into the arms of Eydis.
0,Eydis lifted a small knife she retrieved from the kitchen and stabbed it into the shoulder of the unconscious elf.
0,Crimson blood flowed freely from the wound.
0,The attack was unintended.
0,"She had not planned to prey on the princess, especially not before having a heart-to-heart discussion with her."
0,"But the princess was unguarded, vulnerable, and weak from the fight."
0,She had lied about searching for the nonexistant portal trace.
0,"She had to separate from the princess, to hide and resist."
0,"In Eydis’s ven-starved and injured state, the Lurr urges she had been suppressing for many days broke through."
0,Eydis placed her mouth over the puncture and sucked.
0,A feeling unlike anything she had ever felt filled her body.
0,A nostalgic flavor that caused an uncontrollable high danced in her mouth.
0,It was succulent.
0,It was energizing.
0,"In the smoke-clouded bedroom mirror, she saw the faint pink tint of her skin fade to a lighter, natural elven color."
0,"Her body felt full, free."
0,It was as if she had been sick all this time.
0,She had unknowingly been going through withdrawals and only now began feeling normal again.
0,She could feel her ven returning at a staggering pace.
0,She could feel her body changing.
0,The pure euphoria made her want to laugh.
0,It made her want to cry.
0,"At long last, Eydis had her prey."
0,Eydis’s conditioning snapped her back to consciousness.
0,"Her training took over, fueled by the life-threatening encounter against the Tolmyur soldiers just moments before."
0,Her doppelganger was on the ground in less than a second.
0,"However, her opponent was no simple elf."
0,Her doppelganger dodged the wind spear Eydis had subconsciously conjured to impale the imminent threat to the floor.
0,Eydis ran out the gaping hole in the wall.
0,"The sudden exertion left her light-headed, and she almost collapsed to the ground."
0,She felt deathly cold.
0,"Her shoulder bled, so she stemmed the bleeding with life magic."
0,"She was foolish, so foolish."
0,She had ignored her father’s warnings about the danger of a doppelganger because her doppelganger saved her from her assassins.
0,But that thought was wrong.
0,She wasn’t being saved.
0,"The doppelganger was a Lurr, a monster, and she was its sole prey."
0,The doppelganger was merely taking back its prey.
0,Eydis created a quick teleportation formula and tore open the portal the moment her doppelganger appeared from the smoking hole in the back wall.
0,"The portal had a simple destination, the mountains further from the city that she first saw from Dr. Shuman’s office window that day months ago."
0,She threw herself in as the police sirens blaring down the gravel road reached her ears.
0,She never heard her doppelgangers apology and plea for her to wait.
1,"The portal collapsed the moment Eydis exited, lacking the ven to keep it stable."
0,She landed hard on a rocky slope and tumbled over the rough stone until she landed in the cushioning snow drift beneath a pine tree.
0,The light of the city was not visible from her location.
0,She could barely see from what little light filtered through the boughs of the towering pines in the clear night.
0,"Eydis quickly readied life magic to regulate her body temperature, already dangerously low from her blood loss, but a quick flash of light appeared at the location her portal had collapsed."
0,There stood her doppelganger.
0,Eydis had only seen a teleportation formula trace read so quickly once before.
0,She made the connection to the two soldiers who were killed so cleanly back in the house.
0,Only one person was capable of these feats and could teach her doppelganger.
0,"“You… you sided with Jethro, with the humans.”"
0,"Her doppelganger’s once apologetic eyes now glowed red, faintly tinting the dark."
0,"What chance of understanding that might have remained vanished, replaced with fury."
0,“Who are you to judge what I had to do to survive!” She dove at Eydis.
0,"Eydis drew enough ven from her body’s critical reserves to expel a torrent of wind that blew her out of the snow drift and into shallower snow, but taking the ven her body needed to sustain itself worsened the sickening cold she felt."
0,Her body weakened further.
0,Her doppelganger was quick to respond and blew through the deep drift without effort.
0,"Before Eydis could recover, her doppelganger pounced on her, pinning her."
0,"Eydis disrupted her opponent’s balance with her legs and swapped positions, but that did not last for even a moment."
0,The difference in power was too great.
0,"She could never hope to compete against a Lurr, even an injured Lurr, as weakened as she was now."
0,The doppelganger was on top once again pinning her even tighter.
0,“I sided with the humans?” the doppelganger roared.
0,“What about you?
0,Were you not living with them?
0,"Did you not find yourself a man among them, living in such ignorant bliss of the horrors that are happening to your own people?!”"
0,The doppelganger grabbed Eydis’s neck and squeezed.
0,"“Yes, I sided with them."
0,"I did everything I could to earn their trust so I could find you, so I could meet you."
0,I wanted to help you.
0,I wanted to work with you against them!
0,"But after what I saw as I observed you… You never spared a thought to your own people’s suffering,” the doppelganger growled."
0,You’re wrong!
0,"Eydis wanted to scream, but the powerful grip on her neck sealed her voice."
0,The doppelganger’s glowing eyes bored down on Eydis piercing her to her moral center.
0,"Shock grew on the doppelganger’s face, and her eyes slowly widened into a pained stare."
0,Her grip eased slightly on Eydis’s neck.
0,“You do not want to return.
0,You want to stay here…”
0,"“No, you are wrong!” Eydis pleaded with the little air she could glean, but the guilt of her decision back at the house gripped her heart tight."
0,"The doppelganger’s eyes burned the deepest of red in unrestrained fury, almost blinding in the dark."
0,Her grip tightened on Eydis’s neck once again.
0,“LIES!
0,You just lied!
0,You want to abandon your people?
0,For these HUMANS?!” 
0,Angry tears budded in the corners of the doppelganger’s eyes.
0,“Are you not the heir of Amel?
0,Your duty is to lead your people.
0,To PROTECT them!”
0,The doppelganger’s jaw quivered.
0,The budding tears dripped onto Eydis’s face.
0,“I did not have to save you.
0,Jethro wants your body to present to your people.
0,I could give you to him.
0,"But, you do not deserve a martyr’s death."
0,You are not their princess.
0,You are NOT their empress!”
0,The doppelganger licked her lips.
0,"“Just as you created me to be a tool for your survival, your only use now will be a tool for my evolution."
0,You should be grateful that the people of your empire who suffer from Tolmyur’s occupation will never know of your cowardice… your betrayal.”
0,Eydis wrenched her prey’s neck to the side and bit into her shoulder.
0,She sucked the wound until no more blood followed.
0,She then bit again beside it to draw more.
0,"Instead of the euphoria she had felt when she first fed on her prey, now she only felt anger."
0,"She wanted to kill this fake princess who would have easily abandoned Rynn to suffering at the hands of Jethro and his men, but she forced herself to stop when she felt the body grow cold."
0,"If she continued, the fake princess would surely die."
0,She used her replenished ven to heal the wounds she inflicted and to stabilize the weakened body.
0,"After one last curse at Jethro and a promise that he would never win, she tore open a portal to the house where Rynn awaited her, the new Eydis FeAmel’s, triumphant return."
0,"To be continued in:
