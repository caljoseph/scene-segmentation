1,"BILLY WEAVER had traveled down from 
London on the slow afternoon train, with a 
change at Reading on the way, and by the time he 
got to Bath, it was about nine o’clock in the 
evening, and the moon was coming up out of a 
clear starry sky over the houses opposite the 
station entrance."
0,"But the air was deadly cold and 
the wind was like a flat blade of ice on his 
cheeks."
0,"“Excuse me,” he said, “but is there a fairly 
cheap hotel not too far away from here?”
"
0,"“Try The Bell and Dragon,” the porter 
answered, pointing down the road."
0,"“They might 
take you in."
0,"It’s about a quarter of a mile along 
on the other side.”
"
0,"Billy thanked him and picked up his suitcase 
and set out to walk the quarter-mile to The Bell 
and Dragon."
0,He had never been to Bath before.
0,He didn’t know anyone who lived there.
0,"But Mr. 
Greenslade at the head office in London had told 
him it was a splendid town."
0,"“Find your own 
lodgings,” he had said, “and then go along and 
report to the branch manager as soon as you’ve 
got yourself settled.”
"
0,Billy was seventeen years old.
0,"He was 
wearing a new navy-blue overcoat, a new brown 
trilby hat, and a new brown suit, and he was 
feeling fine."
0,He walked briskly down the street.
0,"He was trying to do everything briskly these 
days."
0,"Briskness, he had decided, was the one 
common characteristic of all successful 
businessmen."
0,"The big shots up at the head office 
were absolutely fantastically brisk all the time."
0,They were amazing.
0,"There were no shops on this wide street that 
he was walking along, only a line of tall houses 
on each side, all of them identical."
0,"They had 
porches and pillars and four or five steps going 
up to their front doors, and it was obvious that 
once upon a time they had been very swanky
residences."
0,"But now, even in the darkness, he 
could see that the paint was peeling from the 
woodwork on their doors and windows and that 
the handsome white facades were cracked and 
blotchy from neglect."
1,"Suddenly, in a downstairs window that was 
brilliantly illuminated by a street lamp not six 
yards away, Billy caught sight of a printed notice 
propped up against the glass in one of the upper 
panes."
0,It said BED AND BREAKFAST.
0,"There was a 
vase of yellow chrysanthemums, tall and 
beautiful, standing just underneath the notice."
0,He stopped walking.
0,He moved a bit closer.
0,"Green curtains (some sort of velvety material) 
were hanging down on either side of the 
window."
0,"The chrysanthemums looked wonderful 
beside them."
0,"He went right up and peered 
through the glass into the room, and the first 
thing he saw was a bright fire burning in the 
hearth."
0,"On the carpet in front of the fire, a pretty 
little dachshund was curled up asleep with its 
nose tucked into its belly."
0,"The room itself, so far 
as he could see in the half darkness, was filled 
with pleasant furniture."
0,"There was a baby grand 
piano and a big sofa and several  plump 
armchairs, and in one corner he spotted a large 
parrot in a cage."
0,"Animals were usually a good 
sign in a place like this, Billy told himself; and all 
in all, it looked to him as though it would be a 
pretty decent house to stay in."
0,"Certainly it would 
be more comfortable than The Bell and Dragon."
0,"On the other hand, a pub would be more 
congenial than a boardinghouse."
0,"There would 
be beer and darts in the evenings, and lots of 
people to talk to, and it would probably be a 
good bit cheaper, too."
0,"He had stayed a couple of 
nights in a pub once before and he had liked it."
0,"He had never stayed in any boardinghouses, and, 
to be perfectly honest, he was a tiny bit 
frightened of them."
0,"The name itself conjured up 
images of watery cabbage, rapacious landladies, 
and a powerful smell of kippers in the living 
room."
0,"After dithering about like this in the cold for 
two or three minutes, Billy decided that he 
would walk on and take a look at The Bell and 
Dragon before making up his mind."
0,"He turned to 
go."
0,And now a queer thing happened to him.
0,"He 
was in the act of stepping back and turning away 
from the window when all at once his eye was 
caught and held in the most peculiar manner by 
the small notice that was there."
0,"BED AND 
BREAKFAST, it said."
0,"BED AND BREAKFAST, BED 
AND BREAKFAST, BED AND BREAKFAST."
0,"Each 
word was like a large black eye staring at him 
through the glass, holding him, compelling him, 
forcing him to stay where he was and not to walk 
away from that house, and the next thing he 
knew, he was actually moving across from the 
window to the front door of the house, climbing 
the steps that led up to it, and reaching for the 
bell."
0,He pressed the bell.
0,"Far away in a back room 
he heard it ringing, and then at once —it must 
have been at once because he hadn’t even had 
time to take his finger from the bell button—the 
door swung open and a woman was standing 
there."
0,"Normally you ring the bell and you have at 
least a half-minute’s wait before the door opens."
0,But this dame was like a jack-in-the-box.
0,"He 
pressed the bell—and out she popped!"
0,"It made 
him jump."
0,"She was about forty-five or fifty years old, 
and the moment she saw him, she gave him a 
warm, welcoming smile."
0,"“Please come in,” she said pleasantly."
0,"She 
stepped aside, holding the door wide open, and 
Billy found himself automatically starting 
forward."
0,"The compulsion or, more accurately, 
the desire to follow after her into that house was 
extraordinarily strong."
0,"“I saw the notice in the window,” he said, 
holding himself back."
0,"“Yes, I know.”
"
0,“I was wondering about a room.”
0,"“It’s all ready for you, my dear,” she said."
0,"She 
had a round pink face and very gentle blue eyes."
0,"“I was on my way to The Bell and Dragon,” 
Billy told her."
0,"“But the notice in your window 
just happened to catch my eye.”


"
0,"“My dear boy,” she said, “why don’t you come 
in out of the cold?”"
0,“How much do you charge?”
0,"“Five and sixpence a night, including 
breakfast.”"
0,It was fantastically cheap.
0,"It was less than 
half of what he had been willing to pay."
0,"“If that is too much,” she added, “then 
perhaps I can reduce it just a tiny bit."
0,"Do you 
desire an egg for breakfast?"
0,"Eggs are expensive 
at the moment."
0,"It would be sixpence less without 
the egg.”
"
0,"“Five and sixpence is fine,” he answered."
0,"“I 
should like very much to stay here.”
"
0,“I knew you would.
0,"Do come in.”
"
0,She seemed terribly nice.
0,"She looked exactly 
like the mother of one’s best school friend 
welcoming one into the house to stay for the 
Christmas holidays."
1,"Billy took off his hat and 
stepped over the threshold."
0,"“Just hang it there,” she said, “and let me help 
you with your coat.”
"
0,There were no other hats or coats in the hall.
0,"There were no umbrellas, no walking sticks—
nothing."
0,"“We have it all to ourselves,” she said, smiling 
at him over her shoulder as she led the way 
upstairs."
0,"“You see, it isn’t very often I have the 
pleasure of taking a visitor into my little nest.”
"
0,"The old girl is slightly dotty, Billy told 
himself."
0,"But at five and sixpence a night, who 
cares about that?"
0,"“I should’ve thought you’d be 
simply swamped with applicants,” he said 
politely."
0,"“Oh, I am, my dear, I am, of course I am."
0,"But 
the trouble is that I’m inclined to be just a teenyweeny bit choosy and particular—if you see 
what I mean.”
"
0,"“Ah, yes.”"
0,“But I’m always ready.
0,"Everything is always 
ready day and night in this house just on the off 
chance that an acceptable young gentleman will 
come along."
0,"And it is such a pleasure, my dear, 
such a very great pleasure when now and again I 
open the door and I see someone standing there 
who is just exactly right.” "
0,"She was halfway up the 
stairs, and she paused with one hand on the stair 
rail, turning her head and smiling down at him 
with pale lips."
0,"“Like you,” she added, and her 
blue eyes traveled slowly all the way down the 
length of Billy’s body, to his feet, and then up 
again."
0,"On the second-floor landing she said to him, 
"
0,“This floor is mine.”
0,They climbed up another flight.
0,"“And this one 
is all yours,” she said."
0,“Here’s your room.
0,"I do 
hope you’ll like it.” "
0,"She took him into a small but 
charming front bedroom, switching on the light 
as she went in."
0,"“The morning sun comes right in the window, 
Mr. Perkins."
0,"It is Mr. Perkins, isn’t it?”
"
0,"“No,” he said."
0,"“It’s Weaver.”
"
0,“Mr. Weaver.
0,How nice.
0,"I’ve put a water 
bottle between the sheets to air them out, Mr. 
Weaver."
0,"It’s such a comfort to have a hot-water 
bottle in a strange bed with clean sheets, don’t 
you agree?"
0,"And you may light the gas fire at any 
time if you feel chilly.”
"
0,"“Thank you,” Billy said."
0,"“Thank you ever so 
much.” "
0,"He noticed that the bedspread had been 
taken off the bed and that the bedclothes had 
been neatly turned back on one side, all ready for 
someone to get in."
0,"“I’m so glad you appeared,” she said, looking 
earnestly into his face."
0,"“I was beginning to get 
worried.”
"
0,"“That’s all right,” Billy answered brightly."
0,“You mustn’t worry about me.” 
0,"He put his 
suitcase on the chair and started to open it."
0,"“And what about supper, my dear?"
0,"Did you 
manage to get anything to eat before you came 
here?”
"
0,"“I’m not a bit hungry, thank you,” he said."
0,"“I 
think I’ll just go to bed as soon as possible 
because tomorrow I’ve got to get up rather early 
and report to the office.”
"
0,"“Very well, then."
0,"I’ll leave you now so that 
you can unpack."
0,"But before you go to bed, would 
you be kind enough to pop into the sitting room 
on the ground floor and sign the book?"
0,"Everyone 
has to do that because it’s the law of the land, 
and we don’t want to go breaking any laws at 
this stage in the proceedings, do we?” "
0,"She gave 
him a little wave of the hand and went quickly 
out of the room and closed the door."
0,"Now, the fact that his landlady appeared to 
be slightly off her rocker didn’t worry Billy in the 
least."
0,"After all, she not only was harmless—there 
was no question about that—but she was also 
quite obviously a kind and generous soul."
0,"He 
guessed that she had probably lost a son in the 
war, or something like that, and had never gotten 
over it."
1,"So a few minutes later, after unpacking his 
suitcase and washing his hands, he trotted 
downstairs to the ground floor and entered the 
living room."
0,"His landlady wasn’t there, but the 
fire was glowing in the hearth, and the little 
dachshund was still sleeping soundly in front of 
it."
0,The room was wonderfully warm and cozy.
0,"I’m a lucky fellow, he thought, rubbing his hands."
0,This is a bit of all right.
0,"He found the guest book lying open on the 
piano, so he took out his pen and wrote down his 
name and address."
0,"There were only two other 
entries above his on the page, and as one always 
does with guest books, he started to read them."
0,One was a Christopher Mulholland from Cardiff.
0,The other was Gregory W. Temple from Bristol.
0,"That’s funny, he thought suddenly."
0,Christopher Mulholland.
0,It rings a bell.
0,"Now where on earth had he heard that rather 
unusual name before?"
0,Was it a boy at school?
0,No.
0,"Was it one of his 
sister’s numerous young men, perhaps, or a 
friend of his father’s?"
0,"No, no, it wasn’t any of 
those."
0,He glanced down again at the book.
0,"Christopher Mulholland
231 Cathedral Road, Cardiff
Gregory W. Temple
27 Sycamore Drive, Bristol
"
0,"As a matter of fact, now he came to think of it, 
he wasn’t at all sure that the second name didn’t 
have almost as much of a familiar ring about it as 
the first."
0,"“Gregory Temple?” he said aloud, searching 
his memory."
0,"“Christopher Mulholland?..."""
0,"
“Such charming boys,” a voice behind him 
answered, and he turned and saw his landlady 
sailing into the room with a large silver tea tray 
in her hands."
0,"She was holding it well out in front 
of her, and rather high up, as though the tray 
were a pair of reins on a frisky horse."
0,"“They sound somehow familiar,” he said."
0,“They do?
0,"How interesting.”
"
0,"“I’m almost positive I’ve heard those names 
before somewhere."
0,Isn’t that odd?
0,"Maybe it was 
in the newspapers."
0,"They weren’t famous in any 
way, were they?"
0,"I mean famous cricketers or 
footballers or something like that?”
"
0,"“Famous,” she said, setting the tea tray down 
on the low table in front of the sofa."
0,"“Oh no, I 
don’t think they were famous."
0,"But they were 
incredibly handsome, both of them, I can 
promise you that."
0,"They were tall and young and 
handsome, my dear, just exactly like you.”
"
0,"Once more, Billy glanced down at the book."
0,"“Look here,” he said, noticing the dates."
0,"“This last 
entry is over two years old.”
"
0,“It is?”
0,"“Yes, indeed."
0,"And Christopher Mulholland’s is 
nearly a year before that—more than three years 
ago.”
"
0,"“Dear me,” she said, shaking her head and 
heaving a dainty little sigh."
0,"“I would never have 
thought it."
0,"How time does fly away from us all, 
doesn’t it, Mr. Wilkins?”
"
0,"“It’s Weaver,” Billy said."
0,"“W-e-a-v-e-r.”
"
0,"“Oh, of course it is!” she cried, sitting down 
on the sofa."
0,“How silly of me.
0,I do apologize.
0,"In 
one ear and out the other, that’s me, Mr. 
Weaver.”
"
0,“You know something?” Billy said.
0,"“Something that’s really quite extraordinary 
about all this?”
"
0,"“No, dear, I don’t.”"
0,"“Well, you see, both of these names—
Mulholland and Temple—I not only seem to 
remember each one of them separately, so to 
speak, but somehow or other, in some peculiar 
way, they both appear to be sort of connected 
together as well."
0,"As though they were both 
famous for the same sort of thing, if you see what 
I mean—like... well... like Dempsey and 
Tunney, for example, or Churchill and 
Roosevelt.”"
0,"
“How amusing,” she said."
0,"“But come over 
here now, dear, and sit down beside me on the 
sofa and I’ll give you a nice cup of tea and a 
ginger biscuit before you go to bed.”
"
0,"“You really shouldn’t bother,” Billy said."
0,"“I 
didn’t mean you to do anything like that.” "
0,"He 
stood by the piano, watching her as she fussed 
about with the cups and saucers."
0,"He noticed that 
she had small, white, quickly moving hands and 
red fingernails."
0,"“I’m almost positive it was in the newspapers 
I saw them,” Billy said."
0,“I’ll think of it in a second.
0,"I’m sure I will.”
"
0,"There is nothing more tantalizing than a 
thing like this that lingers just outside the 
borders of one’s memory."
0,He hated to give up.
0,"“Now wait a minute,” he said."
0,"“Wait just a 
minute."
0,"Mulholland... Christopher Mulholland... wasn’t that the name of the Eton schoolboy who 
was on a walking tour through the West Country, 
and then all of a sudden..."""
0,"“And sugar?”
"
0,"“Yes, please."
0,"And then all of a sudden ..."""
0,"
“Eton schoolboy?” she said."
0,"“Oh no, my dear, 
that can’t possibly be right, because my Mr. 
Mulholland was certainly not an Eton schoolboy 
when he came to me."
0,"He was a Cambridge 
undergraduate."
0,"Come over here now and sit next 
to me and warm yourself in front of this lovely 
fire."
0,Come on.
0,Your tea’s all ready for you.” 
0,"She 
patted the empty place beside her on the sofa, 
and she sat there smiling at Billy and waiting for 
him to come over."
0,"He crossed the room slowly and sat down on 
the edge of the sofa."
0,"She placed his teacup on the 
table in front of him."
0,"“There we are,” she said."
0,"“How nice and cozy 
this is, isn’t it?”
"
0,Billy started sipping his tea.
0,She did the same.
0,"For half a minute or so, neither of them spoke."
0,But Billy knew that she was looking at him.
0,"Her 
body was half turned toward him, and he could 
feel her eyes resting on his face, watching him 
over the rim of her teacup."
0,"Now and again, he 
caught a whiff of a peculiar smell that seemed to 
emanate directly from her person."
0,"It was not in 
the least unpleasant, and it reminded him—well, 
he wasn’t quite sure what it reminded him of."
0,Pickled walnuts?
0,New leather?
0,"Or was it the 
corridors of a hospital?"
0,"At length, she said, “Mr. Mulholland was a 
great one for his tea."
0,"Never in my life have I seen 
anyone drink as much tea as dear, sweet Mr. 
Mulholland.”
"
0,"“I suppose he left fairly recently,” Billy said."
0,"He was still puzzling his head about the two 
names."
0,"He was positive now that he had seen 
them in the newspapers—in the headlines."
0,"“Left?” she said, arching her brows."
0,"“But my 
dear boy, he never left."
0,He’s still here.
0,"Mr. 
Temple is also here."
0,"They’re on the fourth floor, 
both of them together.”
"
0,"Billy set his cup down slowly on the table and 
stared at his landlady."
0,"She smiled back at him, 
and then she put out one of her white hands and 
patted him comfortingly on the knee."
0,"“How old 
are you, my dear?” she asked."
0,"“Seventeen.”
"
0,“Seventeen!” she cried.
0,"“Oh, it’s the perfect 
age!"
0,Mr. Mulholland was also seventeen.
0,"But I 
think he was a trifle shorter than you are; in fact 
I’m sure he was, and his teeth weren’t quite so 
white."
0,"You have the most beautiful teeth, Mr. 
Weaver, did you know that?”
"
0,"“They’re not as good as they look,” Billy said."
0,"“They’ve got simply masses of fillings in them at 
the back.”
"
0,"“Mr. Temple, of course, was a little older,” she 
said, ignoring his remark."
0,"“He was actually 
twenty-eight."
0,"And yet I never would have 
guessed it if he hadn’t told me, never in my 
whole life."
0,"There wasn’t a blemish on his body.”
"
0,“A what?” Billy said.
0,"“His skin was just like a baby’s.”
"
0,There was a pause.
0,"Billy picked up his teacup 
and took another sip of his tea; then he set it 
down again gently in its saucer."
0,"He waited for 
her to say something else, but she seemed to 
have lapsed into another of her silences."
0,"He sat 
there staring straight ahead of him into the far 
corner of the room, biting his lower lip."
0,"“That parrot,” he said at last."
0,"“You know 
something?"
0,"It had me completely fooled when I 
first saw it through the window."
0,"I could have 
sworn it was alive.”
"
0,"“Alas, no longer.”"
0,"“It’s most terribly clever the way it’s been 
done,” he said."
0,"“It doesn’t look in the least bit 
dead."
0,"Who did it?”
"
0,“I did.”
0,“You did?”
0,"“Of course,” she said."
0,"“And have you met my 
little Basil as well?” "
0,"She nodded toward the 
dachshund curled up so comfortably in front of 
the fire."
0,Billy looked at it.
0,"And suddenly, he 
realized that this animal had all the time been 
just as silent and motionless as the parrot."
0,"He put
out a hand and touched it gently on the top of its 
back."
0,"The back was hard and cold, and when he 
pushed the hair to one side with his fingers, he 
could see the skin underneath, grayish black and 
dry and perfectly preserved."
0,"“Good gracious me,” he said."
0,"“How absolutely 
fascinating.”"
0," He turned away from the dog and 
stared with deep admiration at the little woman 
beside him on the sofa."
0,"“It must be most awfully 
difficult to do a thing like that.”
"
0,"“Not in the least,” she said."
0,"“I stuff all my little 
pets myself when they pass away."
0,"Will you have 
another cup of tea?”
"
0,"“No, thank you,” Billy said."
0,"The tea tasted 
faintly of bitter almonds, and he didn’t much care 
for it."
0,"“You did sign the book, didn’t you?”
"
0,"“Oh, yes.”"
0,“That’s good.
0,"Because later on, if I happen to 
forget what you were called, then I could always 
come down here and look it up."
0,"I still do that 
almost every day with Mr. Mulholland and Mr. ... Mr. ..."""
0,"
“Temple,” Billy said, “Gregory Temple."
0,"Excuse 
my asking, but haven’t there been any other 
guests here except them in the last two or three 
years?”
"
0,"Holding her teacup high in one hand, 
inclining her head slightly to the left, she looked 
up at him out of the corners of her eyes and gave 
him another gentle little smile."
0,"“No, my dear,” she said."
0,“Only you.”
