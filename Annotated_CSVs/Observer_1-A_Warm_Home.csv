1,My vision blurred as I walked down a dirt path littered with leaves and darkened by the overhanging trees stretching out their branches to block the moonlight.
0,"I was tired, and my eyes yearned for a respite from the chill of the night wind blowing down the path I walked, but I marched forward, heading for the one relief I could see."
0,There was a faint wisp of an orange glow through the trees.
0,The winding forest path opened into a field of tall grass.
0,I could not help but pause for a moment to measure myself against the towering grass beside me.
0,"My height was not lacking compared to others my age, but I had to hand it to the grass, it was taller by a couple inches."
0,"I could not help but feel the grass stand erect, boasting its superiority."
0,Beyond the grass atop a hill sat a small cottage as if trying to hide itself among the grass.
0,"A hearty attempt, but the grass would need to grow much taller."
0,"In the window hung a small glass lamp, the light I had seen from the forest."
0,"Ignoring the pessimism telling me that they would reject me, an orphan, as well, I began weaving my way through the grass."
0,"The darkness of the towering grass, although somewhat lit by the teamwork of the crescent moon with its stars and the lamp in the window, had me walking near blind as I made my way to the hill."
0,My approach was hindered as my shin hit something hard which gave way with a dull crack.
0,"In front of me, hidden in the grass, was a wooden fence."
0,"It had long since rotted, the wood giving way and chipping as I pinched it between my thumb and forefinger."
0,"Not wanting to climb over the upper plank for fear of it breaking and doubting I would be able to fit between the two planks or underneath, I pushed the grass aside and followed it."
0,"The rotten fence circled the hill upon which the house stood, but there was no gate."
0,"After nearly circling the hill once, I was beginning to wonder if there was a way through the fence, that was until I found what seemed to be a small path in the grass."
0,"It was wide enough for only one person to walk, and even still, the grass brushed on each side."
0,"The path led away from the hill, but where it touched the fence both upper and lower planks had been broken, and it continued up the hill to the cottage."
0,"A smile crept across my face as I stepped over the trampled, rotting wood and followed the path up the hill to the back of the cottage."
1,The grass had been cleared near the door and to the right until it reached what looked like the cottage's cellar.
0,Inside the window the light of the lamp's glow from the other side of the cottage radiated inside.
0,"It looked empty, yet someone had to live there."
0,I rapped on the back door and waited.
0,Minutes passed and I repeated again.
0,After another wait I knocked louder.
0,I was only able to hit the door once more before it flung open.
0,"In front of me stood an elderly woman thin to an unhealthy extent, her paper skin wrapping tight around the joints of her hand as she held the door."
0,"She stood looking at me with surprise, and in her other hand protruded a large kitchen knife."
0,The elderly woman lowered it upon seeing me.
0,"""Heavens child, you scared me to death, knocking on the door so late at night."""
0,"Her voice crackled with a small rasp, but her tone was lighthearted."
0,"""Sorry to bother you,"" I apologized, ""but I was wondering if I could spend the night here."
0,"I'm not asking for anything but a roof over my head."""
0,The woman took a closer look at me.
0,Her eyes widened.
0,"""Come in, come in."""
1,"Once I was inside, the elderly lady stuck her head out the door and looked around before closing it."
0,"I expected her to set the latch, but she kept it open."
0,She then lit a candle and began prepping the fireplace.
0,I sat silent behind her until the scant timber lit.
0,The elderly woman stepped aside.
0,"""You'll want to get closer dear."
0,"I wish I could make it bigger but Alfred, my husband, would get mad."
0,"Tonight of all night is one we should not be lighting a fire."""
0,I did not question why as I moved to the mouth of the fireplace and placed my hands above the small flames.
0,"""I do wonder what's keeping him."""
0,The elderly woman sat back in a rocking chair that creaked at every subtle movement.
0,"""Ma'am,"" I began, but the elderly woman cut me off."
0,"""Call me Hazel, dear."""
0,"""Hazel, what is your husband doing so late at night?"""
0,"No sooner had I finished my question, than the back door swung open."
0,"An elderly man carrying a large burlap sack over his shoulder walked inside and closed the door, latching it."
0,"He set the sack, stained with blood, beside the door and looked at me as his eyebrows drew closer together."
0,He hobbled over to the window and put out the lantern.
0,"""Have you gone mad?"""
0,Alfred asked as he stood facing Hazel and I.
0,"His tone was not demeaning, but echoed concern."
0,"""A lantern and fire?"
0,"Who's the boy?"""
0,"""I was worried for you, so I set out the lantern to help you find your way back in the dark."
0,"This child saw it and found his way here."""
0,"""What if that had been the town guard?"
0,"Or anyone from the village?"""
0,"""I know, I know."""
0,"Hazel cracked a smile, showing she was not worried."
0,"""But you're usually back long before now."""
0,Hazel glanced over by door.
0,"""So small…"" her smile faded as she looked at me, then to Alfred."
0,"""They are starting to take notice again,"" Alfred replied."
0,"""I may not be able to hunt again until winter's over."""
0,"""So soon?"
0,"But will we be able to survive the winter on that?"""
0,"""What about the boy?"""
0,Alfred asked.
0,Hazel looked at me with concern.
0,I took this as my chance to speak up.
0,"""I'm terribly sorry to have shown up at such an unpleasant time."""
0,"""Sweet thing,"" Hazel exclaimed, ""So polite too."
0,"The way I see it, you are far worse off than we are."
0,"Here, let me grab you a blanket."
0,"That rag you are wearing it hardly fit to warm you up."""
0,Hazel walked off to a room in the back of the cottage.
0,"""Are you not supposed to hunt?"""
0,I asked Alfred.
0,"His eyebrow rose at the question, so I thought I should clarify."
0,"""You said that they, I guess the village, is starting to notice."""
0,"""I guess you could say what we do is illegal, hunting."""
0,Alfred stepped back and sat in a chair beside the fireplace.
0,"""Are you not from the village?"""
0,"""No, sir."""
0,"Relief flushed the old man's face, forcing away the tension that had been present from the moment he laid eyes on me."
0,Hazel returned with a thin quilt and requested that I hand her the cloth I had draped around me.
0,"As I stood and removed it, Hazel's hand rose to her mouth in surprise."
0,"""You poor thing."
0,Were you traveling with naught but that cloth around you?
0,"In this cold?"""
0,I looked down at my pale nakedness.
0,"As far back as I could remember, I had never owned any clothes of my own."
0,The cloth was only to save others the embarrassment.
0,"""Yes ma'am… Hazel,"" I corrected."
0,"""You'll catch your death of cold."""
0,"Hazel hurried over and wrapped the quilt over my shoulders and around me, rubbing the quilt around my arms and back to speed the warmth."
0,My hands clutched the fabric and pulled it in.
0,It was warm.
0,"""What are we going to do?"""
0,Hazel asked Alfred.
0,Alfred's eyes fell on the bag by the door.
0,"""We don't have much food."""
0,Hazel looked at him with worry in her eyes.
0,"Guilt weighed down on me, increased even more by the quilt I now had draped over my shoulders, but I could not bear the thought of another winter spent at the mercy of the elements."
0,I kneeled down on the floor and looked up at Alfred.
0,"""Sir, when I came, I requested a place to stay for the night, but my intentions were to find somewhere to stay for the winter."
0,All I want is the shelter.
0,You will not need to feed me.
0,I can make by on my own without food.
0,"I can even help work to make myself of worth to you."""
0,"""I don't know where you could find your own food around here."""
0,Alfred's eyes never left the bag.
0,"""But, the least we could do is make certain the cold didn't make you ill."
0,I'll give you a few days.
0,"We'll decide what to do from there."""
0,Alfred stood and walked over to the back door.
0,"""Hazel, I'll place the bag in the cellar for you to clean tomorrow."""
0,"""I can help if you like,"" I suggested."
0,"""No need,"" Alfred said without a moment's hesitation."
0,"""I hunt, and Hazel cleans the meat for storage."
0,It's the deal we've been honoring for decades.
0,"You should stay inside and keep yourself warm the best you can."""
0,"Alfred closed the door behind him, and Hazel handed me the thin cushion from her rocking chair."
0,"""Use this for a pillow."""
0,Hazel said.
0,"""I wish we had more to offer."""
0,"""You've given me more than enough."
0,"Thank you."""
0,"I set the cushion on the floor and lay down on my side in front of the fireplace, taking care to not let any part of me be exposed from inside the quilt."
0,"Tired from my travels, the moment my eyes closed I was asleep."
1,I awoke with a chill down my back.
0,"The quilt had somewhat dislodged itself from me leaving my back exposed, which was not unexpected due to my tendency to thrash about in my sleep."
0,Rubbing my eyes removed the scales and returned my vision from its sleep-drunken haze.
0,"In the fireplace, orange embers glowed amidst the ashes of the fire Hazel had built."
0,"The fire should have long since died, but it yet clung to life."
0,Beside the fire in the chair sat Alfred.
0,There was a small pile of timber at his feet and a stick clenched in his hand.
0,Alfred must have fallen asleep after he was too weak to fight it.
0,I removed the quilt and draped it over Alfred.
0,"Using the timber at his feet, I stoked the fire up to the size Hazel had it for me."
0,"It was small, but even a little heat would be better for him than none."
0,"It was still dark as I walked around the house, but the pale-blue glow through the window showed the sun would soon rise."
0,"My attempts to find a source for work to aid the elderly couple ended in vain due to how well kept the cottage was, at least on the inside."
1,That thought drew me to the back door.
0,I located my cloth and wrapped it around myself before heading outside.
0,I had noticed it before.
0,The cottage looked unlived in from the outside.
0,I followed close to the wall around to the front of the cottage.
0,There was a small covered porch that protruded about three feet from the front door and ran along the entirety of cottage's front.
0,"The wood seemed sturdy as I stood on it, but grass and weeds had grown through the cracks."
0,"A railing had been present at one time, but it sat broken both on the porch and off."
0,This was a good place to start.
0,I began by collecting the segments of the former railing and set them in a pile off the front of the porch.
0,"The weeds came next, which fought in vain as I removed them with ease from their holes between the boards."
0,"As the sun rose, I was able to see the village Alfred had mentioned about two miles away further downhill."
0,It sat in a valley carved by a river between two large hills.
0,"Much of the village was obscured from view, but this cottage was still visible."
0,I was starting to understand the danger of having a lamp lit and fire going on a night when you were poaching.
1,"As I finished uprooting the weeds and grass from the boards of the porch, a loud stir came from inside the cottage."
0,Panicked voices muffled through the cottage walls reached my ears.
0,I stood up and tapped on the front window.
0,Hazels face met me with relief from the other side.
0,"She opened the window, and a moment later, Alfred hobbled around the side of the cottage."
0,"""You scared us half to death, dear,"" Hazel said in a concerned tone."
0,"""Close the window,"" Alfred ordered."
0,"""You'll let the heat escape."
0,"Oh, and can you make the boy something warm to eat?"""
0,"Hazel complied, but only after handing me the quilt through the window."
0,"Before she could close it, I turned down their offer of a meal."
0,"""I told you that I don't need you to feed me."
0,"Thank you for the offer, but save your food."
0,"You'll need it for winter, right?"""
0,"""You sure dear?"""
0,Hazel asked.
0,"""I can't have you starving."""
0,"""I manage on my own,"" I repeated."
0,“I always have.”
0,"With my answer, Hazel closed the window."
0,"""What do you think you are doing, boy, out here this early?"""
0,Alfred asked as he lifted himself onto the porch.
0,"""Sorry to worry you."
0,And last night too.
0,"Thank you for keeping the fire lit."""
0,"""That doesn't explain why you are out here in the cold."
0,"I thought I told you we can't have you getting sick."""
0,"""I told you I'd work for my stay."
0,"This porch was in disrepair, so I thought I'd help."""
0,"""Thank you, but there is no need,"" Alfred said as he sat down beside me and leaned against the wall below the window."
0,"""You don't use it?"""
0,"""Did you see me come through that front door?"""
0,I shook my head.
0,"""I haven't been able to open it for over a decade."
0,"I think the wood expanded and the latch is rusted."""
0,I stood up and walked over to the door.
0,"""Is it locked on the inside?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""No,"" Alfred replied looking confused."
0,I placed my hand on the handle and gave the door a light tug.
0,It didn't budge.
0,"""I told you, it won't open."""
0,"My hands gripped the biting cold metal handle, and my foot braced against the wall."
0,I pulled slowly and the door inched outward.
0,Alfred was correct in saying the wood had expanded.
0,"As the door worked its way loose, splinters of wood chipped from the door and frame."
0,"Once the door was open, Hazel looked at me from the other side with wide eyes."
0,"""Has the door really grown so rotten?"""
0,Hazel asked.
0,"""How long has it been since you tried to open it?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""A couple years,"" Alfred replied while rubbing the back of his head."
0,"""If you are planning to work for your stay, I'd say that alone is worth a week as long as you're still planning on feeding yourself."""
0,"""Do you have a file, or a knife?"
0,"I can shave the door down for you to make it easier."""
0,"""I'm sure I have something like that in my cellar."
0,"That would be a great help, boy."""
0,Alfred stood up and hobbled off to the back of the cottage.
0,* * *
1,"After clearing  their front porch, at least to the extent that they could use it again, I began cutting the long grass around the cottage by hand due to their lack of adequate tools."
0,"In their old age, they were unable to maintain the grounds."
0,Alfred always insisted I stay inside.
0,"The colder it became, the more vehement he became."
0,It may have been because they could not provide any clothing--I had been working with the sole quilt as my covering--but I was just as adamant about helping them.
0,We came to an agreement that I would work only an hour a day and only just after noon when the day was at its warmest.
0,"Due to this, progress on their grounds was slow."
0,"It was a shame to cut such majestic grass, but for the couple, it could be put to better use."
0,"I stacked and bound it, separating out the other weeds, and told them that they could sell it if possible."
0,"In a month and a half's time, the hill's towering grass was cut back to the fence line and the season was well into winter."
1,"""Does it snow here?"""
0,I asked as I sat next to the fireplace.
0,"It was early January, and though the temperature felt more than frigid enough, I had not so much as seen a single cloud."
0,Hazel and Alfred looked at me from the table as they ate their scant meal.
0,"As the days of winter increased, the size of their plate decreased."
0,"I knew they were low on food, but portions that small could not keep them alive."
0,"""No, sweetie,"" Hazel replied."
0,"""It gets dryer and drier as winter grows on,"" Alfred, who now looked as malnourished as Hazel, added."
0,"""Don't let the clear sky and sun fool you."
0,"It may look warm, but by mid January, a cup of water left outside will freeze over within the hour."""
0,"After that small exchange, I sat silent and continued watching them eat."
0,"By now, they had grown accustomed to me not eating."
0,They never asked why.
0,It was as if one day they had came to some realization but never said what it was.
0,I was curious but did not feel a need to ask.
0,"""Were you able to sell the straw?"""
0,I asked to break the silence once again.
0,"""Only a little,"" Alfred replied."
0,He lifted his plate and licked off what little residue that remained.
0,"""But, I do have a use for what's left."
0,"I'll need your help with it too, son."""
0,"""When?"""
0,"""Tomorrow, if you're up to it."""
0,I nodded.
0,"After Hazel and Alfred finished what I could not bring myself to call a meal, I cleared the table and washed the plates and cutlery out back with water I had melted from ice I set in a bucket next to the fireplace."
1,By evening Hazel and Alfred had little energy to do anything more than lay in bed.
0,I spent my evenings lying in front of the fireplace staring at the interlocking woodwork of the ceiling as I kept the fire lit for fear of the small cottage growing too cold.
0,Alfred or Hazel dying in their sleep was a constant fear on my mind.
0,"With resolve to prevent this at all cost, I would stay up until morning or until I could fight sleep no longer."
0,"To my relief, Alfred and Hazel walked in as the light from the sunrise crept through the windows."
0,"With them sitting in their chairs in front of the fire, I was able to let sleep take me."
1,A nudge on the shoulder woke me from my dreamless sleep.
0,"As my hand worked to erase the sleep from my eyes, Alfred looked down at me."
0,"""You ready to work, son?"""
0,"He asked, trying to help me to my feet, but it felt more like I was his support as his shaking hand grasped my arm, and were I to move, Alfred would fall."
0,"Once I was standing, Alfred walked to the back door in his usual hobble."
0,"""What do you need me to do?"""
0,"I asked, wrapping the quilt over my shoulders."
0,"""I'll need your help in the cellar, today."""
0,"""The cellar?"""
0,His reply removed any remaining sleep still lingering.
0,"Until now, I was not so much as even allowed to touch the cellar door."
0,Alfred smiled back at me and bade me follow.
1,"Once out back in front of the cellar, Alfred bent down and lifted the latch."
0,"With great effort, he opened the doors and asked for my help descending the steep steps."
0,"""It won't be long before hazel and I are too old to come down here."""
0,I didn't think age was the problem so much as their lack of nourishment.
0,"""I'm surprised either of you are still able to move around,"" I replied as Alfred braced himself on my shoulder."
0,"""You haven't had a solid meal in weeks."""
0,"""What about you, my boy?"""
0,Alfred's eyebrow rose as he looked at me only a few inches from my face.
0,I remained silent.
0,"""This is not the first time Hazel and I have been in this position,"" Alfred continued as we lowered ourselves step by step into the cellar."
0,"""About two score years past we and our three children found ourselves trapped in our home after a terrible snow hit our countryside."""
1,"We reached the bottom of the steps, and Alfred grabbed a small lantern hanging beside us."
0,"With a piece of flint, he lit it to illuminate the room."
0,The cellar looked about a third the size of the cottage above it.
0,"It was cold, receiving none of the heat the small fire in the cottage produced."
0,"In the far right corner was an old table stained with blood, most likely used by Hazel to clean the meat."
0,"It looked no different than a normal cellar, making me wonder further why Alfred prevented me from entering."
0,Alfred sat himself down on a stool next to the butchering table.
0,"""Hazel and I had a small storage of food,"" Alfred said to continue his story, ""but it was only enough for three days."
0,"We rationed it to last longer, in case the storm decided to last."""
0,I sat down on the steps as I continued listening to Alfred's tale.
0,"""After a week, we dug our way out of the house, but no one else in the countryside fared any better."
0,Everyone in town joined their food supplies and portioned to each home according to their size.
0,"When we thought the weather was going to get better, another storm hit."
0,That was the final blow to our small village.
0,Food ran out.
0,We lost contact with the other families.
0,One by one our children died.
0,"Hazel and I were the only people remaining alive in the town, but because of that we were able to survive, we learned how to survive."
0,We lasted on whatever we could eat until the snow melted in spring.
0,"From then on we searched for a land where it never snowed and settled here."""
0,"""I'm sorry…"" I said with my head low."
0,"""Don't be."
0,We learned important lessons from it.
0,"One of which was how to keep on living."""
1,"""What was it that you needed help with?"""
0,"I asked, now more determined to do whatever I could for the waning couple."
0,Alfred nudged his head to the left.
0,"""Up against the wall, what does that look like to you?"""
0,On the left side of the cellar was what looked like a long block of chopped hay with a wide board sitting atop.
0,"""I'm not quite sure,"" I replied."
0,"""Go take a look,"" Alfred suggested."
0,I stood on my feet and walked over the cold stone floor to the odd block of hay.
0,"I felt the hay, and though the outer blades of the chopped hay fell to the ground at my touch, inside it was hard, cold."
0,"""Ice?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""Lift the lid."""
0,"I lifted up the lid and the smell of blood hit, forcing me to cover my nose."
0,"The inside was hollow, and the hay blocks making up the bottom were stained brown."
0,"""Meat storage?"""
0,I asked after closing the lid.
0,"""Son, you're smarter than other kids your age."
0,"That is correct."""
0,Alfred shifted to his feet and walked over to me.
0,"""Hay is a great insulator for both heat and cold."
0,Normally when you have a supply of meat you have to preserve with salt or dry it.
0,"With this, we can keep the meat fresh year round."""
0,Alfred pointed beside the stairs where a pile of wooden boxes sat.
0,"""Years ago I chopped grass to fit in those and filled the rest with water to create these ice blocks that can last through summer if kept underground."""
0,"""That's brilliant,"" I complimented."
0,"""But it doesn't last forever."
0,"As you might have realized when you touched the hay, there is not much ice left in the blocks, and on the inside, the hay is spoiled from the meat."""
0,"""The hay I cut could be used to build another,"" I thought out loud."
0,"""That's the plan."""
0,"""What do I need to do?"""
0,"I asked, ready to get to work."
0,"""You can start by removing all the old hay blocks and dumping them beside the cottage."
0,They'll compost once the seasons change.
0,"After that, bring down enough straw to fill all twenty molds sitting against the wall beside you."
0,"If you think you have enough, bring down a little more."
0,"Better to have too much than not enough."""
0,I stood awaiting any further instruction until Alfred told me to get to work.
0,"After removing the lid and setting it against the wall, I grabbed the hay brick by brick and carried it outside."
0,The smell of blood nauseated me.
0,"I half expected the hay bricks to crumble when I dropped them beside the house, but they stayed firm, even the bricks with little to no ice remaining inside."
0,"After finishing clearing out the hay bricks, I walked into the field to retrieve bundles of hay from the pile I had made."
0,"If chopped up, I estimated a bundle of hay per brick, but I brought in three more bundles as Alfred suggested."
0,"""Use these,"" Alfred said, handing me a square plank of wood heavier than its size should allow and a hatchet."
0,"""I expect it to take a couple of hours."
0,"I know I told you not to work too long in the cold, but…"""
0,"""I'll be fine,"" I assured him."
0,Alfred smiled.
0,"""I'll close the cellar door to keep out the draft."
0,There is extra oil for the lantern below it.
0,"With you working, it should heat up some in here, but I know you'll be fine."""
0,"""What about the water to make ice?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""I'm already making you work more today than we agreed."
0,"We'll deal with making the ice tomorrow."""
0,"With that, Alfred pulled himself up out of the cellar step by step."
0,"""Oh, and you saw how small the hay was chopped for the old bricks, right?"""
0,Alfred asked from outside the cellar.
0,"""I did,"" I replied."
0,"""I wanted to see how it would work if you chopped the hay smaller, more fine."""
0,"""I can do that,"" I replied."
0,"Without any further conversation, Alfred closed the cellar doors behind him, and I began my task of chopping the hay."
1,"As I chopped the hay on the plank of wood, I was surprised that the hatchet could not mar it."
0,The dark wood was rather resilient.
0,I made a mental not to ask Alfred what kind of tree it came from.
0,"As the afternoon passed on in the dim light of the lantern, more and more wooden molds filled up with hay."
0,"What I had not realized was that when chopping the hey smaller, more could fit into the box than I had previously thought."
0,"By my sixteenth box, I was sure the hay would not last to the twentieth, but I finished what I could before deciding to head out to get three more bundles of hay."
0,Little light shined through the cracks in the cellar doors.
0,Evening had come.
0,The sun was setting.
0,"I pushed up on the doors, but they would not open."
0,"""Odd,"" I said under my breath."
0,"I looked to see if there was something I was missing, but there were no handles, latches, or hinges on the inside of the door."
0,It was latched from the outside.
0,"I pushed a little harder, being careful not to break the door, but it stayed closed."
0,"Back down the stairs and sitting on the stool, I was puzzled why Alfred would lock me in here."
0,I brought my knees to my chest and sat wrapped in the warmth of the quilt for another hour waiting.
0,Neither Alfred nor Hazel had come to check up on me.
1,The cellar had now become dark with no light coming through the cracks in the cellar door nor light from the lantern now dry.
0,"I had no more hay to chop and could not leave the cellar to retrieve more, so I had no use for the lantern."
0,"After two more hours of waiting, I returned to the cellar door."
0,This time I banged on it.
0,"Something was not right, that much was obvious."
0,I feared the worst for the couple.
0,I continued rapping on the cellar door without rest.
1,It was not until another hour had past that I heard noise from the other side.
0,The latch slid and Hazel opened the door.
0,Tears built in her eyes.
0,"""What's wrong?"
0,"Where's Alfred?"""
0,I asked.
0,Only after I asked that question did the truth of my task hit me.
0,The box made of frozen hay was their meat storage.
0,I had thrown it away to build a new one.
0,I could not have done so if they still had meat to store.
0,It was empty.
0,"""You are out of food…"" I said, concerned."
0,Hazel nodded.
0,"""Alfred went hunting,"" Hazel explained."
0,"""Why didn't he ask me to help?"""
0,"I questioned, feeling hurt."
0,"""There is no way he is in the condition to hunt!"""
0,Hazel brought her hand to my cheek.
0,The touch was not much warmer than the night air.
0,"""That's why he told me to keep you locked up."
0,He knew you would help… but it's not something you could help with.
0,"We could never let you help, for your sake."""
0,"""I understand,"" I said although I did not understand in the slightest."
0,"""How long has he been gone?"""
0,"""He left soon after he put you to work,"" Hazel mumbled."
0,Hazel was shaking from the cold.
0,I could no longer draw our conversation on out here.
0,"""I'll finish what I was doing in the cellar."
0,Go back inside.
0,"I'll join you once I've finished."""
0,"""You're such a good child,"" Hazel said with a weak smile."
0,"""I'm glad we made the right choice."""
0,Hazel entered the dark cottage.
0,"Due to the danger, Hazel did not light a lantern or fire, but I had light enough under the moon and stars."
1,I grabbed three more bundles and carried them together back to the cellar to finished filling the remaining two boxes.
0,Afterwards I joined Hazel inside and huddled next to her to help stave off the cold.
0,"She was in terrible shape, although she tried not to show it."
0,Hazel's worry for her husband only served to accelerate her waning health.
0,"For three more hours Hazel waited, praying for Alfred's safe return."
0,In my heart I yearned for the same.
0,"Every minute was a lifetime of waiting, my ears ever searching for the slightest rustle or step."
0,I heard it.
0,"In the distance, something was approaching."
0,Hazel must not have noticed as her hunched position never changed.
0,"As the sound approached, it grew more and more unfamiliar."
0,"It was too large to be Alfred, possibly two people."
0,I inched to the kitchen and grabbed for the knife while staying below the window.
0,The noise stumbled.
0,This time Hazel took notice.
0,She looked up and noticed me brandishing a knife by the back door.
0,I held out my hand to silence her.
0,"The noise continued up the hill and became two distinct sounds, one set of footsteps, and something dragging."
0,"My heart lifted with excitement, but I had to be certain."
0,I lifted my head up to see through the window.
0,"Ascending the hill was a hunched man dragging a familiar sack, this time twice the size as it had been before."
1,I threw my knife on the floor and bolted out the back door.
0,Alfred greeted me with a smile as the cold sweat of his struggle with the bag ran down his worn face.
0,"With Alfred supported on my shoulder and sack in hand, I drug it the remainder of the path."
0,"What Alfred had been able to kill was no smaller than me, and had to weigh about the same, an astonishing feat for a man as weak and aged as him."
0,"At Alfred's request, I left the sack by the back door."
1,"Once inside, Hazel fell into Alfred's chest."
0,She began to sob but cut herself off.
0,"""We you able to find one?"""
0,she asked.
0,Alfred returned a weary smile.
0,"""Could not have gone better."
0,"You know what to do."""
0,Hazel pulled Alfred down and kissed him on the forehead before inching her way out the back door.
0,"I was about to go out with her to help, but Alfred called me back."
0,"""Have you forgotten?"""
0,he asked as he sat down on a chair by the table.
0,"""Forgotten?"""
0,"""My duty is to hunt, Hazel's is to clean."
0,"Stay inside."""
0,"""But… she can barely walk,"" I protested."
0,"""Please…"" Alfred begged."
0,"""Let her do this."""
0,"Alfred had given me many orders during my stay at the cottage, but this was the first time he had given a genuine request."
0,My will was gone.
0,"Dejected, I returned to the fireplace and sat down."
0,Alfred grabbed a piece of flint and lit the small candle on the table.
0,"""Thank you."""
0,"""For what?"""
0,I asked.
0,"""For helping us regain a little bit of our humanity,"" Alfred replied."
0,"""I don't understand."""
0,"Before Alfred could explain, Hazel came in the back door."
0,She carried what looked like folded clothing.
0,"""We have something for you,"" Hazel said as she held the bundle close to her chest."
0,"""I'm sorry we couldn't have provided it to you sooner,"" Alfred added."
0,I retrieved what Hazel carried and set it on the table.
0,On top the pile was a pair of laced boots with a hard-leather sole.
0,"Below were a dark green wool coat, a white shirt, some rugged, yet thick brown trousers, and white stockings."
0,"""It's all for you,"" Hazel said with joy."
0,"""I tried to get the size right."
0,"I hope they fit,"" Alfred added."
0,I had never once to my memory had clothes of my own.
0,Words escaped me.
0,I could not but stare at the gift on the table.
0,"""Put them on,"" Alfred ordered."
0,"At his word, I dropped the quilt and grabbed the trousers."
0,Hazel held onto the quilt as I donned the shirt and pulled up the stockings over my feet.
0,"The boots were a little big on my feet, but I could not complain."
0,The last piece was the coat.
0,"The moment my arms entered the sleeves, my body heat radiated inside the coat."
0,It was warm.
0,I pulled the coat closer in to trap the heat for fear of it escaping.
0,Hazel then placed the quilt back over my shoulders and wrapped me in it.
0,Tears grew in my eyes.
0,"Why did this couple, who had nothing, find it in themselves to try and give me everything?"
0,I felt horrible.
0,I felt guilty.
0,"But, I couldn't turn down their generosity."
0,"""Do you like it?"""
0,Hazel asked.
0,I could only nod.
0,Alfred straightened in his chair.
0,"""You will accept these gifts on one condition."""
0,I faced Alfred with full intent to do anything he asked.
0,He had already given me so much.
0,"""You must leave, tonight."""
0,"""What?"""
0,"I let go of the quilt, dropping it to the floor."
0,"""Why?"""
0,"""Do you like the clothes?"""
0,Alfred asked.
0,"""Yes, but.--"""
0,"""Then take them and leave."""
0,"If accepting the clothes meant I had to leave Alfred and Hazel to survive the remainder of winter on their own, I didn't want them."
0,"I began to remove the coat, but Hazel stopped me."
0,"""Sweetie…"""
0,"""I'll rephrase it."""
0,Alfred's voice lacked the gentleness it had before.
0,"""I'm telling you to leave."
0,"We don't want you to stay any longer."""
0,"""How can you say that?"""
0,My mind circled in confusion.
0,"After my trial period, Alfred had agreed to let me stay for the winter."
0,I was sure that I worked enough to make myself of worth to them.
0,And I was sure that Alfred had asked for my help to rebuild his hay box for meat storage.
0,"""Who's cottage is this?"""
0,Alfred asked.
0,"""Yours…"" I mumbled."
0,"""Who has the final decision on who lived here?"""
0,"I looked at Hazel, but she avoided eye contact."
0,"""You do."""
0,I replied to Alfred.
0,"""Do you understand?"""
0,"""Yes…"" I replied."
0,"""When do I have to leave?"""
0,"""Immediately, and don't look back"""
0,"""Then I will leave immediately and not look back."""
0,I walked over to the front door and opened the latch.
0,"With one foot out the door, I nodded at the elderly couple who had been kind enough to let an unknown boy stay in their home when their home was all they had to offer."
0,"As I closed the door, I heard Alfred say ""Dear, it has been long since we've had a good meal."
0,"Let's make this one big."""
0,*  *  *
1,Walking felt foreign.
0,My feet could not feel the stubble of the once majestic grass on the hill.
0,The dirt of the path did not get stuck between my toes.
0,Rocks on the road did not pain my feet.
0,I could not answer whether I liked it or not.
0,"I felt more detached from my walking, less feeling, less connection."
0,I longed for the grass taller than me.
0,I longed for the elderly woman who greeted me with a knife at her back door.
0,"More than anything, I longed for the old man who barked orders but was kind enough to keep the fireplace lit for me as I slept."
0,"I had said I would not look back, but I had to see the cottage on the hill one last time if at all possible."
0,I looked over my shoulder and turned back to the path behind me.
0,"There was a bright glow in the distance on a hill surrounded with trees, smoke billowing up from the light."
0,My breath stopped and my head went numb.
0,"Without order, my legs ran me back down the path as fast as my boots allowed them."
0,"Through the groves of trees and across the fields I ran, the flaming glow on the hill getting ever larger."
0,My heart began to race as the height of the grass on the roadside grew until it was again taller than me.
1,I was at the hill.
0,A mob of people stood outside the small cottage as the flames grew ever higher.
0,Their angered shouts echoed over the hillside.
0,"With farm tools in hand, they cheered as the porch crumbled."
0,I dropped the quilt and ran to the hill.
0,The rotten fence cracked and splintered as I ran through it.
0,"The noise alerted some of the mob of my approach, but they did not stop me."
0,"With a prayer in my heart, I ran past the mob and dove through the front window into the inferno as one of the mob called out, ""Aaron!"""
1,Fire lapped and smoke choked as I made my way in the flames.
0,"Once in the kitchen, I froze."
0,"Three bodies lay burning by the broken table two adults, both impaled by some unrecognizable tool, and a third, a boy my size, lying atop the table."
0,I could take no more.
0,I ran past and crashed through the back door.
0,"The warm home, warm welcome, was no more."
1,Some of the villagers heard the crash and came running around back.
0,"""Aaron!"""
0,the man called out again.
0,He ran to me and placed his arms on my shoulders.
0,One look and he pushed me way.
0,"""Who are you?!"""
0,"he questioned, grabbing a pitchfork from another villager."
0,I stepped back.
0,"""I said, who are you?!"
0,"Why are you wearing my son's clothes?!"""
0,The man walked forward with pitchfork pointed at me.
0,"I continued to step away, but the faster I retreated, the faster the man followed."
0,"By the time I reached the bundles of grass I had piled up over winter, the man had enough of chasing me."
0,He pinned me against the stack with my neck between the two prongs of the pitchfork.
0,"""Are you with those two monsters?!"
0,"Have you been killing our children?!"""
0,I looked at the man.
0,"I could feel his anger, his sadness, and I knew that I was responsible for the death of his son."
0,"Had I never come to the cottage, his son may have never died."
0,"""They took me in,"" I explained, ""at the start of winter."
0,"I worked for lodging, but never for food."
0,"I ate nothing they offered."""
0,I found it hard to keep eye contact.
0,"""They kept me, even when they had nothing themselves."
0,"Alfred, Hazel, They aren't bad people."""
0,"The man pressed hard on the pitchfork, digging it into the ground and choking me."
0,"""They are not people!"
0,"They were monsters that preyed on our small town… How can you say…"" His voice faded."
0,I tried to reply between gasps for breath.
0,"""They gave me warmth… when no one else would…"""
0,The man lightened up on the pitchfork.
0,"""They did it for me… I'm sorry."
0,"It is my fault your son died."""
0,Tears ran down the man's face.
0,He lifted the pitchfork off me.
0,"With a trembling hand, he aimed it at my stomach."
0,I closed my eyes to await my punishment when I felt the presence of someone kneeling beside me.
0,"A boy about my age had one hand on the pitchfork and the other on the man's arm, but the man did not notice the boy's sudden appearance."
0,"The man shook, trying to find the will to finish me but, in the end, dropped the pitchfork and fell to his knees."
0,The boy who appeared moved beside the man and faced me.
0,It was then I noticed.
0,"The boy had the same green wool coat, same shirt, same trousers that Hazel and Alfred had given me."
0,More surprising to me was the boys face.
0,"Until now, I had never been able to make out the details of anyone's face, but this boy's showed in perfect clarity."
0,"His deep blue eyes, smiling pink lips, even the freckles on his cheeks gave his face character that had been unknown to me until now."
0,The boy pointed off away from the hill as if telling me to leave.
0,I rolled to my knees and took off down the hill.
0,"I chanced a glance back at the man and boy, but the boy was nowhere to be seen."
0,"The man was alone, kneeling in the stubble of the grass with his hands to his face."
1,"Once at the base of the hill, I retrieved Hazel's quilt and hid behind a bush in a grove of trees."
0,"All wrapped up in the quilt once more, I huddled against the rough trunk of a tree for comfort and cried."
0,"""There, there, dear,"" came a light-hearted raspy voice in my mind."
0,"""It's not your fault."""
