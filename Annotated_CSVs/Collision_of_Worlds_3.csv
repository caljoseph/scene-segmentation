“Leadership comes not from blood but from bonds.” 
Ceil "
1,Numerous villagers stood around the edges of Heivleil’s center square to see a sight most never imagined would happen in their tiny village.
0,Many covered their mouth both out of shock and to shield their breath from the plentiful dust blowing through their village.
0,"The wealthiest family in the village of Heivleil, located at the far corner of the Filinceil plains on the northeast edge of the Amelian Empire, had the misfortune of moving to the formerly idyllic farmlands just before the beginning of a severe drought and famine that persisted for a year and a half and showed no signs of ending."
0,"Driven into desperation, this family did the unthinkable."
0,"They sold their only daughter, Ceil, then only a year and a half in age."
0,"From the exquisite hand-drawn carriage to the High Elf honor guard dressed in polished white armor accentuated with golden tassels, the family must have sold Ceil for a high price to a noble family."
0,“No…” Ceil cried weakly.
0,"She pulled back against the grip of the High Elf honor guard, but his grip only tightened, and she was lifted into his arms."
0,“No!
0,Mom!
0,Dad!
0,I’m sorry!” 
0,"Ceil cried and flailed, but her body was too weak from the endless days of famine she had known her entire young life."
0,"She couldn’t free herself from her captor, and none of the spectating adults dared interfere with the royal guard."
0,"They only watched the harrowing scene, the girl’s shrill cries piercing their ears."
0,"The only villager who tried to interfere was Linoa, a young village girl only older than Ceil by a season."
0,She lost her younger sister to the famine at the end of summer and immediately clung to Ceil as a replacement.
0,"The two were inseparable, until three guards were called over to pin Linoa to the ground in the center of the square with a knee in her back and her face pressed into the dust."
0,“I’m sorry I didn’t listen.
0,I’m sorry I wrestled and my tails showed!
0,I don’t want to go.
0,Don’t sell me!”
0,"Arlen could not look at her daughter out of guilt, and Lum only watched, feeling that this was in his daughter’s best interest and benefited the village and the entire famine-ravaged territory."
0,"The sale of Ceil would enable them to buy much needed food and supplies from the neighboring territories untouched by the famine, and perhaps, if what he learned was true, the famine might soon end with Ceil removed."
0,"“Please!” Ceil pushed against the soldier’s chest, arms, and helmet as he tried to set her in the white, silk-canopied rickshaw."
0,Her hand pressed at his chin and neck through his helmet trying with all her might to separate from her captor.
0,"For a brief moment in the height of her fear, she saw a skeletal hand enveloped in hers, dark and putrid."
0,"Life distorted where she touched into something twisted and unnatural, rotting the royal guard’s skin."
0,The man pushed Ceil into the rickshaw before lurching over and vomiting uncontrollably.
0,"He tossed his helmet off, and the next heave was mixed with blood."
0,He held his neck to heal whatever evil Ceil had done.
0,"She huddled in the corner of the bench, grasping the silken fabric cover on the side with white knuckles and wide eyes, too terrified to question what happened or what she did or what she saw."
0,The honor guard recovered after strenuous effort and took a long swig from the water skin the Mountain Elf rickshaw driver handed him.
0,No one grew angry at Ceil.
0,No one accused her.
0,No one scolded her.
0,"A fairy dressed in a simple white gown walked beside the rickshaw and mounted it, ignoring the ill guard."
0,She sat beside Ceil and bowed her head.
0,“Do not be afraid.
0,We will not hurt you.
0,"I am your maid and caretaker, a gift from High King Dhurin of Vallen to Emperor Yuro Amel of the Amelian Empire for you, Ceil, future wife to the emperor.”"
1,"* * *
Two Whinhlem Years Later."
0,"A somber air blew through a circular room carved out from the inside of the trunk of a giant tree in the Gallanvale, the fairy capital of Vallen."
0,The candlesticks on the wall held not candles but waxy and fibrous plants that flickered with a faint yellow-green flame.
0,"Intricate carvings of plants and animals decorated the walls, but even they appeared to drown in the melancholy light."
0,"Around a large oval table carved from that same trunk and still connected by its wooden legs to the floor of the room sat twenty short and slim figures with sweating, pale faces."
0,Their pointed ears drooped ever so slightly and twitched in the cold draft from the open windows.
0,The source of their sorrow came from a small torn strip of parchment that had appeared when a spatial pixie messenger teleported in and promptly left again.
0,The woman closest to the message picked it up and scanned the contents.
0,"Her lips quivered, and she struggled to speak."
0,"“How many are confirmed dead now?” An elderly fairy gripped his patchwork beard between his fingers, the tension threatening to pull the hairs from their follicles."
0,The fairy holding the message swallowed the hot coal that clogged her throat.
0,"“Eighty and nine now, but more are expected."
0,"Many of the races have yet to report, and they have only received partial reports from the others.” She hung her head in her hands and stared blankly at the table."
0,“If only that coward had come for me first!
0,Then at least our own High King would still be alive!”
0,"The white-bearded fairy, Thorn General of Vallen, slammed his fist full of beard hair on the table."
0,He and Fairy High King Dhurin had been targets of assassination by the Human Kingdom of Tolmyur.
0,The king was the primary target and was found with his head impaled by a crude stone spike.
0,The assassin then targeted the Thorn General but found him a far more skilled earth mage and was promptly disposed of.
0,"“What is of greater concern is the state of Amel,” the woman interrupted."
0,"She was the chief advisor to the late Fairy High King and wife to the Thorn General, although by her appearance she looked more like his daughter, being youthful despite her years."
0,Her eyes fell on the young High Elf girl who stayed silent at the conference table.
0,“Not only the royal family but also the prominent voices of the council and military leaders were all assassinated in a single night.
0,"We know the marshals are trying to keep public order, but…”"
0,The young High Elf had arrived in the home of the chief advisor and her husband late that evening.
0,"The young woman’s maid, a fairy and practitioner of spatial magic charged with the protection of the royal family, a Namie, had teleported the young woman there to save her life."
0,"The young woman was Emperor Yuro’s newest wife, Ceil."
0,"“Lady Ceil is the only survivor, but most of the empire does not know about her.”"
0,A sense of dread spread over the room with another gust of wind chilled by the winter air.
0,The Amelian Empire was not traditionally a monolithic body under the iron rule of a Supreme Emperor but a gathering of independent sovereignties who sat in council united under an emperor who oversaw the council.
0,"However, over the past few millennia, the strength of the council and influence of the emperor had grown immeasurably."
0,"Each race under the banner of the empire kept their reigning chiefs, kings, matriarchs, and other ruling heads, but the council’s will became law for the sovereignties of the empire with the emperor’s words holding the strongest weight."
0,"In the face of conflicting opinions and feverish arguments among the council, the voice of the emperor became the reality that the council must obey."
0,"The influence of the emperor and council weakened the positions of the local ruling heads of the races, making them little more than figure heads."
0,"Each race within the empire had become dependent on the emperor and council, but both had been eliminated all at once."
0,"The monolith that bore the full weight of the Amelian Empire had been dealt a crippling blow, and the only one who remained to hold that crumbling pillar together with her small hands was Ceil."
0,"“She was never raised in the court, so we cannot expect her to restore order to the Amelian Empire without any experience in governance let alone command in the midst of war.”"
0,"“And if we do set her on the throne, the few surviving council members will likely try to manipulate her or marry her to their sons in a buy for power.” "
0,Others at the table nodded in agreement.
0,"While strengthening the pillar that supported the empire was important, they needed to be certain that hasty repairs would not lead to the pillar weakening and breaking over time."
0,"The assassinations would destabilize the empire, but the effects would not appear immediately."
0,"While each race mourned and distressed over the loss of their leaders, they could recover before their enemy had time to muster enough forces to attack in their weakened state."
0,Immediate invasion by the Tolmyur Kingdom was impossible due to the mountainous Stollmuk Kingdom that acted as a wall between the Amelian Empire and the Tolmyur Kingdom.
0,The nation of golems provided a near perfect defense in exchange for much needed food and other organic resources that were scarce in their region.
0,They had time.
0,“Do we even know if there are any High Elves on the council who survived?
0,"Marriage to other races would provide little, and producing a suitable heir would be impossible unless her husband was a High Elf or fairy.”"
0,“Or a Pixie.” 
0,“Don’t ask for the impossible.” 
0,“The High Elves would not accept anything but another High Elf.
0,The purity of the bloodline has always helped with the stability of the empire.
0,"If other races learn that they too can vie for power, conflict will only follow.”"
0,Many heads nodded around the table.
0,"All the while, Ceil sat silently, unable to voice her will as the council discussed her future and the fate of the Amelian Empire."
1,The discussion over the feasibility of Ceil succeeding the throne and what measures would be needed to preserve the existing royal authority continued past sunup and through the morning.
0,The stagnating conversation was interrupted by the appearance of a small spatial pixie warping in above the table.
0,"He shivered, but whether it was from the cold air or the message he would soon deliver, no one could tell."
0,Every head at the table could only hold in their weary sighs.
0,How high would the death count climb now?
0,Only the Thorn General noticed the deep terror in the boy’s eyes.
0,“Amel is under attack by the Tolmyur Kingdom!
0,They are overwhelmed!
0,They call for aid!”
0,The air of the room froze in a chill far stronger that the darkest blizzard of the northern wilderlands.
0,“How is that possible?”
0,"The Thorn General stood from his chair, causing it to teeter and almost fall."
0,“The Stollmuk Kingdom has been able to hold back against the Tolmyur filth for ages.
0,"If it fell, we would have received word long ago!”"
0,“What of the Asleids?
0,Oreads?” The marshal asked.
0,"“Their mountains and glens would have been next before reaching Amel, and we have not received word of an invasion from them when they reported the assassinations of their sires.”"
0,"“The humans did not cross the mountains,” the pixie cried."
0,“They teleported directly to the city!”
0,The fairy council rose in an uproar.
0,Large scale teleportation of that magnitude was unheard of.
0,"If nations could use spatial magic well enough to transport large armies into the center of a major city, the world would be in chaos."
0,The laws of spatial teleportation were immutable.
0,"The larger the portal, the more unstable and prone to collapse it became."
0,The size limit prevented even the smallest of the colossal races from using spatial teleportation.
0,"Teleportation formulas needed to factor in each person that would use it, and the complexity of the formula increased exponentially with each additional person."
0,Portals could not be created near each other without causing unpredictable and potentially lethal interference to each portal.
0,This included not only the portal’s entrance but also the exit.
0,"Even if Tolmyur had an abundance of spatial mages, something that was also impossible due to the human ilk’s weak magic aptitude, teleportation required a large amount of ven."
0,"According to all the knowledge of this world, a method to teleport a sizable army did not exist."
0,"The pixie’s story would have been plausible if it was an elite task force, not an army large enough to overwhelm the capital."
0,"“Did they appear outside the city, not inside?”"
0,“Do you really think it would be possible to orchestrate a massive teleportation into such a populated city?” 
0,“They shouldn’t have even been able to do it at all!” 
0,“What of the capital’s defenses?” 
0,"“Yes, how long can they hold out?!”"
0,The council members rattled off questions and comments with the pixie trying to find time to cut in.
0,"He had to speak over the others, even if it meant shouting at those of higher status than he."
0,“The army is in disarray with the military leaders assassinated!
0,The city will not last the day at current!” The pixie was red-faced and breathing heavily.
0,"“Then the fairies will come to their aid,” the Thorn General announced."
0,“We will show those accursed humans why the sovereign elfkind Kingdoms created the Amelian Empire.”
0,The council shouted in agreement.
0,"“I will teleport immediately to Amel and organize the troops there to hold off until the armies of the Empire arrive,” the Thorn General announced."
0,“We will organize two thirds of our available troops and march on Amel.”
0,“Would that not leave us weakened?” the Gallanvale’s city marshal interrupted.
0,“I doubt they would have the manpower to attack two cities at once if they brought an army sufficient to assault the capital.
0,I also doubt they would attack a territory where the assassination of a military leader had failed.
0,Humans are cowards.” 
0,The Thorn General’s reasoning appeased the marshal.
0,"“Boy, send word to the other sovereignties of the empire."
0,They have one day to organize and march on Amel.
0,Also tell them that one member of the royal family yet lives.
0,We will not let the flame of our empire that has burned for over fifty-thousand years be extinguished!”
0,"The council shouted once again, and the Pixie vanished having received a new message."
0,Ceil shuddered at the general’s proclamation.
0,She could not remain seated.
0,"From the moment Ceil was brought to the council room upon her arrival, she sat in silence."
0,Her sudden movement startled those at the table.
0,She spoke through trembling lips.
0,"“I am not royalty… Sorry, but I cannot lead the empire.”"
0,Visible surprise and anger grew on the faces of many at the table.
0,The chief advisor wrapped her arm around the frail woman.
0,“We are not asking you to.
0,"Not yet,” she said, leaning her head against Ceil’s shoulder."
0,"Looking back at those glaring at Ceil, her face became rigid."
0,“You know what you must do.
0,Go!”
0,The room emptied.
0,The Thorn General joined the marshal who was a spatial mage and teleported to Amel.
0,Only Ceil and the chief advisor remained in the room.
0,The chief advisor held Ceil softly on the shoulders and looked up into her eyes.
0,"Ceil was only a head taller than the fairy, being short for a High Elf, which only added to her youthful appearance."
0,Ceil could not muster the courage to look the fairy in the eyes.
0,"Although the chief advisor’s face was calm and assuring, Ceil knew she was angry."
0,"“I understand that you are scared and may feel inadequate, but you must learn to think before you speak."
0,These assassinations and the subsequent invasion could be the herald of the greatest disaster to befall the empire since its founding.
0,The people need something to place hope in.
0,We do not need a leader right now.
0,"We need a symbol, a beacon, and you are that beacon."
0,Revealing to the council that you do not desire to lead the people is the same as telling them that their hope for the future of the Amelian Empire is lost.
0,Surely you see this.” 
0,The advisor grew a brief smile before returning to her serious but calm expression.
0,"“We will have you speak to the soldiers before they leave, so please take some time to think about how to inspire them.”"
0,The advisor called in Ceil’s maid and ordered the maid to take Ceil to her personal quarters.
1,Ceil stared at the bare heels that would only just peak out from under her maid’s simple white dress as she walked.
0,The dimly lit corridor opened to a bridge tall enough to fit a large carriage or wagon underneath.
0,It was eloquently carved from a branch of the tree and connected to a similar yet thinner tree on the far side.
0,The short and incredibly stout trees of this forest were grown specifically for use as structures.
0,The foreign scenery of a city crafted from trees would have excited Ceil to no end if not for the events that had brought her here.
0,She did not even notice the verdant cityscape to her left or right.
0,She only continued to stare melancholy at the heels of the maid that led her.
0,"The corridor at the end of the bridge promptly became a downward-spiraling staircase through the trunk of the tree and led to a small, grassy, and cobblestoned courtyard surrounded by a wall of large thorny vines and beautiful flowers with blue, diamond-shaped petals."
0,"The branches of the trees along the thorny walls created a full verdant canopy that let in shining flecks of green sunlight through their transparent, almost glass-like leaves."
0,Not once did Ceil look up to admire the beauty of the garden court.
0,A stone structure with simple flowering ivy growing up its walls sat in the very center of the courtyard.
0,"Beside the door fashioned from a single log of bright red wood stood two armored guards with long, leaf-like spears."
0,Ribbons of cerulean and the same verdant green of the trees fell from the links of their pauldrons and cuffs.
0,"Until only the day before, they had guarded the Fairy High King."
0,Now they guarded the emperor’s widow.
0,"The guards bowed their heads when the maid and Ceil approached, but Ceil did not so much as acknowledge them."
0,She still only looked at the heels of the maid that led her.
0,The maid greeted them lightly and opened the door to the small structure.
0,"Once Ceil was inside, the maid bowed and left, locking the door behind her."
1,Ceil was left alone in the small stone room with floral walls and ceiling.
0,"It contained nothing more than a bed, wardrobe, sofa, and in the far corner, a marble tub and polished silver mirror."
0,The room was eerily quiet.
0,The guards did not converse with each other.
0,The maid never spoke before leaving.
0,The silent air was suffocating.
0,"If there was at least some noise, Ceil could distract her thoughts by focusing on it, but now her mind was free to process the events at the palace and the conversation in the fairy council room where the general and chief advisor talked about her future as if she was not there or her opinion did not matter."
0,"Neither of them ever introduced themselves, so Ceil did not know their names let alone the names of anyone on the fairy council."
0,Ceil laid down on the bed and curled her knees to her chest.
0,She bit into the tip of her thumb so hard the skin threatened to break.
0,"Angry tears grew in her eyes, but she stifled the cry in her throat that tried to accompany them."
0,"Ceil was a political figure to the fairies, nothing more."
0,"She had traded the regal prison of the High Elf palace for a guarded cell in a fairy garden, only this time, Eydis was not there and couldn’t be no matter how much Ceil wished she could."
0,"Ceil pulled her two long and elegant tails up between her legs and began massaging their smooth tips with her hand, something she had seen Eydis do with her own tail on many occasions when Eydis was sad or troubled."
0,The shivers the message sent through her body helped Ceil calm down.
0,"In this position Ceil fell asleep, having stayed up the entire night and through the morning in the council room."
1,Ceil was awoken abruptly by her maid shaking her shoulder.
0,She stated that someone named Kiri requested her presence.
0,The short rest Ceil managed was insufficient to recover her stamina.
0,What little physical recuperation she received was overpowered by the emotional and mental exhaustion that only grew from her restless dreams of Eydis and the terrifying night at the palace.
0,She felt far more tired than before lying on the bed.
0,Her maid led Ceil to a marble tub in the corner of the room and undressed her.
0,"Ceil was unable to enjoy the quick, shallow bath and was asked to get out so she could be dried and dressed."
0,Ceil had become accustomed to such treatment in the palace and let her maid do as she pleased.
0,"Ceil looked at herself in the tall, polished silver mirror beside the tub as her maid dried her hair, face, and shoulders."
0,The maid moved down her body to her tails.
0,The overstimulation of her tails being rubbed in the soft woolen fabric of the towel made Ceil cringe.
0,"She had grown accustomed to it from childhood, but the truth was that Ceil’s tails were not only longer but also far more sensitive than most."
0,Even Eydis who also had a highly sensitive tail was surprised at how much more sensitive Ceil’s were.
0,"Though Ceil learned to comfort herself with her tails, she hated them even more, since it was because of her tails that she was bought, like her tails were prized objects without a person attached."
0,"It was a horrid feeling that she could never escape, not after being taken away to Amel."
0,"Once drying was finished, the maid helped Ceil step into an underskirt which she pulled up and over her tails."
0,Her maid then tucked Ceil’s tails into a fabric cradle on the underside.
0,This was common for long-tailed girls like Ceil in order to prevent their tails from showing beneath a skirt or other clothing.
0,"After all, a woman’s tail had to remain hidden to all men but her husband, but Ceil’s late husband had never seen them."
0,The dress the maid provided was simple silk with a faint purple hue.
0,Ceil liked the color and knew that her maid had chosen it out of consideration of Ceil’s tastes.
0,"Although the maid kept herself distant, Ceil knew that the maid did care for her."
0,Ceil walked closer to the mirror.
0,"The maid combed Ceil’s long, dark blond hair and wove it into a loose braid."
0,All that was left was to do something about the shadows under Ceil’s eyes.
0,Ceil channeled some life magic into her pointer and middle fingers and began massaging the soft skin.
0,The shadows slowly vanished.
0,"This was only a temporary remedy, and the shadows would return if she did not get proper rest."
1,"Ceil’s maid led her out the door, and the two guards accompanied them outside the forest city by hand-drawn carriage to a stone military garrison."
0,The person named Kiri who requested audience with Ceil was the same chief advisor from the council chamber.
0,She greeted Ceil at the entrance to the fort and brought her inside the crudely simple structure.
0,"“The morale of the soldiers is high,” Kiri said."
0,“You do not need to say much.
0,Just tell them you are relying on them and that you are sending them your blessing for their victory.”
0,Kiri walked Ceil up stone steps lit by the same waxy plants that lit the council room.
1,They passed through a green curtain to a balcony looking over a large field.
0,Thousands of fairies stood in formation on the ground with the few hundred capable of flight with wispy feathered wings made from raw ven lined in formation in the air along the edges.
0,Ceil had never seen such a massive force of people.
0,"The stout fairy at the head of the balcony spoke to the group explaining the situation in the capital city, Amel, and the assault by the Tolmyur Kingdom."
0,"Another military officer beside him used wind magic to propel the man’s voice throughout the entire field, creating strange echoes to the left and right."
0,He then introduced Ceil as the only surviving member of the royal family and that she would address them.
0,"After his introduction, Kiri walked Ceil forward with a soft hand and then returned to the entrance of the balcony."
0,The only other person who stood with Ceil was the unknown fairy tasked with sending her message across the field.
0,Ceil froze in silence.
0,A child from the countryside raised in a palace for no other purpose than bearing children for the now dead emperor had no place standing in front of an army giving words of encouragement to soldiers who could lose their lives.
0,The wrong person was standing here.
0,Ceil felt that she should have died and Eydis should have escaped.
0,Ceil balled her fists and closed her eyes.
0,"Taking a deep breath, she shouted, “I am not royalty!”"
0,Kiri was about to run up to Ceil but was stopped by Ceil’s maid.
0,"“I am not royalty,” Ceil repeated."
0,“I was born on the plains of the north.
0,"I am a common farm girl who has no ties to the government, royalty, or military."
0,"I know nothing of people, places, or ruling, but by some fate and whim the emperor took me to wife."
0,He never showed me affection.
0,He never showed he loved me.
0,I was nothing more to him than some oddity he purchased.
0,I am not sad that he is gone.”
0,The wind mage sent Ceil’s message over the field but stopped in horror after her last sentence.
1,The concept of royalty or ruling was foreign to Ceil.
0,She was born as the sole daughter of a wealthy farming family--at least wealthy compared to the other families in Heivleil.
0,A long drought and famine in the Filinceil Plains threatened to bring ruin to her family and village.
0,"Her father, Lum, chose to reveal the secret of their family--their daughter with two tails--to a few choice nobles with the hope that their family could obtain favor in exchange for the sale of their daughter."
0,The success of their announcement was far beyond Lum’s grandest dreams.
0,"He had thought they might gain the interest of at least one lesser noble, perhaps a descendent of the royal family whose ancestor was sibling to the emperor or empress, but he could not have dreamt Emperor Yuro Amel would take personal interest in Ceil."
0,The Emperor’s bargain exceeded expectations.
0,He announced her family as nobility and provided a small estate within Amel.
0,"Ceil was then married to the Emperor in secret due to her very young age of only a year and a half, and she lived inside the palace without ever seeing the emperor for an entire year."
0,"Only after the changes in her body showed she had become able to bear children did the emperor call for her, but only to announce that her marriage to him would soon be made public."
0,Ceil was then left to wait another year without ever seeing her husband.
0,"The only panacea for the grueling education, indoctrination, and conditioning that Ceil’s caretakers claimed she needed to be recognized as royalty was the first princess, Eydis FeAmel."
0,Eydis wrapped Ceil in her arms and showed her that the palace was not a prison.
0,"The walls were cold and thick, but warmth could be found within the company of others, and fun could be had with only minor breaches of rules and protocol."
0,Ceil had found a loving older sister in Eydis.
0,"As the day of Ceils marriage announcement approached, she grew apprehensive and desired with all her heart that this was all a mistake."
0,The man that was her husband had never shown her any affection and had never taken the time to know her.
0,"He never visited her, not once."
0,The reason that the emperor had not shown any affection to Ceil became clear on the few opportunities she had to meet the other wives.
0,She was not yet ripe enough for him.
0,The other wives of the emperor were much older than the emperor.
0,Why he chose such a young girl for wife in direct contrast to his tastes would have been a mystery if not for Ceil’s tails.
0,"All that man knew about Ceil was her two long tails, and that was apparently enough."
0,"She was only one of two elves in the entire empire with two tails, the other being over one hundred years of age and widow of Emperor Yuro’s great aunt."
0,"Perhaps two-tailed Elves marrying into the royal family whenever they appeared was tradition, but that did not matter to Ceil, and there were far too few like her through history to be certain."
0,"What she was certain of was that the emperor only saw her as a rare specimen, a collectable object, an oddity."
0,"And soon, Ceil would be forced to bear children to such a man."
0,The time of her public reveal approached.
0,"Ceil confided with Eydis, spilling her heart day after day."
0,Eydis did her best to console Ceil and worked with her to plan ways to make marriage life enjoyable.
0,"She even taught Ceil the bed manners and techniques she had learned from her first instructor, Evhial."
0,"As a final precaution, Eydis taught Ceil simple life magic guaranteed to prevent pregnancy until she felt she was ready, even if Ceil could do nothing about the act itself."
0,That final night of consultation was the same night the assassin appeared.
0,"Having practiced the contraceptive magic all evening under Eydis’s supervision, Ceil grew tired from ven exhaustion and left for her own chambers which formerly served as a guest room in the west wing of the palace."
0,"When warning flares lit the sky and word spread that the twin sons of the king had been killed, that the royal family needed to escape, Ceil attempted to run to Eydis’s quarters."
0,Her personal maid grabbed her before she could fly out her door and teleported outside the palace grounds.
0,There they stayed hidden until the maid could fashion a teleportation formula to take them to the maid’s homeland of the fairies.
0,"The night was mid-dark when the report from the palace reached the fairy council, and Ceil learned she was the only survivor of the attack."
1,Ceil’s prolonged silence worried all who stood on the balcony.
0,"The wind mage exchanged glances between Ceil and Chief Advisor Kiri, wondering if he should continue broadcasting Ceil’s words after her last statement or if Ceil had finished what she had to say."
0,Then something changed.
0,A flame lit in Ceil’s eyes that compelled him to continue.
0,"“I am not the one who should be standing before you,” Ceil spoke, her initial words almost too quiet to send across the field."
0,“First Princess Eydis FeAmel should have claimed the throne of the Amelian Empire.
0,"Eydis was my rising sun and guiding moon, but she was stolen from me, from all of us."
0,Those humans took from me the last person who ever truly cared for me!”
0,Ceil gritted her teeth and grabbed the banister.
0,The breath she took caught in her throat and threatened to choke out the tears welling in her eyes.
0,“And now… those same humans have invaded to kill more of the people we love.” 
0,Ceil slammed her fist on the banister hard enough to tear the skin of her hand on the rough stone.
0,“I am not royalty!”
0,The building tears trickled down Ceil’s cheeks.
0,“I cannot lead you and I will not rule over you!
0,But! I will fight with you and help you send these humans to the abyss so they will no longer make anyone suffer the same pain I am feeling.
0,"Go! Protect our capital, protect our empire!”"
0,"Unable to bear her emotions any longer, Ceil fell to her knees and cried."
0,"The thunderous rhythm of pounding spears and shields echoed over the fortress, but the sound still drowned in the throbbing of her heart beating loudly in her ears."
0,"“See mother,” Ceil’s maid spoke to Chief Advisor Kiri."
0,“I told you she would do well.”
0,The maid walked over to Ceil and held the crying girl in her arms.
0,Together they returned to the city and Ceil’s room to let her rest from her long day and troubled emotions.
0,"Chapter 2
 “The Herald of Calamity”
Ceil"
1,Ceil sat at the fairy council table.
0,Over half the chairs were either empty or held a different face from the original inhabitant.
0,A somber mood persisted where the light of hope had once flared following Ceil’s emotional speech and the march to defend and ultimately retake the capital.
0,"The army of the fairies, as well as those of the asleids and the few dryad tribes who were able to arrive quickly, had been eliminated in a one-sided slaughter."
0,The armies still in route to Amel returned to their own lands to prioritize the safety of their own people.
0,The capital had fallen and the hope of the empire with it.
0,The military advisors who joined the Thorn General in the defense of Amel either died or were missing.
0,"All that remained in the fairy council room were the fairy public officials, Chief Advisor Kiri who lost her husband, the Fairy Thorn General, in defense of Amel, and Ceil’s maid seated beside Ceil."
0,"The news of the fall of Amel was in the past, although the weight of the heavy loss still bore on their shoulders, but a new danger had reared its head like a terrible omen that threatened to snuff out the final embers of hope that lingered in the few."
0,"The young but bearded fairy who had called the council to session addressed the council from the seat of his father, the former marshal of the Gallanvale."
0,"“Just this morning, the farming town of Heivleil on the norther outskirts of the empire was destroyed.”"
0,"“Is there any significance to that village,” one of the council members spoke up from Ceil’s side of the table."
0,“It is where I was born.” 
0,"Ceil answered with a blank expression, not betraying any emotion."
0,"She had fond memories of the small village--her friends she used to wrestle with during the long days of drought when no work in the fields could be accomplished--and the people who lived there were kind, but she knew the fairies expected her to be a leader, and a leader could not cry."
0,"“Precisely,” the young marshal replied."
0,"“From the information we received, there was no warning before the assault."
0,"Like Amel, all the soldiers teleported directly into the village."
0,They could make no preparations.
0,They could not defend themselves.
0,"And, there were no survivors.”"
0,The young Marshal flipped to the next page of parchment and scanned it.
0,"“From the bodies found, many young women were piled in the center of the village, each near Lady Ceil in age.”"
0,Whispers of the council grew around the room.
0,Ceil gripped the arm of her chair to hold back her tears and anger.
0,"Her past friend, Linoa, was likely among them."
0,"Her knuckles grew white, and her fingernails dug into the wood."
0,"“When Amel fell, the manor given to Ceil’s parents was raided, and her family was made a public example."
0,"Given the situation, we can say with certainty that the Tolmyur Kingdom knows about Ceil and is searching for her.”"
0,"“They are following quickly on any leads they have,” Kiri mumbled loudly with her arms folded and one finger tapping irritably on her arm."
0,“How long until they come here?”
0,The young marshal stood.
0,"“There is no way to tell if or when they will come, but there is a direct link between the fairies and Her Highness."
0,Her Namie is a fairy.
0,"I oversee the safety of the people of this city, so I say this in no disrespect to Her Highness, but she should leave the city for the people’s sake.”"
0,Anger erupted in the council room.
0,Voices accusing the marshal’s proposal as treason against the empire fought against those claiming that the empire was no more and that the fairies must prioritize their own like all other nations had.
0,“Silence!” Kiri shattered her slate tablet against the edge of the table.
0,"The sharp sound of fragmented stone echoed around the room, silencing the disputing voices."
0,“This is the fortune that the gods have given us!
0,"Her Highness Ceil has fallen into our protection, and it is our duty, not only as citizens of this empire but also as the nearest kin to the elves, to see that she survives and is once again placed on the throne of the Amelian Empire.”"
0,Those of the council who stood in the preceding argument took their seats once more.
0,"“That being said,” Kiri continued after clearing her throat, “keeping Her Highness in one location is dangerous."
0,We should decide upon a village for Her Highness to move to and then a rotation for her to follow.”
0,The marshal raised his hand.
0,"“If I may be so bold, it is a miracle that word has not reached the humans that Ceil is here."
0,"Under your direction, she revealed herself to the entire army, and I doubt it would take long before they learn that her Namie is a fairy."
0,What of other races?
0,"Should we not move her between all members of the empire, not just between fairy cities?”"
0,“Well thought.
0,"However, fear is a powerful enemy."
0,"Our armies may have faced the largest losses of the allied kingdoms in the fall of the capital, but other races may have already chosen to separate themselves from the conflict in fear of further loss."
0,"If they are in contact with the enemy, they may agree to shelter Her Highness with the goal of turning her in for the enemy’s favor."
0,We cannot tempt such a risk.”
0,"“If you doubt our allies to that extent, then the empire is already finished,” the marshal retorted."
0,“Our best option is patience.
0,We are far longer lived than the humans.
0,Waiting ten or even five years could give us time to gain an advantage in the conflict.
0,"Right now, fear is fresh in the minds of the empire."
0,"So long as we do not succumb to it, we will persevere.”"
0,Nodding heads filled the room.
0,"“For now, we must plan the cities Her Highness will move to.”"
0,"All Vallen cities large and small were brought to discussion, and both benefits and disadvantages were discussed."
0,"Those with insufficient accommodations or lack of protection were rejected outright, as were those with very large populations."
0,"After long deliberation, a list of fifteen cities was chosen with the plan to send messages to the elders or nobles of each to inform them that at any time Ceil may be hiding there unknown to them and to prepare for defense as if Ceil was always there."
0,The discussion then turned to deciding which of the cities should be first.
0,"Almost immediately, three were chosen due to their defensive capabilities."
0,"Before discussion could continue to decide which of them Ceil would go to first, Kiri silenced everyone."
0,"“We will leave the decision to Ceil, and this will be the pattern going forward."
0,Only she and her Namie will know the next destination.
0,"If an emergency arises, they will contact me directly."
0,None of us will solicit communication.”
0,"Kiri turned to Ceil who had been silent for the entirety of the discussion, resting her hand on her shoulder."
0,“You have now heard about each of these cities.
0,"Tonight, make the choice of which you will go to first."
0,"Tomorrow, come to me when you have made your decision but do not tell me."
0,Do not tell anyone.”
0,"Kiri adjourned the meeting with permission from the young marshal who had called it to session, and Ceil was again taken to her room."
1,Ceil walked over to her bed and buried her face in her pillow.
0,"She hated politics, especially meetings like today’s where everyone planned her every action."
0,"Deep down, Ceil understood that these discussions were for her safety, but she also knew that her safety was not important because of who she was but what she was, the empress."
0,She screamed into her pillow and pounded her fists on her bed.
0,"She knew her small tantrum was childish, but she did not care."
0,No one was here to see her.
0,"Even if her guards heard her, they would not tell anyone."
0,"As usual, she was alone."
0,"Tired and out of breath, Ceil rolled over to look at the floral ceiling."
0,"The three cities decided by the council, Yeai, Ofaeth, and Hor, were all small with a population no larger than three thousand but were in defensible locations."
0,"Yeai sat on an island in the middle of a river running through a dense forest to the southwest of the Gallanvale, nearly bordering the dryad forests of Dhuillir."
0,The river was rocky and deep with swift-flowing water.
0,Most of the fairies there could fly and did not need to use the two thin stone bridges crossing the river on each side.
0,The elder of the village was also a veteran of the army and would know how to fortify and defend his village.
0,"The only negative to the city was that due to its small size, Ceil hiding unnoticed would be difficult."
0,The town of Ofaeth was constructed from ancient ruins leaning against a rocky bluff to the northwest.
0,"Whereas Yeai had a primarily Fairy population, Ofaeth was home to many different races of elfkind, so blending in would go mostly unnoticed."
0,It was also the most populous of the three with just under 3000 residents.
0,"The elevation of the town against the bluff gave a wide vantage point that could spot any approaching army, not to mention increasing its defensibility."
0,Hor was the least defensible city geographically.
0,It nestled into the eastern edge of the forests on one side and opened into a vast plain on the other.
0,The forest itself was not too dense and could be traveled with little difficulty.
0,What made it advantageous was the military base located within an hour’s travel that could react almost immediately to any threat.
0,Ceil rolled to her side and grabbed one of her tails to massage it.
0,Everyone from her home village was killed solely for living where she was born.
0,Anywhere she went could suffer the same.
0,“What am I supposed to do!?”
0,"Ceil gripped her tail tight, causing a thread of pain to run up her tail, through her back, and to her abdomen."
0,"When the pain built up enough in her abdomen to become nauseating, she released her grip."
0,“I suppose I do have a duty to save as many people as possible…”
0,Yeai had the smallest population due to being restricted by the size of the island.
0,"If the humans were to attack, only 500 people or fewer would die."
0,"Most could fly, so they had a better chance of escaping slaughter."
0,"Ceil made her decision and continued lying in bed through the afternoon and until she fell asleep in the evening, still wearing the faint purple dress she wore to the council meeting."
1,Ceil was awoken by someone hammering on her door.
0,"Her room was dark, and she did not know how close the sun was to rising or if the night was even half spent."
0,The hammering continued.
0,Ceil rolled off her bed and walked to the door to unlatch the lock.
0,"The city marshal stood in front of her, winded and sweating heavily."
0,Her two guards stood beside him.
0,“We have an emergency.
0,"We just received word that Ofaeth, Hor, and Yeai were destroyed by the humans.”"
0,Ceil’s legs quivered.
0,"Strength left them, and she fell to her knees."
0,"All three cities, in one night?"
0,The marshal grabbed Ceil’s wrist.
0,“We must go.
0,We need to get you somewhere safe!”
1,The marshal pulled Ceil out of her room into the garden.
0,Her guards followed with stern faces scanning for any danger.
0,"Instead of running to the trunk of the tree that would lead them up the spiral steps, the only entrance to the garden Ceil knew, the Marshal led her around the small building to the back corner of the garden."
0,"Behind a row of thriving, deep-green shrubs, the wall of thorny vines rose to create an emergency passage leading down below the ground."
0,Ceil gripped her free hand over her chest as if to grasp and contain her fear.
0,“What about Hor?
0,It has a military outpost.”
0,“Gone.
0,We don’t know the details.
0,I can only assume the base was destroyed or the city fell before they could respond.”
0,Ceil’s heart sank.
0,"Again, innocent people died because of her."
0,"The messages from the council stating that Ceil might be hiding there had not been sent yet, or if they had, the letters likely had not arrived."
0,Those innocent cities would not have known why they were targeted.
0,How did the humans even know to target them?
0,The marshal reached a dead end and pushed against the earthen wall.
0,Dirt scraped and fell from the walls and ceiling as it rotated to reveal steps to the surface.
1,They exited on the side of the city that contained many stone structures meant for residents other than fairies.
0,"If the Humans knew about the cities, and only the council knew what cities were chosen…"
0,“…a traitor…” 
0,Ceil’s voice was so quiet that neither the guards nor the marshal heard her.
0,She stopped and pulled against the Marshal.
0,“Where’s my maid?
0,Where’s Kiri?”
0,“We don’t have time!
0,I need to take you to the barracks!”
0,"In the dark of the night, quick flashes of light appeared all around the city, each brief enough to miss if someone blinked, but the vast number of them lit the city like an intense thunderstorm."
0,"In the place of each flash stood a fully armored minum, dwarf, human, or giant."
0,“No…”  The Marshal’s lip quivered in panic.
0,His grip tightened enough to make Ceil cry out.
0,All at once the city erupted into chaos.
0,Spells of all elements flew from minums and dwarves while the humans and giants used their physical prowess to break into buildings and slaughter the inhabitants.
0,The marshal pulled Ceil away into an alley with Ceil’s guards following close behind.
0,“We need to get to the barracks!
0,Hurry!”
0,The appearance of a portal cut off the marshal and Ceil’s flight.
0,"The two guards stood in front, and the marshal shielded Ceil from whatever might come through."
0,"The one who exited the rift cutting down through the air was a female fairy in a simple white dress, Ceil’s maid."
0,"“Out of our way, traitor!"
0,I will not let you take her!”
0,Ceil’s heart stopped.
0,Her breath froze in her chest.
0,Traitor?
0,My maid is the traitor?
0,How?
0,Why?
0,This fairy had diligently served Ceil as a maid from the day Ceil was taken from her parents.
0,She had saved Ceil’s life the night the royal family was assassinated.
0,Ceil could not believe what she heard.
0,Something was amiss.
0,"She tugged harder to release the marshal’s grip, jostling him, but he held firm."
0,The two royal guards pointed their spears at the maid.
0,"Their strikes were quick and precise, befitting of a guard who once protected a king and now protected an empress."
0,The spear aiming at the maid’s stomach collided with something hard and deflected to the side with the loud ping of metal.
0,The second spear that was held back to catch where the maid might dodge was likewise deflected when it aimed for her neck.
0,“Hold her off!” 
0,"The marshal tried pulling Ceil away, but Ceil resisted."
0,The maid’s glare was a silent dagger.
0,“So you can take Ceil to the enemy commander?”
0,“You are taking me to the humans?!” 
0,Ceil shouted at the marshal.
0,"In fervent desperation, Ceil flailed and screamed."
0,"She never knew the marshal until she arrived in the land of the fairies, but she had known her maid for two years, ever since she was pulled from her home and family."
0,"If she had to choose who to trust, her choice was obvious."
0,"No matter how she flailed, Ceil’s frail arms could not free herself from the marshal’s grip."
0,He was tall for a fairy but still smaller than Ceil.
0,"Despite this, he was stronger and continued pulling Ceil away from where the two guards blocked her maid."
0,Her terror grew with every stumbling step that she was pulled further away until a dark and putrid skeletal hand reached over her shoulder and lay atop her arm.
0,"When its fingers gripped the wrist of the Marshal, large blisters grew and ruptured, and his hand turned black."
0,The Marshal screamed out and released his grip.
0,No one saw the skeletal hand but Ceil.
0,She cried in fright.
0,"Only once before had she seen this phantom hand when she was just as terrified as a young child, when the royal escort carried her away from her friends and family."
0,It had nearly killed the High Elf guard.
0,"She thought it a daydream of her terror as a child and caused by the weakness of famine, but here it appeared again."
0,"In Ceil’s horror of what she saw, she stopped resisting and was grabbed by one of the guards."
0,The Marshal held his puss-spewing and bleeding wrist.
0,His voice hissed through his teeth.
0,“I’m saving lives here!”
0,"“How many of our people have died so far tonight, died because you told them where Ceil would be?” the Namie rebuked."
0,"“If we only lose a few thousand of us, that is better than having city after city destroyed while they look for that peasant!"
0,"By not handing her over, you are betraying the fairies!”"
0,“My devotion belongs to Lady Ceil and her alone.
0,"From the time I took my oath as a Namie, I have forsaken my name, my family, and my people."
0,You know nothing of what is to come or the roll Ceil plays in it.”
0,An explosion erupted on the roof of the building beside them.
0,The wall cracked and crumbled.
0,"A large section of stone fell between the marshal and the guards holding Ceil, and the impact sent a spray of rocks and dust that cut and stung Ceils arms as she covered her face."
0,Ceil’s maid used the surprise to erect two barriers between the guards.
0,She thrust the barriers to the side to push the guards into the walls.
0,She then grabbed Ceil from the pinned guard and ran down the alley.
0,They turned the corner to a narrower section of alleyway.
0,"At the exit, Ceil could see armored humans slaughtering fairies, elves, nymphs, and other citizens who had escaped the crumbling buildings."
0,"Ceil’s maid pulled Ceil back the other way, but an explosion in the building beside them caused it to crumble."
1,The maid created a quick portal to pull them through the wall of the adjacent building to avoid the falling debris.
0,"This building appeared solid, so the maid moved Ceil to one of the corners and told her to hide."
0,“I’ll create a portal for our escape.”
0,Ceil peered around the small room.
0,"In the corner across from her sat two dead bodies, a nymph mother with shimmering blue hair and rare nymph boy not even half a year old."
0,She did not even have the freedom to wonder what a nymph sire was doing in Vallen.
0,"The mother had been run through with a sword, and the boy had been stabbed in the back while crying over his mother."
0,Ceil grabbed her arms and began to shake.
0,"Her breaths grew quick, and she soon began hyperventilating."
0,She stared at the bodies and saw in her mind the panicked and fleeing mother trying to run from a human and dying after becoming a shield for her son against the soldier’s attack.
0,"The young boy ignored the soldier as he cried, only to be run through by the laughing human."
0,Ceil shook her head again and again to try to clear her mind of the image until she became dizzy.
0,“No… I… I can’t.”
0,She ran out the room and towards the door.
0,"Her maid hurried and caught her, pinning her against a chair by the window."
0,“Let me go!” Ceil screamed.
0,“No.
0,You are safer here.”
0,“I don’t want to be safe!” 
0,Ceil stared her maid in the eyes with tears flowing down her cheeks.
0,“I don’t want anyone else to die because of me.
0,The marshal was right.
0,It’s better if I die.
0,No one else will get hurt!”
1,"Before the maid could comfort the traumatized girl, the roar of slaughter ceased."
0,A girl’s cry echoed over the silence.
0,Ceil and her maid peered out the window to see the marshal dragging a young girl against her will to the middle of the street.
0,"The girl in his grasp was a High Elf who looked the same height as Ceil but was clearly younger, little more than two years old."
0,The Marshal stood calm while two giants pointed halberds at him.
0,“Jethro!”
0,A robed human appeared in a white flash before the marshal.
0,"“You were to meet me in the barracks, were you not?”"
0,“I had trouble catching her.
0,Here is the emperor’s wife.”
0,The marshal tossed the girl in front of the human named Jethro.
0,"The girl froze with fear, unable to speak in her defense."
0,The marshal then lowered himself and placed his face in the dirt.
0,"“Please, I beg of you, stop this slaughter."
0,Spare my people.”
0,Jethro walked to the girl and lifted her by her upper arm.
0,She did not resist and stood in front of him quivering.
0,“Are you the late emperor’s young wife?”
0,The young girl hesitated but then nodded in affirmation.
0,"Jethro grabbed the girl’s chin, lifted it, and then turned it to the side."
0,"He then pulled her hair back to look at her long, pointed ears to confirm she was a High Elf and not a fairy with shorter ears or nymph with humanoid ears or some other race."
0,"“I can never tell these things apart, let alone their age."
0,They all look the same to me.”
0,"The girl rose into the air by some invisible power, and her arms were forced out to the side."
0,She struggled but could not move.
0,"Jethro grabbed her waist and tore off her skirt, displaying her nakedness to the laughs and cheers of the watching soldiers."
0,The girl turned in the air to face her back to Jethro.
0,Her single tail was of average length if not a little shorter.
0,"The report about the women of Ceil’s hometown seeped into her mind, the women who were most similar to her piled in the center of town."
0,Ceil struggled in her maid’s grasp.
0,She could not let this innocent girl take the fall for her.
0,She could not watch an innocent girl die in front of her or worse.
0,"“I’m almost done,” the maid whispered."
0,“Endure it.
0,She is sacrificing herself so you can escape.”
0,"The maid’s words only made Ceil struggle harder, cry harder, but she could not escape her maid’s grasp."
0,Jethro reached his hand over and lifted the girl’s tail between his thumb and forefinger as if touching something filthy.
0,"“From what I understand, the girl was chosen as a wife due to her two tails."
0,Am I wrong?”
0,The marshal ground his face deeper in the dirt.
0,Jethro looked back at the eager and lustful eyes of his soldiers with disgust and sighed.
0,He extended his hand and the girl shredded apart.
0,"Flesh, bone, and blood rained down onto the street, much to the shock of Jethro’s men."
0,“Still not concentrated enough.
0,Stability is proving rather difficult.
0,Maybe Emer knows a method to control it.”
0,Jethro turned to his stunned and disappointed men.
0,“Continue searching for the wife!”
0,"At Jethro’s words, the thunderous sound of destruction continued."
0,"He then raised his hand at the marshal, lifting him in similar fashion to the girl before."
0,Fresh gore dripped off him onto the ground.
0,"“For trying to fool me, you will be the last to die."
0,You will watch as we kill every last one of your people.”
0,“Done.” 
0,Ceil’s maid tore open a portal in the air beside her.
0,"Jethro looked directly at the window, having sensed the use of spatial magic, and swiped his arm."
0,"The maid felt the use of Jethro’s spatial magic and pushed Ceil into the portal as the invisible blade cut through the wall, severing the maid in half, and cutting the portal."
1,"Ceil exited, and the damaged portal collapsed."
0,"Her long hair was still in the rift during the collapse, and it severed not far from her head."
0,She looked back at the portal that swirled and faded.
0,"Had she been a moment later, the collapsing portal would have removed her head."
0,"The rapid sequence of events, the gory execution of the young girl posing as Ceil, the sacrifice of her maid whose name she never knew, and now almost losing her head… "
0,Ceil collapsed on her back and wailed out a desperate cry.
0,Her chest ached from her screams and the pain in her heart.
0,"She survived again when she fully prepared to die, when she wanted to die."
0,How much longer will I cheat death?
0,How many more people will give their lives for my sake?
0,How many more innocent people will be killed as the humans hunt me?
0,"These thoughts circled her mind, poisoning her heart."
0,She was a plague to the world.
0,Only destruction followed her.
0,Ceil placed her hand on the side of her head and readied enough ven to shock her brain to death.
0,"“Stay your hand, young Empress of the Amelian Empire.”"
0,"Ceil opened her eyes to see a tiny, light teal body floating above her."
0,The naked feminine figure emitted strands of green ven off her back that appeared as wings of ribbon.
0,"Her fine, light-blue hair flowed freely as if constantly in a light breeze."
0,"It was a wind sprite, a race of elfkind with no government or organized civilization and thus not a member of Amelian Empire’s ruling council despite residing within its borders."
0,"Ceil’s maid had teleported her to the far western reaches of the empire, to Fiorrae."
0,"Another wind sprite appeared, this time male."
0,"“If you die here without the humans’ knowledge, they will forever search for you, and the number of those who die for your sake will only increase.”"
0,"A third, female wind sprite sat on Ceil’s left breast."
0,"“Whether you live or die, it will make no difference to them."
0,They will keep killing your kind whether they know you are alive or dead.”
0,"A fourth, male Sprite rested his elbows on Ceil’s forehead."
0,"“Although, the Amelian Empire is partially to blame for its own destruction.”"
0,Ceil swatted the fourth wind sprite away.
0,“What do you expect me to do?!”
0,The fourth wind sprite’s body scattered like mist but reformed again.
0,He nestled himself on her cheek and wiped her tears.
0,His caress felt to Ceil as a warm spring breeze.
0,“Live.
0,Live long enough to fight back.
0,"If you want to save lives, you must first save your own.” "
0,The sprite flitted up and looked Ceil in the eyes.
0,His gaze felt warm.
0,“You will stay with us.”
0,"“I will only bring you death,” Ceil cried."
0,“Sprites are the elements themselves.
0,You cannot kill the wind.
0,You have nothing to fear with us and have no need to fear for us.
0,"But you must promise, no matter what whispers on the wind you hear, you will not lose yourself."
0,"Darker times are to come, but you have a purpose in this tale, Herald of Calamity.”"
0,Ceil felt a gust of wind blow under her that raised her to her feet.
0,The Wind Sprites led the crying girl through the lush forest to a small hut that appeared to have grown naturally from the trees and shrubs.
0,"There Ceil stayed in the care of wind sprites as the whispers told her of the ongoing genocide in Vallen, the Kingdom of the Fairies."

 “Strangers in a Strange Land”
Sammy"
1,Sammy watched the hand of death extend towards her.
0,"The man who had assassinated an entire royal family, who had discovered how to teleport between worlds, and who had destroyed two Army attack helicopters singlehandedly, unarmed, and in a manner of seconds looked at her with a deleterious sneer."
0,"When she received word from Dr. Shuman of the attack on Gullivan, she had taken Justin and Chloe to the hospital to escape with Miriam, Sean, and Eydis, the High Elf princess that this man pursued, but they were too late."
0,"Eydis, Sean, and Miriam were on the other side of Jethro and trapped in his barrier."
0,"Justin had confronted Jethro first and was shot in the stomach, acting as a shield for Sammy."
0,"He, Sammy, and Chloe would be disposed of first."
0,"She covered Justin knowing full well that her body would do nothing to protect him from Jethro’s magic, magic that could cut effortlessly through anything, and closed her eyes to await the end in terror-filled anticipation."
0,"Instead of pain, she felt sucked inwards, and then an unknown force immediately pressed her down."
0,She could no longer hear the city.
0,The light wind changed direction.
0,The rustling of leaves and branches caressed her ears.
0,"When she opened her quivering eyes, the bloody road full of death was replaced by soft soil and scattered grass."
0,The air was thick and suffocating and made her dizzy.
0,"She tried to lift her head to look around, but her head felt 50 pounds heavier, straining her neck and aching her shoulders."
0,A small whimper rose from her throat and threatened to break into a fit of crying.
0,She was exhausted and scared.
0,Her body felt incredibly heavy and would not move.
0,"The death she nearly avoided at the university, the five miles she ran, the massacre at the hospital, and the inevitable death she thought would come for her choked her mind."
0,She clung to the body beneath her and cried.
0,“Sammy… Where are we?”
0,The weak voice struck Sammy like lightning.
0,She realized to whom she clung and remembered what happened to him.
0,"Finding strength in her panic, she pushed herself off Justin and nearly fell backwards from the immense weight of her body."
0,"The barrier Jethro placed around Justin was gone, and blood flowed free from the bullet wound in his abdomen."
0,"Behind Sammy, Chloe struggled on her knees looking around at the unfamiliar scenery."
0,“Were we teleported?”
0,“Forget that!
0,Justin is hurt!
0,"Oh, God, no."
0,"Oh, God."
0,This can’t be happening.”
0,Sammy pulled up Justin’s shirt and placed her hand on the wound just above his pants-line to hold back the bleeding.
0,What do I do?!
0,She looked around for anything that could help.
0,They sat in a shallow crater with the remains of a single dead soldier and half of another leaning against the edge of the crater.
0,"Aside from their armor and a single sword, there was nothing."
0,“No!”
0,"Sammy pressed harder, and Justin winced in pain."
0,"He was already growing pale, but whether it was from the same dizzying nausea she felt, exhaustion, or blood loss, she did not know."
0,Perhaps it was a combination of all three.
0,“Chloe!
0,We need to stop the bleeding!”
0,"Chloe shifted little by little over to them, unable to find the strength to stand."
0,“I can sear it closed.”
0,Sammy’s chest constricted at such a gruesome proposal.
0,“Do it…” Justin’s voice was nearly inaudible.
0,Sammy shook her head.
0,“The bullet is still in there.
0,We don’t know what damage it did.
0,"If we just close it, it could create bigger problems!”"
0,“How else are we going to stop the bleeding?” 
0,Chloe looked at Sammy with panicked eyes.
0,Sammy realized now that neither of them knew any emergency first aid.
0,"It was never taught in their self-defense classes, and Sammy had never learned it growing up."
0,"Her father never let her do anything even minutely dangerous that would require the need to know it, and when she was finally on her own, she never thought to learn it."
0,“Justin!
0,What do we do?!”
0,"They both looked at Justin, but he only winced with his eyes closed."
0,His head shook lightly back and forth.
0,“Damn it!
0,Why are you so useless?!”
0,Sammy’s tears dripped onto Justin’s exposed stomach.
0,"Again, she looked around in frantic desperation for help."
0,“Someone!
0,Anyone!
0,Is anyone there?!”
0,All that answered was the wind whistling through the tightly packed trees.
0,"Deep in Sammy’s heart, she wished that Eydis was with them, but Eydis was nowhere to be seen."
0,"They somehow escaped Jethro, and Eydis might have been the cause, but then what would happen to Eydis now that Jethro was no longer distracted?"
0,Sammy forced the thought from her mind.
0,She did not have the time to worry about what she had no control over.
0,"Right now, Justin was dying in front of her."
0,He took the bullet for her.
0,Stupid!
0,Stupid!
0,Stupid!
0,"“Damn it, Justin."
0,Why did you do that?!
0,I’ve been a complete bitch to you since we broke up.”
0,Justin forced a weak smile.
0,"She could almost hear in her mind Justin saying, “You were the one who broke up with me.”"
0,Sammy’s hands clenched into fists.
0,Her anger bubbled up until it forced tears from the corners of her eyes.
0,"“When you get better, I’m going to punch you, so be ready for it!"
0,"Chloe, sear it closed.”"
0,Sammy converted her ven into water and found the process far easier than normal.
0,She forced it out as a light stream from her hands and washed away the blood while she wiped the wound.
0,Chloe then pressed her thumb on the wound.
0,"Justin’s skin sizzled as it burned, and steam rose from under her thumb."
0,"Justin did not cry out, but he writhed."
0,Sammy grabbed Justin’s hand and held down his chest to keep him still the best she could.
0,"He gripped her painfully tight to endure the intense burn needed to seal the wound, but then his hand fell limp."
0,“God!
0,No!
0,Justin!”
0,“He’s breathing.
0,He just passed out.
0,I think.” 
0,Chloe removed her thumb.
0,"The skin was brown and leathery with peeling blisters, but the hole was closed."
0,She sat back and looked at the wound.
0,“Did I overdo it…?”
0,"She was visibly shaking, and her face was pale."
0,"The feeling of Justin’s skin slowly burning under her thumb might have been hard to bear, but at least now Justin would not bleed out, or so Sammy hoped."
0,They could do nothing about the internal damage.
0,"“We need to find somewhere we can get help, but…” Sammy looked around."
0,“Where are we?”
1,The portal sent them into the middle of a dense forest.
0,The lush white trees with coiling and interweaving branches were so packed together that visibility was impossible deeper than ten yards in any single direction.
0,It was a miracle that they had appeared in such a small grassy clearing.
0,"The clearing itself was perfectly circular and about five yards in diameter, and although the ground cover looked like grass, it was not a species that Sammy had ever seen before."
0,"Each individual blade was covered in bubbles like sea grapes, but the bubbles were soft and spongey to the touch."
0,"The ground plants between the trees were not as bizarre as the grass, but she could not recognize them either."
0,They did have a mild tropical feel to them due to their large and oddly shaped leaves.
0,"Sammy tried to stand, but her legs shook."
0,She was incredibly tired from running miles across the city and felt that she weighed two or three times as much as normal.
0,"Standing upright made her dizzy, and she fell back on top of Chloe."
0,“You’re heavy…” 
0,The pain of the impact showed in Chloe’s face.
0,"“I am heavy,” Sammy realized."
0,"The weakness of her legs and her exhaustion was not the reason Sammy found standing difficult, or at least it was not the main reason."
0,"When she fell, she felt her body accelerate far faster than normal."
0,"It was a strange sensation that just felt wrong, different from what she had known her entire life."
0,“Gravity is higher here.”
0,An impossible idea surfaced in Sammy’s mind.
0,The grass was some alien species that she had never seen.
0,The trees and shrubs were also new and unknown.
0,"She never spent too much time outdoors and was not one to take time to admire nature, but the plants around them were unearthly."
0,That was it.
0,“I don’t think we are on Earth anymore.”
0,She looked down at Chloe under her for confirmation.
0,Chloe scanned their surroundings and nodded slightly.
0,She came to the same conclusion rather quickly.
0,Chloe pushed Sammy off her stomach and returned to her knees.
0,"“If we are not on Earth, where are we?"
0,How can we find help for Justin?”
0,Sammy tried to stand and felt lightheaded.
0,"With higher gravity, blood was draining from her head."
0,"To test the effect of the gravity, Sammy stood as straight as she could with her arms hanging down."
0,"After a few seconds, her hands and legs began to tingle, the same as if she swung her arms around in a circle."
0,"Her lightheadedness worsened, and she had to lie back down along the slope of the shallow crater."
0,“I can’t stand more than a few seconds without getting lightheaded.
0,Moving won’t be easy.”
0,“Can we at least get away from here?” 
0,Chloe glanced to the side where one soldier and the lower half of another lay.
0,The nearby sword caught Sammy’s eye.
0,It was thin with a deep fuller along the center of the blade.
0,She reached over and picked it up.
0,The sword felt no heavier than what she imagined a thicker medieval replica might.
0,It could have been designed with the weight and gravity of this world in mind.
0,“Is this Eydis’s world?” 
0,"If this was Eydis’s world, then there was hope."
0,Sammy dropped the sword and grabbed Chloe’s shoulders.
0,“Eydis’s world has people who can use healing magic!”
0,She crawled out of the crater and along the grass.
0,The bubbles on the grass tore and released a mildly sweet scent.
0,"Sammy’s nausea vanished, and her heart beat faster and heavier."
0,"Fearing that there was something poisonous about the grass, Sammy pushed herself to her feet to distance herself from it."
0,"She was still unsteady, but the dizziness from before did not return."
0,"The blood in her body circulated better, causing her body to throb lightly."
0,"Her fingers and toes still tingled, but she did not become as lightheaded."
0,She could walk around.
0,"“Chloe, smell the grass!”"
0,Chloe gazed warily at Sammy.
0,“Your eyes are dilated…”
0,“I feel fine.
0,The grass here helps with the dizziness.
0,"I don’t think we should inhale too much, but it can help us move.”"
0,Sammy walked around the perimeter of the perfectly circular clearing to look between the trees for any sign of a direction they should walk.
0,Nothing stood out except in one direction where the trees did not seem as closely bunched together.
0,"If anything, it would make carrying, or dragging, Justin easier."
0,She did not know how long they would be able to lift him in this gravity.
0,Chloe finally succumbed to Sammy’s suggestion and grabbed a handful of the grass.
0,She squeezed it in her hand and smelled it.
0,She broke into a fit of coughing and turned her head away.
0,"“Wow, that’s strong."
0,It’s like walking into a wall.” 
0,"She stood rather easily, having smelled it directly."
0,“Weird.”
0,Sammy looked back at Chloe and saw that her eyes were heavily dilated as well.
0,"“Let’s take some of the grass with us, but we shouldn’t rely on it."
0,"We don’t know exactly what it does, so we should only use it in emergencies.”"
0,They returned to the center of the crater to grab Justin.
0,"Sammy hooked her arms under Justin’s shoulders, and Chloe grabbed his legs."
0,"In the increased gravity, lifting him up out of the shallow crater was incredibly difficult."
0,"Not only was Justin dead weight, now worsened by the high gravity, but the sandy dirt at the edge of the crater also slid down with every step."
0,"Chloe, who was standing in the crater, kept sliding and falling against him."
0,"“Careful not to hit his stomach,” Sammy warned."
0,"“I know, but this isn’t easy."
0,Can we pull him out?”
0,“We don’t know what this grass does.
0,"If we pull him out over the grass, a lot of that stuff will get in the air, and he will breathe it in."
0,"It might increase blood flow, which would be bad if he is still bleeding internally."
0,"He’ll end up breathing some of it in anyway, but we should try to keep it as low as possible.”"
0,Chloe put one foot up in the grass on the edge of the crater and lifted Justin’s legs to her shoulders while Sammy pulled up with all her strength.
0,"With one stable foot supporting her, she raised Justin out of the crater but collapsed in exhaustion and immediately began coughing from the smell that wafted up from the grass."
0,"She sprung to her feet, and helped Sammy carry Justin to the edge of the circular clearing away from the grass."
0,They leaned Justin against a tree and sat down to rest.
0,Sammy shook her head in bewilderment.
0,“How the hell did Eydis survive in this world?”
0,“Eydis was light.
0,"And strong, right?”"
0,Some of Eydis’s odd characteristics began to make sense.
0,"Sammy had attributed Eydis’s light weight to her being an elf, but in a world with such high gravity, perhaps elves evolved to be lighter in order to make survival easier."
0,Even the humans that invaded Gullivan were light and nimble on their feet.
0,The soldier she tackled at the university felt as light as Eydis.
0,She also recalled the early self-defense classes when she was surprised by Eydis’s strength despite being thin and lacking excess muscle.
0,Humans from Earth were ill suited for this world with their dense bodies and weaker physique.
0,"However, she was already exhausted from the events preceding their teleportation here, so that may have worsened their situation."
0,“I guess we will have to see how hard it is to move once we are rested.
0,We should find shelter first.”
0,Chloe nodded and then looked back at the crater.
0,“Should we take anything?”
0,Sammy stood for a better look down into the pit.
0,“Probably the sword?
0,"You have fire magic, but I can’t protect myself with my water magic."
0,It’ll also help cut wood for fires and stuff like that.”
0,"“The soldiers might have something useful on them too,” Chloe added."
0,"After two troubled breaths taken in unison, they hobbled back to the crater."
0,"Sammy grabbed the sword but could not find the courage to search the dead bodies, especially the one split in half."
0,Chloe was uncomfortable but did it without complaint.
0,"Aside from armor and clothing, there was little."
0,"The man had no provisions on him, and his weapon was missing."
0,The sword did not match his sheath so it would have to be carried unprotected.
0,They discovered that the soldier with a missing torso was female.
0,"She was less armored than the man, and she had a small pouch on her waist that held two corked vials."
0,"The liquid contents smelled strongly herbal through the corks even without opening them, but because they did not know what they were, they could not use them."
0,"“Let’s take them anyway,” Sammy suggested."
0,“Someone we encounter might know what they are.”
0,“Okay.” Chloe placed the vials back in the pouch.
0,“We can put some of the grass in the pouch too.”
0,“What about the armor?” 
0,"The woman’s severed armor would not help them much, and the man’s fitted armor was too large for Sammy and chest too small for Chloe."
0,"If this was Whinhlem, there was also the possibility of someone they encountered thinking they were with the Tolmyur army and attacking."
0,And neither of them wanted to bear the extra weight.
0,"“We probably can’t use it, and it would be too heavy."
0,We already have to carry Justin.”
0,Chloe sighed.
0,“I wish looting in real life was as easy as it is in video games.”
0,"They retrieved only the sword, the belt that the mismatched sheath was attached to, and the pouch."
0,"Next, they gathered some of the grass, taking care not to break the spongey bubbles."
0,Sammy wrapped the belt around her waist and slid the sword into it.
0,It hung loose but did not restrict her movements.
0,They returned to Justin and assumed their previous positions of Sammy in front with her arms hooked under his shoulders and Chloe holding his legs.
0,Sammy walked backwards slowly through the tightly packed trees.
0,After only a few yards the small clearing vanished from sight as if it had never existed.
0,She knew that they would never find that location again.
1,"* * *
One hour passed and then another."
0,"The dense forest gave off an intense claustrophobic aura that caused Sammy’s heart to beat faster than the fumes of the strange, bubbled grass."
0,The sense of fear and anxiety choked her in the thick air.
0,Neither she nor Chloe could see any more than ten yards in any direction.
0,"They only followed in the direction where the trees were not as dense, and that path twisted and turned like a snake slithering through the forest."
0,"Sammy feared they could be unknowingly going in circles, but in her sense of direction she felt, or at least hoped, they had not turned enough any single direction for that to be the case."
0,"Traveling in a straight line was simply not possible, and many of the trees were so close together that Sammy, the thinnest of the group, could not squeeze through them."
0,"At one point, Justin moved his head as if he was about to wake but then fell still and silent."
0,Small beads of sweat grew on his forehead and ran down his face.
0,"Sammy felt rising heat from her grip under his arms, and she feared that it was not from her exertion."
0,The cold chill in the air caused both Chloe and her to shiver.
0,"The wind felt like late autumn threatening an approaching winter, and Sammy hoped that was not the case."
0,"The leaves on the trees were still verdant green, but she knew nothing of the plants or climate of this world, so it could very well be autumn or winter or even summer if this world had defined seasons at all."
0,"But on second thought, it should."
0,"After all, Eydis had mentioned that she was born on the first day of the warm season."
1,They paused for frequent breaks due to their ever-increasing exhaustion.
0,"During one of the breaks, Sammy spotted a low-hanging branch, and using the boost from the bubbled grass she risked climbing to the canopy for a vantage point above the claustrophobic forest."
0,The forest was an unending sea of green stretching beyond the horizon in all directions without so much as a hill or valley.
0,"The only mark in the perfect green canopy was a darker line snaking through the forest, possibly a river or road."
0,"The climb nearly broke Sammy, but they now had a direction."
0,Sammy rested for an hour before they continued in its general direction.
0,"With renewed determination that pulled out the last dregs of energy from within, they increased their pace as they weaved through the tightly packed trees."
1,The forest broke open to a gap no more than thirty yards wide.
0,"The trees stopped where the light, pumice-like sand of a riverbank began."
0,"The bank was five yards wide, and the river was about ten or fifteen yards depending on where they looked."
0,The water was clear and shallow enough to wade across.
0,"On the other side of the river, the bank spread only one or two yards wide and immediately became a steep rocky face that stood over twenty feet high."
0,It followed the entire length of the river they could see.
0,It was almost as if the entire forest beyond the river had jumped up in elevation.
0,"Trees grew at the top not too far back from the cliff, and their many roots ran down the rock face."
0,"The cliff itself appeared to have long veins of the soft pumice running through it, and fallen rocks and boulders sat at locations where the pumice had eroded away."
0,A large sheet of rock had broken away into the river.
0,"The river bent around the fallen rocks leaving a small, elevated shelf of pumice and stone that looked large enough for a few people to sit in comfortably."
0,The overhanging cliff was solid rock and looked sturdy enough.
0,It would protect them from rain and wind.
0,The only problem was its proximity to the river.
0,"The air was cooler, but Chloe would be able to help them stay warm by making a fire."
0,This could be their shelter for now.
0,Sammy lacked the energy to travel any further to find another.
0,"When Sammy stepped out onto the sand, her foot sank about six inches."
0,Some of the pumice even cracked and broke under her weight.
0,"Carrying Justin over the pumice was proving terribly strenuous, so they set him down by the water’s edge."
0,Chloe hobbled over to the river and looked at the water.
0,“It’s perfectly clear.
0,There’s no algae or plants or anything.
0,It’s just rocks.” 
0,She cupped her hands and took a drink.
0,A shiver grew from her shoulders and spread down her back.
0,She then held her head.
0,“Brain freeze…”
0,Sammy placed her hand in the water.
0,"It was cold, painfully cold."
0,She was surprised that there was no ice floating on it or built up on the edges.
0,“It’s clean.
0,"Try it,” Chloe assured."
0,"Sammy cupped her hands, and they almost immediately numbed when placed in the water."
0,She brought the water to her lips and drank.
0,"Her body shivered uncontrollably as she felt the heat get sapped out of her, but the water was delicious."
0,"It tasted cleaner than any bottled water she had ever bought from a store or that her father had imported; however, unlike Chloe, her shivers did not stop."
0,"The air was cold near the river, and the water that felt colder than ice was a shock to her system."
0,"She held her arms close and tucked her knees in to try to conserve warmth, but the shaking only grew in intensity."
0,Chloe noticed Sammy’s struggle and wrapped her body around her.
0,Sammy was enveloped in warmth like a heated blanket placed on her shoulders.
0,“Having you around is convenient.
0,I guess I can’t drink the water directly.
0,It’s too cold for me.”
0,"“I can heat it up for you,” Chloe said with a smile."
0,"After extreme effort in their exhaustion, now stronger after giving their bodies a short respite, they lifted Justin to their chests and shoulders and waded across the shallow river."
0,"The water went up to Sammy’s thighs as she sank into the stone and denser pumice, and the cold water was a barrage of painful needles."
0,"Her shaking body nearly slipped and dropped Justin a few times, but they made it across and up to the stone shelf in the overhanging cliff."
1,"The stone was smooth, and there was a layer of pumice in the back, so they set Justin there."
0,"Sammy and Chloe immediately stripped off their shoes and wet pants and set them aside before huddling together to warm up, or at least to warm Sammy."
0,"Her lips were purple, and her jaw was shaking uncontrollably."
0,She couldn’t even speak.
0,“Hold onto Justin.
0,You’ll keep each other warm.
0,I’ll go get some wood and make a fire at the entrance here.”
0,Sammy gave a shaky nod and watched Chloe jump down from the shelf with the sword.
0,She crawled onto the bed of pumice and wrapped herself around Justin.
0,"He was feverish, but that helped warm her."
0,"A single tear fell from her eye, and she buried her face in Justin’s shoulder."
0,Her weak hands grasped his shirt as if his ephemeral life would vanish if she let go.
0,"Deep down, she understood he could slip away at any moment."
0,None of her knowledge was helpful here.
0,None of the business sense she learned from her doting father would save Justin.
0,None of the proper etiquette or tricks to snag a well-to-do man that she learned from her mother was any help.
0,"She was studying biology in preparation for a career in genetics, something her father was opposed to because he wanted her to inherit his trade company, but not even that had any practicality in her situation."
0,It would not help Justin.
0,“Why am I so useless?”
0,She clung tight to Justin and drowned in self-contempt as the minutes passed on.
1,Chloe returned before the sky grew dark and pretended that she hadn’t noticed Sammy crying while clinging to Justin.
0,"Under her arms, she held a handful of dead branches she gleaned from the forest floor."
0,She stacked them near the entrance and set them alight.
0,She then jumped down and carried up even more.
0,This repeated four times.
0,Sammy was amazed Chloe had gathered so much wood.
0,"When they walked through the forest, they had seen little to no branches on the ground."
0,“Where did you find all that?” Sammy asked.
0,“It was just on the ground.
0,"Once I found the first branch, I started noticing more and more."
0,"They look perfectly dry too, so they’ll burn well.”"
0,The way Chloe stacked the wood and stoked the fire showed a practiced hand.
0,Chloe likely had spent a lot of time outdoors or going camping in her youth.
0,Sammy was forced to realize just how much she missed growing up under her parent’s overprotection.
0,"When Chloe was satisfied with the fire, she jumped back down to the riverbed."
0,She returned with Justin’s hoodie in her arms filled with the smaller grains of fine pumice from the other side of the river.
0,"Her pink, burned skin from losing control of her own fire back at the university campus made Sammy wince as if the stinging pain was her own."
0,Chloe dumped the pumice next to where Sammy sat beside Justin before jumping back down and returning with another load.
0,Sammy wondered how Chloe had the energy to do this but then noticed Chloe’s eyes were heavily dilated.
0,“Are you using the grass?”
0,Chloe looked over her shoulder at Sammy while shaking the clinging pumice off Justin’s hoodie at the edge of the flat rock.
0,She then returned and sat next to the fire.
0,"“I felt like I was going to pass out, so I had to.”"
0,“At least we have a fire now.
0,We’ll worry about food first thing tomorrow.”
0,Chloe crawled over and evened out the pumice.
0,They were both exhausted and decided to sleep.
0,Sammy lay closest to the fire with Justin in the center and Chloe against the far wall of the crevice.
0,"The two of them huddled as close as possible to Justin to keep him warm throughout the night, locking their legs together with his and wrapping their arms around him."
0,"Sammy then pulled his hoodie over them as a makeshift blanket, but it only covered their torsos and barely at that."
0,"Justin would freak if he knew that two practically naked women were holding him in his sleep, she thought."
0,Sammy imagined his flustered and possibly angry face as her exhaustion lulled her to sleep.
1,"* * *
A chilling wind that brushed Sammy’s back made her snuggle closer to the warm body that heated her stomach."
0,Her legs entwined themselves in the ones beside her and forced out a single leg that was also hooked around them for warmth.
0,"That leg’s owner shifted at first and became still after a slight grunt, but not before pulling the sole thin cover to her side."
0,A stronger chill now struck Sammy’s shoulders and side.
0,"It caused a shiver to run down her spine, and her groggy eyes peeled open."
0,Her vision was dark and blurry but soon found slight focus on the man’s face beside her.
0,Sammy shot up with a start.
0,The rise and fall of Justin’s chest showed he was still breathing.
0,She placed her hand on his cheek and then forehead.
0,He was sweltering.
0,The fever had grown worse overnight.
0,"She was no expert in estimating temperatures from touch, but he had to be a degree or two above one hundred."
0,She pulled up his shirt to check the wound with the light of her phone and found the skin flushed pink and red around the burn.
0,"A few white blisters had grown near the edges overnight, and his abdomen was swollen."
0,"It looked infected, but she did not know what to do."
0,She bit her lib and looked around futilely for someone or something that could help.
0,"She wanted to call out for help but knew it would be no use, not this far in the middle of nowhere."
0,"Instead, she knelt in the bed of pumice and grasped Justin’s shirt."
0,She buried her face in the crumpled fabric that smelled of dried blood and prayed.
0,"“God, please…”"
0,"Sammy had used the name of god as a curse ever since she was a child, a habit she gleaned from her mother, but this was the first time she had earnestly prayed to a divine being for a miracle."
0,The pouch.
0,"A single thought grew in Sammy’s mind, spoken in a voice that was not her own."
0,She reached over to the small pouch next to their now dry pants and pulled out the vial that smelled strongly of herbs.
0,Why was a soldier carrying a pouch full of vials of herbal liquid?
0,Was she an archer and that was poison to tip the arrows?
0,Or was it something else?
0,Was it a salve?
0,Her eyes flitted between the vial and the swollen wound.
0,"The risk was too high to use it unknowingly, but if it could help, she wanted to make use of it."
0,"She uncorked the vial, and the fumes made her cough and reel back."
0,She held the vial at arm’s length and plugged her nose.
0,The smell caused Chloe to stir and then wake.
0,"She looked over Justin’s shoulder with one eye and saw Sammy place her finger over the small opening of the vial, shake it, and then place her finger on her tongue."
0,Her eyes opened wide.
0,“What are you doing?!”
0,Chloe yelled.
0,Sammy’s face contorted in disgust.
0,The flavor was foul beyond foul.
0,She corked the vial and fought to hold back her tears.
0,"After a minute to collect herself, she managed to speak."
0,“I was thinking.” She coughed once more.
0,"“Damn it… God, that tastes awful.” "
0,Sammy winced and shook her head to collect herself again.
0,"“I don’t think that this is a poison, but just in case, I wanted to test it before using it.”"
0,“What if it is and you get sick?!”  Chloe rebuked.
0,“I don’t think I can take care of both of you!”
0,"“If it’s a poison meant to kill someone, like for an arrow or something, then it should work fast."
0,"I think… I feel fine, and aside from the flavor, my tongue is not reacting to it.”"
0,Chloe looked at Justin’s red and swollen wound.
0,She realized what Sammy was thinking.
0,“A health potion?”
0,“Something like that.
0,"I will wait an hour, and if I am fine, then I’m going to pour it on Justin’s wound."
0,It might help.
0,"If it does nothing, then we are no worse off.”"
0,“Not drink it?” 
0,“Drink it?”
0,Sammy looked at Chloe quizzically.
0,"“Well, in fantasy books and games and stuff, health potions are supposed to be drunk.”"
0,Doubt grew on Sammy’s face.
0,"“Unless it was some kind of antibiotic that can go through his system, I don’t think drinking it would help much."
0,Using it directly would probably be best.
0,"If not, we still have the second one, and I won’t use it all at once anyway."
0,I’ll give it an hour.”
0,"Realizing that the liquid might be safe if ingested but toxic if it entered the bloodstream, she made a small nick on her arm with the sword, much to Chloe’s bewilderment, and applied a little of the liquid to it."
0,Sammy retrieved her phone.
0,The battery showed 12%.
0,Soon she would not be able to make use of it.
0,"When she checked the time, she saw that they had slept for 14 hours."
0,The sky was still dark but not like midnight.
0,The indigo color showed the sun would rise soon.
0,The nights were long.
0,“Let’s look for some food.
0,"It’s been almost a day since we’ve last eaten, and Justin will only get weaker if he doesn’t eat anything.”"
0,Sammy watched Chloe crawl over Justin.
0,She immediately removed her shirt and bra and handed her bra to Chloe.
0,“You need it more than I do.
0,"The size is all wrong, but it’ll be better than nothing."
0,"They hurt, right?” "
0,"“Yah,” Chloe said after retrieving the bra."
0,"“Makes me wish I was as small as Eydis, or at least as light.” "
0,Sammy helped Chloe slip it on.
0,"The band just barely fit on the last hooks, and even then, it was tight."
0,"Chloe was a few sizes bigger than Sammy, but so long as she did not move too quickly, it would hold."
0,Chloe rubbed and stretched her aching shoulders.
0,“Thanks.
0,"If you want it back, just ask."
0,We can trade off using it until we find or make some proper clothing.”
0,"There was no civilization anywhere to be found, and being forced to survive for a prolonged period of time in this massive forest was a real possibility."
0,"If that was the case, Sammy feared Chloe was right, that they would have to make clothing and other necessities."
1,The search for food continued through the remainder of the hour with no success.
0,They traveled a ways down the river and now had to make the trek back to the thin line of smoke rising in the distance from their camp.
0,"“We could try nibbling on the leaves to see what is edible,” Sammy suggested."
0,“Eating random plants would be far more dangerous than you testing that liquid on yourself.
0,Most plants are not safe to eat.”
0,"“On Earth, that might be so, but here…” "
0,Sammy was growing desperate.
0,"Chloe had more knowledge of the outdoors, so she trusted in her judgement, but Sammy could also tell that Chloe was growing weaker at a far faster pace but was trying hard not to show it."
0,Sammy’s eyes were drawn to the cliff face to her right and the veins of pumice that coursed through it.
0,"At some places, the pumice was a bubble in the rock, but for most of the cliff, it ran in thin lines."
0,"As she admired the strange geology she had never seen before, she saw a small piece of pumice crumble from a thin vein."
0,Chloe noticed something slender appear briefly and then disappear into the vein.
0,Sammy and Chloe looked at each other and hurried across the pumice to the river.
0,Chloe paid no mind to the freezing water and crossed to the other side.
0,She placed her ear against the small hole from where the pumice fell.
0,“Something is moving inside.”
0,"Chloe tried to look in, but there was no light."
0,She lit her hand on fire and placed her palm against the hole.
0,"You can’t be serious, was all Sammy had time to think before Chloe shot explosive fire into the hole."
0,Pumice and hot smoke shot out from the vein all along the cliff face.
0,Mixed in with the large chunks of pumice were three long and slender creatures.
0,"They resembled a white weasel but were skinnier with long, thin ears."
0,"One of the creatures was unharmed by the explosion and scurried away along the river, but the other two were dazed with one singed."
0,They began to move.
0,Chloe threw another fireball at them.
0,"When it exploded, it launched them both over the river."
0,"One was immobile, but the third tried to run."
0,Sammy rushed after the injured creature and severed it in half with the sword.
0,Chloe waded back over the river and picked up the singed one while Sammy grabbed both halves of the other.
0,It was a mammal.
0,That much was certain.
0,"It had little meat on it, but food was food."
0,They carried them back up the river and kept an eye out for any more falling pumice.
0,"To their grave disappointment, they found none."
1,"When they returned to the shallow cave, Sammy checked her self-inflicted cut."
0,The skin no longer stung and had sealed together.
0,"She tried to spread the cut apart, but it wouldn’t."
0,“Chloe!
0,"It is a healing potion, or whatever you called it!”"
0,Sammy dropped her dead weasel and hurried to Justin’s side.
0,She uncorked the vial and gently poured half of it over Justin’s wound while rubbing it into the skin.
0,"Content with the amount she used, she re-corked the vial and placed it back into the pouch with the other."
0,Only time would tell if external application would help.
0,"While Sammy helped Justin, Chloe worked on prepping the rodents."
0,"“We’re supposed to gut them, right?” Chloe asked."
0,“You know more about these things than I do.”
0,“I’ve never hunted anything.” 
0,“And I have?
0,I’ll trust whatever you think is right.”
0,Chloe frowned but nodded.
0,She used the tip of the sword to cut into the belly of the long rodent and pulled out the innards.
0,The amount of meat on it was small.
0,She then grabbed one of the thinner dry sticks she had set aside and impaled the rodent on it in a zig-zag pattern so that its body folded twice over itself.
0,She then held it over the fire to cook and burn all the fur off.
0,The rodent shrunk little by little as it cooked.
0,"A lot of air and juice crackled and fizzed from the searing meat, and by the time Chloe felt it was cooked enough to safely eat, the bones were very pronounced, and the rodent was half its former size."
0,"Sammy finished wiping Justin down with her water magic and shirt, taking care not to wash off the herbal liquid, and looked at Chloe’s finished product."
0,She scrutinized it with a furrowed brow.
0,There was hardly any meat there.
0,“Did you burn it?”
0,Chloe shook her head.
0,"“None of it looks burnt, I don’t think.” "
0,She set aside the cooked animal and set the two halves of the second on two more sticks.
0,"Chloe handed one of them to Sammy with eyes stating, “You do better.”"
0,Sammy grabbed the stick and began roasting the upper half of her rodent.
0,"There was hardly any smell to it, and it did cook rather fast."
0,"She watched as air and juices fizzed out of the meat as it cooked, and eventually it looked just as shriveled as Chloe’s but slightly burnt in a few places."
0,She could only sigh.
0,“You take the whole one.
0,"Justin and I will eat half,” Sammy said."
0,"“We should split it evenly,” Chloe protested."
0,“No.
0,I know you aren’t doing well.
0,You’ve been using far too much fire magic without eating anything.
0,You need it more than we do.”
0,“What about Justin.
0,He needs to stay healthy to heal.” Chloe said.
0,“I’ll… take the… half.”
0,““Justin!”” 
0,Sammy and Chloe set down their skewered meat away from the fire and rushed to Justin’s side.
0,"His eyes only opened a sliver, but he looked at them with a grin."
0,“How long… was I out?”
0,“Almost a full day.
0,"Well, Earth day,” Chloe elaborated."
0,"“Then, this… is not… Earth?”"
0,Light excitement sprung up in Sammy’s chest.
0,"If Justin was coherent enough to catch the meaning in Chloe’s words, then he was not as far gone as she had originally thought."
0,She felt his forehead and hers.
0,His fever was still high.
0,"Only about a half hour had passed since she applied the potion, but already the skin around the wound was less pink, and the blisters noticeably shrunk."
0,"However, the swelling had not gone down."
0,"She began palpating the wound as gently as possible, but even light touch caused Justin to wince."
0,"“Sorry…Yah, I think we might be on Whinhlem,” Sammy explained further."
0,"“We are in the middle of a massive forest, and there is no sign of anyone anywhere.”"
0,Justin closed his eyes and exhaled a weak sigh.
0,"While Sammy and Justin talked, Chloe used the tip of the sword to scrape the meat off the bones of the rodent and then broke them into smaller pieces."
0,She set them on a flat rock she heated in the fire earlier to kill any microbes that might have been on it and handed it to Sammy.
0,“Can you eat?” 
0,Sammy moved behind Justin and lifted him up just enough that his shoulders rested against her legs.
0,She then propped up the back of his head with her hands.
0,Sammy provided water for Chloe who used her fire magic to create a thin broth with the meat in her hands.
0,“Careful.
0,"It still might be a little hot,” Chloe warned."
0,"Justin opened his mouth, and Chloe tipped her fingers over until the thin broth trickled in."
0,He coughed at first but was able to drink it down with the meat.
0,This continued until all the meat on his half of the rodent was gone.
0,"During this, Sammy was scraping the meat off the bones of her half with her teeth."
0,“There really is not much here…” Sammy mumbled.
0,“You sure you don’t want some of mine?” 
0,Chloe held up her stick.
0,“No.
0,"You need it more,” Sammy rejected again."
0,"“Eat it,” Justin ordered."
0,Chloe looked at Justin’s weak smile and finally bit in.
0,"They informed Justin of everything they had seen or discovered while he was passed out, including the size of the forest, the strange bubble grass, and the potion they used on him."
0,Justin listened quietly until they finished.
0,"“We can’t stay here,” he finally said."
0,Sammy nodded.
0,"She was thinking the same, but they did not have the energy to travel far in such high gravity."
0,"The food they just ate would help, but they needed to find more."
0,It would not sustain them.
0,“I guess we can find food on the way.
0,We know what to look for now.
0,The animals live in the rocks.”
0,"“We should think of a better way to carry him too,” Chloe added."
0,Sammy opened and closed her hands.
0,"Her forearms, shoulder, back, legs, all of her was sore from carrying Justin, and no doubt Chloe was sore too."
0,“What should we do?”
0,"“We could make a stretcher from some branches and the hoodie,” Chloe suggested."
0,"Sammy readily agreed, but the hoodie would not be enough fabric."
0,“We’ll use my shirt too.”
1,"They immediately set off with the sword to scour the forest for long straight branches, at least as straight as they could find."
0,They knew such a hunt would be difficult with how the branches intertwined with each other.
0,"Sammy had to remove her pants and shoes and have Chloe warm her up after crossing the freezing river, but she was beginning to become accustomed to the chill, or at least able to endure it."
0,"They found two branches surprisingly quick, thick as a broom handle and low enough to reach."
0,Every branch on every tree had kinks and bends.
0,"The two straight branches almost looked artificial, but after chopping them off with the sword, Sammy knew they were part of the trees."
0,"At the riverside, Chloe retrieved the hoodie from Justin and then helped Sammy slip the clothing through to create a makeshift stretcher."
0,"When retrieving Justin, they left their pants and shoes on the other side of the river so that they would not get wet."
0,Justin glanced at the two women in their underwear.
0,Chloe at least wore Sammy’s bra.
0,He quickly closed his eyes.
0,Sammy smiled at Chloe who grew bashful.
0,"“You know, given the situation we are in, we don’t care if you look,” Sammy teased."
0,“I lost a lot of blood.
0,I don’t need one part of me hogging whatever’s left.”
0,Sammy stifled the laugh that nearly leaked out and shook her head.
0,"“If you can joke like that, you’ll be fine.” "
0,"There was no change from the last time she saw it, so she expected the medicine had done what it could with the amount she used."
0,She knelt next to Justin and inspected the wound.
0,She retrieved the used vial from the pouch and lightly rubbed the remaining liquid onto the wound and around the skin.
0,"Justin was still rather hot to the touch, which was cause for worry."
0,"If his fever was not subsiding, then she could not say he was truly healing."
0,"Fevers are meant to fight infection and disease, right?"
0,So maybe…
0,She wasn’t sure.
0,"Once Sammy finished, she noticed Justin staring into her eyes."
0,"She realized she had been making quite a face because Justin’s eyes spoke a nearly audible, “I’m alright.”"
0,Sammy took a deep breath and nodded to Chloe to say Justin was ready to carry out.
0,He winced and nearly cried out in pain with every slight movement of his core.
0,This was another telling sign that Justin was still in terrible condition despite his assurance.
1,They crossed the river and set Justin on the stretcher.
0,Sammy checked her phone and found that it had died.
0,"She should have turned it off when she wasn’t using it, but there was nothing she could do now."
0,She tossed it into the river.
0,It had at least made a useful clock while it had power.
0,"Sammy crouched down at the front of the stretcher, and Chloe grabbed the back."
0,"They worried that in the increased gravity, Justin would be too heavy for the branches, but they supported him."
0,They bowed just enough that their movements were cushioned and did not shake Justin too much.
0,"The fabric held as well, but Sammy’s shirt stretched under the weight of Justin’s butt."
0,"They took frequent breaks at Chloe’s request, and she spent most of them lying in the pumice with her eyes closed."
0,"The forest, river, and rising cliff face looked the same no matter how far they traveled, at least at first."
0,"Sammy initially thought it was her imagination, but after about six or seven or eight hours of walking--she was not quite sure how long without her phone--the cliff had dropped to half its height."
0,The river in turn doubled in width and was now too deep to cross.
1,"They traveled a greater distance on their first day, but without eating anything substantial, they were quickly running out of energy."
0,"The sun was high in the sky, which helped warm the air, but the wind kept its sharp edge."
0,"Sammy felt they would have to stop soon, but in order to do so they needed to find shelter again."
0,“A little further.
0,"If we don’t see anything, we’ll have to camp under the trees.”"
0,Chloe nodded.
0,"She was shaking, so Sammy knew that they were at their limit."
0,"After about a half hour longer of agonizing travel, the river bent softly to the left but then made a sudden sharp turn where the cliff, now about the height of Sammy, made almost a perfect right angle."
0,The cliff ended and sloped to meet the pumice riverside only a few yards later.
0,"Excitement welled up in Sammy’s chest, making it tingle."
0,"In the distance, the forest cleared."
0,“Look!”
0,"Sammy could not see Chloe’s reaction, but Chloe’s voice showed similar excitement."
0,“A lake?”
0,The river met a body of water.
0,"The full size of it could not be seen from their distance, but there was an island in the center, and trees lined the far side."
0,"They did not know if they would find anything at the lake, but the difference in the nearly unchanging forest was a breath of relief and hopefully a blessing for them."
1,"Their pace increased ever so slightly, and they reached the lake before stopping for the day."
0,The lake was about 200 yards wide and about 400 yards long.
0,"Like the river, the bed at the edges was nothing but pumice and pumice sand."
0,The water was so crystal clear that the bottom of the lake was visible.
0,"Much to Sammy’s disappointment, there were no fish or vegetation where fish could hide in the lake."
0,"In the center, a small island no wider than ten yards poked above the water."
0,It contained one lone tree that stood twice the height of the trees surrounding the lake.
0,Sammy and Chloe sat Justin down on the pumice near where the river met the lake.
0,"Like each previous break, Chloe immediately laid down on the pumice."
0,"“Chloe, can I have the other vial?”"
0,"Without opening her eyes, Chloe reached to her side and removed the potion from the pouch."
0,Sammy grabbed it and sat down beside Justin.
0,“You still alive?”
0,"Instead of speaking, Justin only nodded."
0,"He had been vocal three breaks ago when he told them he had to pee, and Sammy had no choice but to help him, but after that, he remained silent."
0,Sammy touched his cheek and found that his fever increased yet again.
0,She pulled up his shirt and saw faint red lines that looked like veins extending out from the wound.
0,The infection was worsening.
0,"She palpated the wound, and Justin writhed weakly in pain."
0,"Tears grew in the corner of his eyes, which hadn’t happened when she touched the wound before."
0,We need to get help immediately or he’ll…
0,Sammy bit her chapped lip to distract her from the pain stabbing at her heart.
0,"She tried to push the worries of Justin’s health to the back of her mind, but they kept eating at her from the dark crevices they lurked in."
0,She took a deep breath to regain control of her emotions and uncorked the vial.
0,“Sorry…”
0,Her heartfelt apology was both in warning against the rubbing she would need to work the fluid into the skin and because of her inability to do more to help.
0,Justin endured the application of the medicine but passed out soon afterwards either from pain or the exhaustion of their travels.
0,Sammy lifted him up enough to slide the hoodie out from under him.
0,She then laid it over him to provide him a little shelter from the wind.
0,"“I’m going to explore the lake,” Sammy announced."
0,Chloe gave a shaking thumbs-up.
1,Walking around the lake confirmed Sammy’s initial observations.
0,"There was no life in it, thus no food."
0,The forest surrounding the lake was no different than the forest leading to it.
0,It was just as dense with the exact same plants.
0,"If they could not find any wildlife, then they would be forced to start sampling plants to see what was edible."
0,"Aside from the forest trees that could provide some cover, there was no natural shelter near the lake."
0,The only thing that caught Sammy’s attention was a large cavern at the bottom of the lake on the opposite side from the river.
0,"Because there was no outlet for the lake on the surface, the water likely drained underground."
0,Their plan of following the river ended here.
0,Sammy finished walking around the lake and stood on the opposite side of the river from where Chloe and Justin lay.
0,“Chloe!
0,Can you get a fire started?!”
0,Chloe raised another thumbs-up and then rolled to her stomach.
1,"By the time Sammy made it back around to them, Chloe had gathered a few sticks from the nearby trees and was stacking them."
0,“There’s not much dry wood here.” 
0,"Chloe’s voice was weak, but she continued working and conjured a weak fire in her hand."
0,She then placed her hand under the stacked wood.
0,"The fire burned well, so Sammy drug Justin near it and sat down to rest."
0,"“I know you are weak, but I will need your help."
0,"I want to climb to the top of the tree in the middle of the lake,” Sammy said."
0,"“I’m getting used to the water, but it’s still too cold for me to handle.”"
0,"“I don’t think I have the energy to swim across with you,” Chloe replied, apologetic."
0,"“No, I will do that on my own and climb as fast as I can."
0,"When I get back, I will need you to warm me up immediately."
0,The water is so cold I will probably only get about 20 minutes before I pass out.”
0,“Are you going to be able to climb in that state?” 
0,“I’ll use the grass again.
0,It might help.
0,"If I can’t climb it, I’ll swim back.”"
0,“It’s too dangerous…” 
0,“We need to find out where we are.
0,That tree is the perfect opportunity.”
0,"Without waiting for Chloe’s consent, Sammy stripped naked and walked to the edge of the lake with Chloe close behind."
0,"“The grass,” Sammy asked."
0,Chloe handed Sammy a single blade of the bubbled grass.
0,Sammy crushed it and inhaled deep.
0,"After a few coughs, Sammy stepped onto the water."
0,She immediately moaned out her stupidity.
0,There was a use of water ven she learned from Eydis that was perfectly suited for crossing the lake.
0,"She had planned on propelling herself across as fast as possible, but she may not even need to get wet."
0,Sammy channeled water ven into her feet and stepped onto the surface.
0,"Her feet stung as if she was stepping on ice, and they slid just the same or worse."
0,She had difficulty standing and hopped back onto the shore.
0,"She had practiced a little with her hands and setting her feet on the water at the edge of the pool in her swim class, but she had no practice walking on water."
0,She coated her hands and knees in water ven and inched out onto the water.
0,"Her core tightened in order to keep her legs and arms from spreading out, and they shook under her increased weight."
0,"Submerging the tips of her feet into the water, she coated them with water ven just enough to reject the water and propel her forward."
0,Sammy glided inch by inch across the water.
0,Why didn’t I think of this earlier?
0,Chloe wouldn’t have had to use so much of her energy warming me up.
0,"The chill of the water crept up her arms and legs, but it was tolerable and no different than the cold winters back in Gullivan."
0,"Foot by foot, she moved slowly across."
0,"Her hands and feet grew numb, which increased the difficulty of not only staying upright but also propelling herself forward."
0,"When Sammy reached about a third of the way, her right hand slipped, and her face hit the water."
0,"The shock of the cold broke her concentration, and she slipped beneath the surface."
0,The bitter cold assaulted her like diving into a bed of needles.
0,"She could not find strength to breathe, and her mind was so numb she could not concentrate enough to swim back to shore."
0,"In panic, she flailed in the water as if she had forgotten how to swim."
0,"She thought she heard a voice screaming her name, but it felt distant like a whisper."
0,Only a single thought floated in her mind.
0,“I’m going to drown.”
0,The thought that this might be her end calmed her panic as if accepting her fate.
0,"Although she could not feel her arms and legs, she was floating."
0,The increased gravity had no effect on her buoyancy.
0,She opened her eyes and saw the island an impossible distance away.
0,How long had passed?
0,Five minutes?
0,Her consciousness was already fading.
0,The water was colder than she expected.
0,Can I still make it back to shore?
0,Sammy turned in the water and saw Chloe only a few feet from her.
0,Chloe’s eyes were heavily dilated.
0,She reached out her arm and latched onto Sammy.
0,Powerful warmth surged into her from their contact.
0,"She resisted the urge to panic again and cling to Chloe, potentially dooming them both, because Chloe was already struggling to stay afloat in her lack of energy."
0,Together they worked to swim back to shore.
1,"Sammy’s frozen legs could barely support her, but Chloe managed to lead her to the fire."
0,She was also naked and wrapped herself around Sammy to further increase their warmth.
0,How many times had Chloe saved her now?
0,"Sammy was supposed to be the water mage, but she couldn’t do anything in the water."
0,Chloe with her fire affinity could have better swum to that island.
0,Sammy clung tight to Chloe.
0,“Sorry… I’m so useless…”
0,Chloe released Sammy before she had even warmed up enough to feel her fingers.
0,"She was still wet, so the wind chill increased her shivers despite the nearby fire."
0,Chloe staggered over to the edge of the lake.
0,She can’t be…
0,"Sammy worried that Chloe had somehow heard her thoughts, or perhaps she voiced her worried thoughts without realizing."
0,“You can’t swim that far in your condition!”
0,Chloe did not respond.
0,A flame lit in Chloe’s hand and grew larger and larger.
0,The heat dripped from it as if it was a viscous fluid and lit small flames on the pumice.
0,She reeled her arm back and threw the fireball.
0,"Every few yards, the fireball popped, spitting droplets of fire into the water below and propelling it onward."
0,It collided with the base of the tree and erupted in a massive explosion that set the base of the tree ablaze.
0,The fire climbed its way up the tree and sent up a column of black smoke into the air.
0,Sammy’s jaw fell slack in amazement.
0,That fire would be a beacon to anyone or anything in the area.
0,They were already too weak to travel in this gravity.
0,Their only hope was for someone to come to them.
0,"Satisfied, Chloe turned and walked back towards Sammy and Justin, but after a couple steps, her left leg buckled."
0,Chloe fell face-first into the sand.
0,Sammy scrambled over the pumice on her numb legs to Chloe and rolled Chloe to her back.
0,"She pulled at Chloe’s shoulders, but she was too heavy to move in Sammy’s numb and exhausted state."
0,She hurried back to their clothes and grabbed the pouch for the grass to either give her enough energy to pull Chloe back to the fire or give Chloe enough of a boost to wake up.
0,"When she opened it, she gasped."
0,There was no grass left.
0,"When they gathered it, Sammy was sure they had about two dozen blades."
0,"To Sammy’s count, they should have only used half of it so far."
0,Where did the other half go?
0,A poisonous fear crept into Sammy’s heart.
0,"When they first left their cave, Sammy was going to take the back of the stretcher so Chloe could have a turn walking in front, but Chloe declined, stating that because Sammy was bare chested, she should walk in front out of respect for Justin."
0,"But, what if she wanted to stay out of Sammy’s eyesight?"
0,"Each break they took, Chloe would keep her eyes closed."
0,"As they continued traveling, Chloe never looked Sammy in the eyes and always had them closed or turned away when she was near."
0,She was hiding her eyes.
0,Chloe was already at her limit after using her fire magic so much.
0,"Her ven was sufficient, but conversion of raw ven to fire ven required the body’s nutrients, its energy."
0,"Sammy knew Chloe was not eating enough to sustain her use, but she did not realize just how bad off Chloe became."
0,"Chloe had used her fire ven unsparingly to help them escape the university, and it even went out of control."
0,She used it in their fight at the hospital.
0,"Now in Whinhlem, she used it to warm Sammy, keep herself warm, dry them off, start fires, and more."
0,"Sammy relied heavily on Chloe’s magic as if it was an infinite resource, but it wasn’t."
0,"When Chloe’s energy ran out, she said nothing to Sammy and instead relied on the boost the grass gave her to power through."
0,“GOD DAMN IT!”
0,Sammy ran back to Chloe and pulled her with all her strength.
0,Chloe’s limp body slid inch by inch over the sand until she reached the smaller pumice pebbles where dragging became easier and laid her near Justin by the fire.
0,There were now two bodies too weak to move.
0,"Sammy was the only one still functional, and she had no hope of being able to drag both of them through the forest."
0,She had no hope of finding food.
0,"Justin’s potion would be gone after the next application, and it did not seem to be helping with the infection beneath the skin."
0,“We aren’t going to make it.”
0,Sammy cradled her knees to her chest and stared at the burning tree in the middle of the lake.
0,The black plume rising into the sky was her only sliver of hope.
0,"Chapter 4
 “The Guardian of the Forest”
Sammy"
1,"The sun fell below the verdant horizon, and with it, the temperature."
0,Sammy spent the past few hours combing the forest for dry wood and branches she could cut in order to stockpile enough wood to survive the cold night.
0,"They had no cover or shelter this time, and with Chloe still unconscious, they would not have her extra heat, just the natural warmth of her body."
0,"Even if Chloe was conscious, Sammy doubted Chloe had the energy to keep up her high temperature throughout the night."
0,Their small camp looked less like a beach and more like a snow fort.
0,Sammy piled the white pumice of the lakeside in a circular ring about three feet high surrounding the fire.
0,Chloe and Justin laid on its inner edge far enough from the fire to keep them from growing too warm.
0,"For Justin with his high fever, hyperthermia was constantly on Sammy’s mind, just as much as hypothermia."
0,"Sammy walked inside the small opening facing the burning tree, which was now mostly a tower of smoldering embers, and dumped her final batch of branches and sticks; final not because she felt it sufficient but because she no longer had the energy to gather more."
0,Her arms shook so much she could no longer hold the sword steady.
0,She barely had enough grip strength to hold the sword at all.
0,Her stomach felt like it was twisted in a knot both from being empty and because she nibbled on a piece of the large-leafed plant found on the forest floor.
0,"It was not safe to eat, and even the small piece no larger than her thumb almost made her vomit."
0,In the end she ended up chewing on the white wood under the bark of the branches.
0,"That alone did not make her sick, and it would hopefully provide some nutrients."
0,"The wood was mildly sweet, which provided shallow comfort against her bitter reality."
1,The night was restless.
0,Sammy feared to fall into too deep a sleep.
0,"In the middle of the night, she tried waking Chloe to no avail and used the last bit of the potion on Justin."
0,She leaned against the side of the pumice pile and watched the tree on the island smolder.
0,She was amazed that the embers never went out.
0,"It continued to glow like a beacon, and the light almost appeared to spread further than was natural."
0,She fought her heavy eyelids and weary headache until she no longer had the strength.
1,Something woke Sammy with a jolt.
0,"It felt like a slap in the face by a tiny hand, but when she looked around, no one was there."
0,The sun had risen just above the canopy and was sending golden rays through the partial cloud cover.
0,Chloe and Justin were still on the ground beside her.
0,She hurried to check Justin.
0,He was still breathing.
0,"His pulse had not weakened, but the infection was visibly worse."
0,"The entire wound was red, and the veins had spread further."
0,Justin’s fever was now so hot that Sammy worried he would die of the fever before the infection.
0,"She doused him with water from her hands to cool him, and the light steam wafted up in the cool morning air."
0,She then moved to Chloe and found her breathing comfortably.
0,"Chloe was not ill, but Sammy still believed she lacked the energy to do anything but rest."
0,About three Earth days had passed.
0,“We might only have a day left…”
0,"Sammy included herself in that statement, but she was more referring to Justin."
0,Chloe would be fine once they located food.
0,"In the back of her mind, a thought rose."
0,"If Justin died, traveling would become much easier, and they might make it to civilization."
0,What am I thinking!
0,She remembered a similar thought back at the university when they were trying to escape from Jethro’s soldiers.
0,She thought about running then and leaving the collapsed Chloe and Justin behind.
0,Is this the kind of person I am?
0,She was both disgusted and furious at her own thoughts.
0,“I will not abandon them.”
1,Sammy ran out of the camp carrying the sword to circle around the lake and head back up the river to find more food along the shallow cliff.
0,"She did not have the explosive power of Chloe, but if she was lucky, she might be able to flood one of those long and slender rodents out."
0,"Unlike Chloe, she could manage the resources needed for her magic using her magic, so long as she kept the balance right and did not dehydrate so much that she could no longer conjure more water."
0,"The moment she exited the camp, she was met by a girl about equal to Chloe in height."
0,"She exuded the youthful beauty of a girl on the cusp of adulthood, slightly younger in appearance than Sammy."
0,"If Sammy had to guess, the girl might have been 17 or 18 years old."
0,"Her dark blond hair was about shoulder length and longer in the front than in the back, sitting just above her nape."
0,She wore nothing more than a skirt made from the matt-brown fur of some animal and held a staff in her left hand.
0,They both looked at each other in surprise.
0,Sammy was about to fall to her knees in relief but was startled by the girl’s expression.
0,That youthful face contorted in a pure and unadulterated malice.
0,She raised her staff and charged.
0,"Sammy could only think of one reason why the girl would be so angry, the tree on the island."
0,It was strangely majestic in its near perfect placement.
0,Perhaps it had some significance to the natives of the area.
0,She dropped the sword and prostrated herself on the ground.
0,"“I’m sorry about the tree, but we needed help!"
0,Please!”
0,The crunch of feet racing over pumice slowed and stopped in front of Sammy.
0,She did not dare look up at the angry native but instead pleaded again.
0,“Please.
0,My friends are sick and injured.
0,We don’t have any food.”
0,"There was no way someone from this world would know English, so she spoke one word in the only language she could think of, Elven."
0,“Please…”
0,The staff impaled the pumice an inch from Sammy’s face.
0,She started in surprise but did not move.
0,"The tip of the staff grew thick roots that wrapped around Sammy’s neck, bound her arms, and rolled her to her back."
0,They tightened around her neck until pressure built up in her head.
0,The girl stood above her.
0,"The fury in the girl’s eyes remained, unaffected by Sammy’s pleas for help, and her mouth spread in a menacing grin."
0,She was enjoying Sammy’s suffering.
0,Sammy’s mind raced to find some way to appeal to the girl who was clearly trying to kill her.
0,She looked at the girl’s blue eyes and her ears that looked the same as Eydis’s.
0,She was a High Elf.
0,"The girl was standing right beside Sammy, so Sammy could just see part way up the girl’s fur skirt."
0,"Two long, slender tails hung low."
0,Sammy recalled at lightning speed in what felt like her dying moments the stories Eydis once told her of the young High Elf girl who was taken in by her father as a wife because of the girl’s two tails.
0,“It can’t be… Ceil…?”
0,The girl’s eyes widened.
0,The staff broke off at the roots in a sharp point.
0,She raised the staff to plunge it down into Sammy.
0,The breaking of the roots eased some of the pressure on Sammy’s neck.
0,She took a quick breath and shouted with her eyes closed.
0,“I know Eydis FeAmel!”
0,The tip of the staff-made-spear stopped just above Sammy’s neck.
0,Tears fell and a whimper broke from Sammy’s throat.
0,“I know Eydis FeAmel…” she repeated.
0,The girl circled to Sammy’s side and stepped on her neck.
0,The spear remained pointed at Sammy’s face.
0,“You lie.
0,Eydis is dead.”
0,"Sammy could not breathe, not from the foot pressing on her neck but from the shock of the first person she found in this foreign world speaking English."
0,"The pronunciation was slightly off, but her words were unmistakably English."
0,“Who are you?
0,Why do you know the language of the sprites?”
0,"Something about what the girl said pinged a memory deep within Sammy’s mental archives, but it was so buried that she could not pull it out."
0,"All she knew was that it was something she heard from Justin a few days after she met Eydis, or it might have been during her first meeting with Dr. Shuman to talk about the minum that was hit by a trucker outside of Gullivan."
0,"Either way, now was not the time to be distracted."
0,This High Elf spoke English.
0,She could communicate with her.
0,"And most important of all, High Elves had a natural affinity to life magic."
0,She could heal Justin.
0,"“It is the language of my home,” Sammy forced out through the tight pressure on her neck."
0,“Eydis lived there with me.
0,"Jethro found us, and I think Eydis teleported us here to help us escape.”"
0,The girl’s expression softened for a moment but then went rigid.
0,“Eydis would not live with humans!
0,You lie!”
0,"The tip of the staff pressed into Sammy’s neck, and she felt the sharp tip puncture the skin followed by a burning pain."
0,“Who are you?!
0,Why are you here?!
0,Did Jethro send you?!”
0,“No!
0,"Please,” Sammy pleaded through her tears."
0,"“I don’t care what you do to me, but please, at least save Justin and Chloe.”"
0,“Why should I save the life of humans?
0,Humans killed my family…” Ceil’s lips quivered.
0,“You humans took Eydis from me!”
0,The staff pressed harder into Sammy’s neck and dug deeper into the skin.
0,"Sammy cried out, but with her arms bound, she could not stop her."
0,“Please!
0,Eydis is alive!
0,She was my friend!” Sammy pleaded.
0,“Lies!”
0,“She told me about you.
0,You were like a younger sister to her.
0,You hated living in the palace.
0,"You did not like her father, the Emperor."
0,You gave names to all the palace hounds.
0,You preferred the bitter black bread from your hometown over the white bread of the palace.
0,You once stole a cake from the kitchen and shared it with the maids.
0,You love the color purple.”
0,Sammy rattled off everything she had heard about Ceil from Eydis despite not knowing if this girl was Ceil.
0,"If she wasn’t then Sammy would die, but Eydis mentioned that having two tails was extremely rare, and so a High Elf with two tails who knew Eydis had to be Ceil."
0,"The staff shook in Sammy’s neck, causing even more pain, but the burning subsided, and it was retracted."
0,Sammy opened her eyes and saw an emotion that was difficult to describe.
0,"There was fear and bewilderment, and hidden inside the complicated expression was joy clashing with disbelief."
0,“You lie.” 
0,The girl’s accusation no longer held the same strength.
0,“I am not lying.
0,"I was with Eydis until a few days ago, but Jethro found us.”"
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“Why?
0,Why would Eydis live with humans?
0,Humans are our enemy.
0,You are our enemy!” 
0,Ceil pointed her spear at Sammy.
0,“We are not with Jethro!
0,He is my enemy too!”
0,The spear froze.
0,“Jethro attacked my city.
0,So many people died… 
0,He killed women and children too.” 
0,Ceil stared off into nowhere.
0,"Her mouth quivered in fear as if recalling a horrifying memory, something she had forgotten or desperately wanted to forget."
0,She retracted the spear and backed away in shock.
0,“Please.
0,Jethro hurt Justin.
0,"Eydis loves him, and he got hurt trying to save her."
0,He’s going to die!”
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“Eydis loves a human?
0,There are humans who protected Eydis?
0,Jethro attacked humans?” 
0,The cogs in Ceil’s mind were visibly jamming.
0,“You are… Are you truly a friend of Eydis?”
0,"“Yes,” Sammy cried."
0,Ceil walked over and touched the roots binding Sammy with her staff.
0,"The roots became brittle, and Sammy broke free."
0,"Ceil jumped back in case Sammy attacked, but Sammy only sat up and held her bleeding neck."
0,"Ceil made no attempt to aid Sammy, but Sammy did not care."
1,She ran to the camp.
0,“Please help us.
0,"You can use life magic, right?"
0,Justin will die if he does not get help!”
0,Ceil followed with caution and peeked over the circular wall surrounding the remnants of the campfire.
0,Sammy pulled up Justin’s shirt to reveal the red and swollen wound on his abdomen.
0,“Jethro did this to him.
0,Can you help him?
0,"You can use life magic, right?”"
0,“This man is… Eydis’s… lover?” 
0,Sammy did not know the full nature of Eydis’s relationship with Justin.
0,"She saw them kiss, but Eydis refused to discuss her feelings about Justin."
0,"Because Eydis seemed to enjoy the affection Justin gave her and even reciprocated it, Sammy felt she could answer in the affirmative; however, she was confident that Justin had not slept with her because of her own personal experiences dating Justin for a year."
0,Whether that meant they were actually lovers was up for debate.
0,"Then again, if she debated on that ground, what then was the year she spent with him?"
0,“Yes.” A small sinking feeling of regret pricked Sammy’s heart.
0,"It felt like jealousy, but she knew she had no reason to be jealous."
0,She was the one who broke off their relationship.
0,“They became lovers just before Jethro showed up.
0,"Eydis was hurt by Jethro’s assassin, so we tried to save her before Jethro could find her.”"
0,Sammy recounted the events leading up to their arrival in this world but left out the details about Earth that would make the story hard for Ceil to follow.
0,"Ceil’s caution ebbed enough for her to feel comfortable entering the camp, and she knelt next to Justin."
0,“Life magic has three schools.
0,Healing is the first.
0,Disease or death is the second.
0,I am of the third school.
0,I can control plants.”
0,The color drained from Sammy’s face.
0,“You can’t heal him?”
0,"“I can use the other two schools as well, but I am not skilled."
0,Eydis is very talented with them but has trouble controlling plants.
0,"She can make them grow, but that is all.” "
0,"After speaking, Ceil’s eyes fell away into another memory."
0,"“If you can do anything, please,” Sammy begged."
0,Ceil reached out a reluctant hand to palpate the wound and then placed her hand on it.
0,She concentrated for a moment and then retracted it.
0,“There is bad blood under the skin.
0,We need to remove it.
0,Grab the sword.”
0,Sammy ran out of the camp and picked up the sword.
0,"When she returned and handed it to Ceil, Ceil held the tip in the embers of the nearly dead fire and then let it sit to cool."
0,Ceil braced the side of the sword with one arm and slowly drove the tip in by the edge of the burn.
0,A stream of foul-smelling yellow pus flowed from the wound.
0,"Ceil pressed lightly around the wound, and more drained from the cut."
0,“You saw the wound swell.
0,Why did you not drain it?” Ceil asked.
0,Ceil spoke as if draining the infected wound was common knowledge.
0,Sammy’s heart sunk into her nauseous stomach.
0,“I don’t know anything about healing people or injuries.
0,I didn’t know…”
0,"“You did not know to drain the wound, but you know how to make medicine?"
0,I can smell it.”
0,Sammy grabbed the pouch and pulled out an empty vial.
0,“I grabbed this from one of Jethro’s soldiers.
0,I did not make it.”
0,Ceil smelled the bottle.
0,“This medicine is made from beiju root.”
0,“Beiju?” 
0,Ceil stopped pressing on the wound and looked at Sammy in disbelief.
0,"“Beiju grows everywhere, all over the world."
0,It is a very common but weak herb.
0,It has a large leaf and thin stem.
0,It is all over this forest.”
0,The plant that made Sammy ill. 
0,“The medicine comes from its roots.
0,It is best when aged but can work fresh.
0,Everyone knows of beiju.
0,Even animals dig it up to eat when hurt.”
0,Sammy’s heart sank further.
0,"Medicine was all around them, but she did not know it."
0,She had less common sense than even the animals of this world.
0,“I will show you.” 
0,"Ceil walked away from the camp and into the nearby trees, returning with an uprooted, large-leafed plant."
0,She broke off the stalk on the way and only held the bulbous root.
0,She then rinsed the root in the river and brought it to Sammy.
0,"She stared at Sammy, but her eyes lingered lower on Sammy’s neck, and the corner of her mouth twisted downward."
0,"“Cut it in half and place the open side on the wound on your neck,” Ceil ordered."
0,Sammy did as instructed and felt a burning sting.
0,Ceil returned to draining Justin’s wound.
0,“I cannot heal the bad blood.
0,"I can only heal the cut and skin and speed the natural healing, but that is… dangerous right now, especially with me."
0,"Most of the bad blood is gone, but it will return."
0,He needs a better healer.”
0,“Is there somewhere we can get help?” 
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,"“The nearest village is many, many days away.”"
0,“Justin will not last that long!” 
0,“Feed him a little beiju.
0,It will help.”
0,“That’s right! Food!
0,Is there anything here that we can eat?” Sammy pointed to Chloe.
0,“She used so much fire magic that she collapsed.
0,We haven’t eaten anything.”
0,Ceil thought for a moment.
0,“There is little food up here.
0,Beiju is toxic if you eat too much.
0,You need to go down to the valley.”
0,She walked over to Chloe and placed her hand on Chloe’s forehead.
0,Chloe woke with a jolt but struggled to sit up.
0,"Her eyes inspected the High Elf girl, and a tearful smile grew on her face."
0,“Someone came?”
0,"“This is Ceil, Eydis’s friend from back in Amel.” "
0,"Hearing the best news possible, Chloe reached out to embrace Ceil but was pushed away with incredible force."
0,Ceil took two steps back.
0,Her breathing was ragged and her eyes were wide with fear.
0,“Do… do not touch me.”
0,"Without saying another word, Ceil rushed out of the small camp."
0,Sammy dropped the beiju root.
0,“Ceil!
0,"Wait!” she called, but Ceil only picked up pace."
0,"Chloe looked at Sammy with eyes that asked if she had done something wrong, but then she noticed the wound on Sammy’s neck and the dried blood."
0,“How did you get that black mark?
0,What happened?”
0,Sammy brought her hand to her neck.
0,“It’s nothing.
0,Ceil thought we were enemies at first.
0,I’m fine.”
1,She hurried after Ceil.
0,Ceil was already making her way around the lake.
0,"When Sammy called again, Ceil slowed."
0,"Her feet did not sink into the sand and pumice as much as Sammy, so Sammy had to run to catch up."
0,“Please take us with you.
0,We don’t know anything about this forest or where to go for help.”
0,Ceil stopped.
0,"Her hand gripped her staff with white knuckles, and a menacing aura radiated from her."
0,Sammy recoiled by instinct.
0,"“I helped you in case you truthfully are friends with Eydis, but I will do no more."
0,I cannot know for sure if you are Eydis’s friends or not.
0,You could be doing this to capture me.
0,"What you told me you could learn from torturing servants in the palace,” Ceil’s hand gripping her staff quivered, “or torturing Eydis.”"
0,Sammy extended her hand but stopped.
0,The aura increased in intensity the moment she was about to speak in her defense.
0,“I hate humans!” Ceil shook.
0,“I hate them all!
0,"They are the most disgusting, evil race ever created by the gods!”"
0,"Sammy knew that humans were capable of terrible, terrible atrocities, and she did not know enough about Elven culture or history to know if Elves were capable of or had committed similar atrocities to those that humans had committed in Earth’s history."
0,"Even on a lesser and more personal level, those who professed to be Sammy’s friends in grade school had taken advantage of her naivety and ignorance because she was the sheltered daughter of a rich family."
0,"When she finally convinced her parents to let her head out and experience life on her own after high school, her first coworkers gossiped behind her back, claiming that she was promoted to management after only a month because she was sleeping with their womanizing supervisor."
0,One of the first men she dated had coerced her into giving away her virginity when she was too scared to deny him.
0,The last man she went on a date with was half a step away from raping her there in his car and then proceeded to stalk her when she refused to contact him.
0,"The defense class she attended with Eydis, Chloe, and Miriam was for the sole purpose of giving girls the tools to defend themselves against those with evil intentions."
0,Humans had the potential to be truly vile creatures.
0,"“Not all of us are like that,” Sammy said."
0,Sammy’s parents sheltered and protected her.
0,"They loved and cared for her and provided everything they could so that Sammy could be happy, even giving in to Sammy’s selfish request to go to a public high school and live on her own."
0,"Her first true friend she met online, Jessica, provided a place for her to live in Gullivan."
0,"When Jessica graduated and got a job at Sammy’s family company at Sammy’s request, Sammy moved to the girl’s dorm and met Chloe."
0,Chloe was so pure and innocent.
0,She only saw the good in people.
0,Then there was Justin.
0,"He was flawed and prone to mistakes, but he never hesitated to help people even when that help wasn’t wanted."
0,"His tenacity in trying to comfort Sammy after a recent breakup was what led her to dating him, even though he turned her down multiple times at first."
0,"After they broke up, Justin never changed."
0,"He took in Eydis, and even though there was a very real danger in associating with her, he ignored it and did everything he could to support her."
0,"Humans had the potential for evil, but they also had immense potential for good."
0,"“When Eydis came to our city, she was scared."
0,"Just like you said, humans are your enemy here, and only humans live where I am from."
0,"After Justin took her in, that fear never left."
0,"When he tried to find a place for Eydis to live, she broke down."
0,She did not want to leave.
0,"She wanted to stay because the humans she lived with were kind, and she did not know if other humans would accept her the way we had.”"
0,The aura of hatred emanating from Chloe ebbed slowly.
0,"“The Amelian Empire is at war with the Tolmyur Kingdom, but Chloe, Justin, and I… we are not from Tolmyur."
0,We do not hate the elves.
0,I love Eydis.
0,She is my best friend in the whole world.” 
0,Tears welled up and fell from Sammy’s eyes.
0,Bitterness rose in her throat and made her jaw tremble.
0,“I hate Jethro.
0,I hate him.
0,"Eydis did nothing to him or to Tolmyur, but he still tried to kill her."
0,"When he found her, when he found us, Eydis sent us here."
0,She chose our safety over her own.
0,I don’t even know if she is okay.
0,I don’t know if Jethro killed her or if she escaped or anything.”
0,Sammy fell to her knees.
0,Her weary head fell limp as she cried.
0,“I’m worried sick about her!
0,I want her here with me.
0,I want her safe.
0,She sent us here.
0,"She should know how to get here, right?"
0,"I keep praying that she would show up, that she would appear out of nowhere… I…”"
0,Footsteps approached in the pumice.
0,Ceil knelt in front of Sammy and dropped her staff.
0,"One hesitant hand reached out and touched Sammy’s trembling shoulder, and her other arm slowly wrapped around Sammy’s head."
0,Ceil pulled Sammy into a light embrace.
0,Sammy’s face nestled into Ceil’s collar bone.
0,Ceil was trembling just as much as Sammy.
0,"Anger radiated from Ceil, but it was no longer directed at Sammy."
0,"“Jethro took everything from us,” Ceil said, seething."
0,"A wave of relief washed over Sammy, and she cried uncontrollably into Ceil’s shoulder with her tears running down Ceil’s chest."
0,The fear and anxiety that Sammy tried to keep bottled up spilled out in Ceil’s arms.
0,Ceil believed her.
0,"She not only believed, but she had also gone through the same fear and loss because of Jethro."
0,"Just as Ceil did not know if Eydis was alive after Jethro’s attack, Sammy did not know either."
0,Ceil could sympathize with Sammy.
0,The two held each other until Sammy was able to calm her emotions.
0,She sniffled and took a deep breath before separating herself from Ceil.
0,"Ceil looked into Sammy’s eyes, the sun reflecting in Ceil’s oval irises."
0,“I will take you with me.”
0,Sammy hugged Ceil again.
0,“Thank you.”
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“No.
0,I would be no better than those humans if I left Eydis’s friends to die.”
0,There was lingering animosity in Ceil’s words.
0,"Her opinion of humans had not changed, but Sammy was grateful that she was able to at least accept her."
0,“Travel will be difficult.
0,That man and… Chloe?
0,"They are too weak, especially him.”"
0,"“If we eat something, that will help Chloe."
0,Chloe and I can carry Justin.
0,We have over the past two days.”
0,"“Carrying him will be dangerous, but there is no other way."
0,Follow me.”
1,Sammy followed Ceil into the forest.
0,They gathered the bulbs of a few more beiju.
0,Ceil removed her skirt and gave it to Sammy to carry them.
0,Sammy was amazed by Ceil’s tails.
0,The skin was smoother than Eydis’s and they were each over three times the length and perfectly even.
0,They swayed with every slight motion of Ceil’s hips.
0,It was mesmerizing to watch and mildly seductive.
0,Sammy began to understand why long tails could have such sex appeal to the elves.
0,"A question came to Sammy’s mind when one of Ceil’s tails swung and hit a tree, causing Ceil to shiver lightly."
0,“Can elves control their tails?”
0,Ceil was surprised by the seemingly random question and placed her hand at the base of her back where the tails sprouted as if becoming self-conscious.
0,"“No, we cannot control them well."
0,"Forest Elves have more control, but long tails get in the way."
0,Shorter is better.”
0,Sammy recalled Chloe’s complaints about her breasts.
0,Larger breasts had sex appeal on Earth.
0,There were odd parallels.
0,Ceil held her fist back to stop Sammy.
0,She then crept forward and placed her hand on the trunk of one of the trees.
0,"A few seconds later, that same long and slender rodent shot up from the ground entwined in roots."
0,Ceil grabbed it and twisted its neck before tossing it onto the fur skirt Sammy held.
0,"“Hopefully we can find two per person,” Ceil said."
0,“Chloe has a fire affinity.
0,"She needs to eat more,” Sammy argued."
0,"“If she does not use fire magic, she will not need more, but if we find more, she can have the extra.”"
0,Their silent hunting continued.
0,Sammy was unsure how Ceil knew where the rodents were.
0,"When she asked, Ceil explained that she was concentrating on any small vibrations she felt through her bare feet from something moving underground."
1,They found nine rodents this way before returning to camp.
0,The critters were far more populous than Sammy had realized.
0,"Sammy laid their haul on the edge of the pumice pile and returned the skirt to Ceil who would not enter the camp with a man present unless she was covered, even if the man was unconscious."
0,She pulled the skirt up and fastened it around her waist with the leather ties in the back.
0,The skirt was just long enough to conceal the tips of her tails.
0,Chloe watched longingly as Ceil and Sammy prepared the meat.
0,Ceil only removed the stomach and intestines of the rodents before setting them near the coals to cook.
0,"“If musdel meat grows too hot, it loses too much moisture,” Ceil explained."
0,“The juices are healthier than the meat.
0,Cook it only enough to eat.”
0,"There was little risk of overcooking with how far Ceil placed the musdel from the coals, but the fur would not burn off either."
0,“Do you eat it with the fur?” Sammy asked.
0,“The skin dries first.
0,It peels off easily when the meat under it is cooked.
0,You cannot skin it without losing too much meat.”
0,Sammy trusted the expert and watched intently how Ceil periodically rotated the musdel to cook it even.
0,"If she couldn’t help Chloe and Justin with her knowledge from Earth, she was determined to learn everything she could about surviving on Whinhlem."
0,"While the food cooked, Ceil retrieved Sammy’s discarded half of the beiju and cut it into long, thin strips with the sword."
0,She placed one of the strips in the blades’ deep fuller and set it over the coals.
0,"After a minute or so, it began to sizzle, and Ceil removed it to cool."
0,"Once cold enough, she removed the strip and tipped the sword so that the liquid in the groove ran down the blade and dripped into Justin’s mouth."
0,"“It will help his blood,” was Ceil’s only explanation."
0,Sammy wished that Eydis was here instead.
0,Justin would be healed.
0,There was no doubt in her mind.
0,But then she berated the thought.
0,That was ungrateful.
0,She needed to be thankful.
0,There was no point in focusing on what Ceil could not do.
0,She was already helping them when it benefitted her nothing.
1,“This one is ready.” Ceil picked up a musdel by its now shriveled ears and tossed it to Sammy.
0,Sammy was starving but reluctantly handed it to Chloe.
0,The next would be finished soon.
0,There were two per person including Justin if they could find a way to feed him.
0,The single extra went to Chloe.
0,"When Sammy wondered how to go about feeding him, Ceil placed her hand on Justin’s forehead."
0,"His body twitched, but he did not wake like Chloe had."
0,This did not alarm Ceil.
0,She began eating her musdel after pulling off the fur using the ears as if it were the burnt skin of a roasted marshmallow.
0,"It slid right off, dripping with oils."
0,Ceil returned her attention to Justin every few minutes while they ate.
0,"Each time she placed her hand on a different part of him, he twitched but did not wake."
0,This worried Sammy more and more.
0,"Chloe woke on the first, but after eight, Justin still hadn’t."
0,"If he didn’t eat, he would not recover."
0,"Healing magic relied on the body’s resources to heal, and it could not heal more than the body alone was able, according to Eydis."
0,“Is he going to wake?”
0,"Sensing the worry in Sammy’s voice, Ceil gave an assuring nod."
0,She pointed to different points on her head and chest.
0,“There are wells of energy in the body at different locations.
0,Activating them can temporarily increase vitality and the flow of ven in the body.”
0,"Ceil drew lines with her finger from point to point, and the movements looked very familiar."
0,They nearly matched what Eydis taught in her self-defense class.
0,"When Chloe was first able to feel the ven in her body, Eydis had Chloe follow those motions to move the ven around to her hand."
0,"The order was different, but Ceil still hit many of the same points."
0,"Sammy repeated the motions she learned from Eydis, although sitting instead of standing."
0,Ceil watched with amazement.
0,“Eydis taught me this.
0,It’s how I first learned to control my ven.”
0,Ceil smiled.
0,"“These well points are something taught among elves for training or use in medicine, something we learned long ago from Bydrofe, the Guardian of Whinhlem."
0,"Most races do not believe in them, or if they do, they ignore them or have other methods.”"
0,"In other words, Sammy would have had to learn it from an elf."
0,She would not have learned it as a human of Tolmyur.
0,This was further evidence that Sammy knew Eydis.
1,"Ceil continued activating Justin’s well points throughout the day, and Justin finally woke by the time the sun was setting."
0,"Sammy tried to introduce Ceil, but he was not coherent enough to understand her."
0,With great difficulty they fed him and then let him sleep again.
0,"By the time the sun set, Chloe was able to stand and walk around, but she was still weak."
0,Ceil offered to wait with them one more day before heading out.
0,"Now that they had some meat in their stomachs, Ceil added small amounts of beiju to their meals."
0,"When grilled over a fire, the root tasted like asparagus, but it left a numbing feeling in Sammy’s mouth."
1,"The following day, Chloe was as active as Sammy, so Sammy returned her bra to Chloe."
0,"They gave Chloe the largest portions of the food, because her fire magic would be useful."
0,Ceil was surprised that not only Chloe but also Sammy became hungry rather quickly.
0,"Ceil could make do with two or three light meals a day, but Sammy and Chloe needed five or six."
0,Sammy and Ceil had to travel deeper and deeper into the forest to find enough food.
0,The meat was simply not that filling.
0,It was spongey and juicy but had little substance.
0,"Beiju was heavier, but they could not eat too much of it without becoming sick."
0,Sammy and Chloe were just barely managing.
0,"It felt to Sammy like snacking lightly throughout the day without ever eating any substantial meal, hardly sufficient to sate her hunger."
1,"Justin woke up again around midday, so they were able to feed him, but like the first time, he was not coherent."
0,"His fever had decreased after Ceil drained the wound, but it returned in full force by evening."
0,They could wait no longer.
0,"“We leave at first light tomorrow,” Ceil announced."
0,They spent the rest of the day preparing.
0,They caught a few more musdel and anchored them underwater in the lake to preserve them until morning.
0,"When Sammy and Chloe were reassembling the stretcher with Sammy’s shirt and Justin’s hoodie, Ceil stopped them."
0,"She touched the branches, and root-like shoots sprouted from them and intertwined with each other to create a mesh hammock."
0,"Sammy and Chloe were both amazed, and Sammy was glad that she would no longer have to walk around shirtless."
0,She was not embarrassed showing her skin.
0,The wind was simply cold.
1,Night fell and then morning came.
0,"While Chloe and Sammy chatted idly, Ceil leaned the stretcher against the pile of pumice and sat in it to assess its strength."
0,She nestled in and after a moment and nodded.
0,“Is it comfortable?” Sammy asked.
0,“Do you want to try?”
0,Sammy walked over and pulled Ceil out.
0,She then sat in and leaned back.
0,"The roots dug into her back and legs a little, but it was tolerable."
0,One of the roots snapped and then another.
0,"Sammy shifted a little, and then the mesh broke."
0,“How much do you weigh?” Ceil asked in bewilderment.
0,“You should not be much heavier than me.”
0,"Ceil was taller than Sammy by half a foot and had tails, but she was also thinner and nowhere near as endowed."
0,"All things considered, their weights should not have been that different by appearance alone."
0,Sammy stood and looked at the destroyed stretcher.
0,She couldn’t even apologize.
0,"If anything, she was grateful it had broken when she was in it instead of Justin."
0,She knew she was heavy in this world.
0,"Ceil was not aware of the difference between people of Earth and those of Whinhlem, and Sammy avoided stating that they were from another world."
0,“Justin is heavier than me.
0,It wouldn’t have held him.
0,Can you fix it?”
0,"“Not with those branches,” Ceil explained."
0,“They have no life remaining in them.
0,I used it all to make the net.”
0,"Just like with healing, life magic could not create growth beyond the nutrient levels of the plant, and those branches were cut from their trees two days ago."
0,Sammy sighed and picked up the sword.
0,"“I broke it, so I’ll chop new branches.”"
0,“Wait.” Ceil followed Sammy and left Chloe in the camp to watch Justin and the fire.
1,They reached the edge of the forest where Ceil placed her hand on one of the trees.
0,Two parallel branches began to grow.
0,Thick roots sprouted between them and knotted together.
0,"Unlike the mesh from before, the woven roots looked more like a coarse fabric than a net."
0,The trunk where Ceil placed her hand turned black.
0,"Ceil quickly retracted her hand, almost fearful."
0,She was shaking and sweating.
0,Sammy recognized the symptoms.
0,“How much ven did you use?”
0,Ceil sat down and took a few deep breaths as she looked up at her work.
0,"“I do not have much ven, and growth uses a lot."
0,Controlling that growth uses even more.
0,That took all the ven my body would give me.
0,I dared not go further.”
0,Sammy got to work chopping the branches off the tree and together they carried the new stretcher back to camp.
1,"Using Chloe who was heavier than Justin, they made sure that the stretcher was strong enough to carry him."
0,"There was still plenty of life left in the branches, so Ceil could further strengthen or repair the stretcher if needed when she recovered her ven."
0,"They pulled the frozen musdel from the lake, set Justin on the stretcher, and departed."
0,Ceil led the way with Sammy holding the front of the stretcher and Chloe in back.
1,They walked to the far side of the lake where Sammy found the underwater cave and turned to enter the forest.
0,"Like the rest of the forest, the trees were close together."
0,Sammy was sure she would have gotten lost without a direction.
0,“How do you know where to go?” Sammy asked Ceil.
0,“The ground is cooler where the river flows underground.
0,Your odd footwear prevents you from noticing.
0,"If we go in the wrong direction, the ground warms."
0,I am simply following where it is cold.”
0,“Where does the river lead?” Chloe asked next.
0,“We will only be following the river until we reach the cliff.
0,You will see.”
0,Sammy trusted Ceil’s sense of direction.
0,"After all, Ceil had found her way to them through the forest."
1,“We are nearly there.
0,Do you hear it?” Ceil asked.
0,"Sammy and Chloe looked around and sharpened their ears, but they did not hear anything more than the wind through the trees."
0,"“Elves must have better hearing than humans,” Chloe replied."
0,"“You will hear it,” Ceil reassured."
0,"Sure enough, after a few more minutes of walking, Sammy heard rumbling."
0,It sounded like flowing water but much more forceful.
0,"She could not figure out what the sound was, but then Chloe figured it out."
0,“A waterfall!”
0,"The dense forest grew lighter, and the trees thinned."
0,Sammy could only see sky in the slivers of light through the tree trunks.
1,"When they exited the forest, Sammy had to make a conscious effort not to drop Justin."
0,"Her mouth held slack, and tears fell from her eyes."
0,Before her was a scene that could only be described as paradisiacal.
0,"The forest appeared to extend on forever when Sammy peered through the branches of the tree she climbed days ago, but what she had assumed was the horizon was actually the edge of a massive plateau."
0,Several other perfectly flat-topped plateaus covered with a layer of green trees towered hundreds and hundreds of feet from the forest floor.
0,"None of them were quite as tall as the one they stood on, and a few in the distance had collapsed and lay in heaps on the valley floor."
0,"A waterfall cascaded down the cliff from their plateau about twenty feet below them, and similar waterfalls fell from the other plateaus into rivers that snaked through the densely forested valley, their mist creating rainbows in the morning sun."
0,"Unlike the trees that coated the tops of the plateaus in a near perfect layer of green, the forest of the valley contained a wide variety of different shades and shapes."
0,Huge mossy vines stretched between the tallest trees.
0,The largest of which that appeared sturdy enough to walk across had plants growing along them.
0,The trees that flooded the forest valley splashed up onto the bases of the plateaus as if attempting to climb the steep slopes.
0,"Small patches of grassland dotted the forest, and specs of wildlife could be seen moving in them."
0,"“Welcome to Fiorrae, land of the wind sprites."
0,The sprites gave me stewardship over this forest as its guardian.” Ceil stabbed her staff into the ground and sat down near the edge of the cliff after removing the tied musdel from her shoulder.
0,“We break here.
0,You will need your energy climbing down.”
0,"Chapter 5
 “A Bet with the Wind Sprites”
Sammy"
1,“Are we really going to have to climb down?” Chloe sat furthest from the cliff.
0,"When her eyes shifted towards the edge and out into the open expanse, they shot back to the dirt at her feet."
0,“Are you afraid of heights?” Sammy asked.
0,"“I’m not… well… A little, yah.”"
0,"This was something Sammy had not known about her friend of two years, although they had no opportunities for her fear to show until now."
0,"The tallest building on campus was twelve floors, but Dr. Shuman’s office was only on the seventh."
0,"If she stuck to the halls, she would not need to look out a window."
0,"Of course, being indoors would be more comfortable than standing on a thousand-foot or higher cliff."
0,"“We will not be climbing straight down,” Ceil explained, much to Chloe’s relief."
0,"“Although, that would be faster."
0,Your cargo makes that option impossible.
0,We will follow fissures along the cliff side.
0,We should be able to reach my hut before sunset.”
0,"Sammy gazed out at the sister plateaus and saw dark, thin, zig-zagging shadows along the cliff faces."
0,They looked not all too dissimilar from the cracks filled with pumice on the short ridge running along the river only on a far grander scale.
0,"If they were visible at this distance, they would be large enough for someone to walk in."
0,"Such large fissures of pumice would drastically weaken the stability of the plateaus, and that may have been the reason some of them collapsed over the ages."
0,"“Although I say that,” Ceil continued, “the nearest fissure is still a short distance down the cliff, so we will need to climb down at least that much.”"
0,"“You’re kidding, right?” Chloe grew horrified."
0,Ceil’s eyebrows furrowed.
0,“Do I have any reason to lie to you?”
0,Chloe glanced once again at the cliff’s edge but immediately looked back at the ground.
0,"She shook her head and whispered, “I can’t…”"
0,Ceil sighed.
0,"“The roots of the trees near the edge make climbing down far easier and faster, but if you are absolutely against it, the fissure should reach the surface not too far from this waterfall.”"
0,"The tension holding Chloe rigid released, and she collapsed into her lap with a heavy exhale."
0,“Thank goodness.”
1,The roar of the waterfall sounded faint in the distance.
0,They followed the edge of the plateau for what felt like two hours or maybe three.
0,Ceil brought them to a large crack in the ground that was big enough for a grown person to slide into without much trouble.
0,“This is the entrance.
0,"It is small here, but it grows larger on the inside.” "
0,"Ceil climbed down first, and with a nimble hop, she disappeared from view."
0,Sammy was next.
0,She sat down and hung her legs into the crack.
0,"Inching forward, she slid inside."
0,“Wah!!”
0,There was a sudden drop of about five feet.
0,"The impact jarred her knees, and she stumbled forward into Ceil who was crouching to keep her head from touching the top of the crevice."
0,The crevice was only about four and a half feet tall.
0,"To their right, the crevice opened into nothing but air only a few feet away."
0,"So long as Chloe did not look to the right, Sammy felt there would be no problem."
0,“Send Justin next!” Sammy called.
0,"Chloe slid Justin into the crack, and both Sammy and Ceil worked together to lower him down."
0,The stretcher then followed.
0,"After they finished, Chloe slid herself in."
0,"Sammy forgot to warn her about the sudden drop, so Chloe fell with an even louder shriek than Sammy, and Sammy had to catch her to keep her from stumbling into Justin."
0,"“That was not so bad, was it,” Sammy said with a chuckle."
0,"Chloe clung to Sammy with tight, sweaty fingers."
0,"Sammy ignored the pain of Chloe’s grip and smiled, enjoying this new side of her friend."
0,“Take the back.
0,I’ll stay in front.”
0,"After prying Chloe off, they picked up Justin and followed Ceil back in the direction of the waterfall."
1,The rock was flat yet course and provided good traction.
0,The inside of the crevice to their right was a wall of pumice as Sammy expected.
0,It was the same as what she saw along the river.
0,"By the time they crossed under the waterfall, the size of the crevice increased to about ten feet high and six to eight feet wide."
0,"The trees atop the plateau grew closer to the edge near the waterfall, and their roots fell like a tangled blanket over the edge so thick that little mist passed through."
0,Chloe was able to walk comfortably behind their shield against the open air.
0,"Sudden drops in the crevice appeared a few times, but each drop was no more than three to five feet, and with how large the crevice was, jumping down and lowering Justin was simple."
0,“Glad we don’t have to climb?”
0,Sammy looked back over her shoulder at Chloe who kept her eyes on her feet now that they passed the waterfall and root barrier.
0,"Chloe did not answer, and Sammy chuckled again."
1,"The crevice reversed direction switching back under them, which meant that there was a larger drop than any previous."
0,Ceil slid down the fifteen-foot slope of eroded pumice on the inner side of the crevice and beckoned Sammy to slide down next.
0,"After a deep breath, Sammy placed her back against the pumice and inched to the side."
0,"Once the strong gravity took hold, she shot down the rocky sand and into Ceil who caught her before she could slide out the crevice into open air."
0,"Following the same routine, Chloe slid Justin down followed by his stretcher, leaving her alone at the top."
0,"“It’s not that bad, so long as we catch you before you fall to your death.”"
0,“Sammy! You’re not helping!”
0,Chloe stepped out but quickly retracted her foot.
0,She sat down and leaned into the pumice but quickly scooted away.
0,Her hesitation repeated over and over again.
0,"Each time, Chloe would look down at where Ceil and Sammy stood and saw the hundreds of feet of open air where the edge of the crevice ended."
0,"“This is pathetic,” Ceil spat “Move that man away.”"
0,"Ceil gripped her staff and shot up the pumice wall with incredible speed, stabbing her staff in to increase leverage and traction."
0,"When she reached Chloe, she grabbed Chloe’s arm and yanked her down."
0,Chloe screamed the entire slide.
0,"Due to the combined weight of two people, they did not stop sliding until about a foot from the edge."
0,Ceil used her staff to brake or they would have easily slid over.
0,Chloe scampered towards Sammy and leaned against the pumice on the inside of the crevice.
0,Ceil breathed an exasperated sigh.
0,“We can take a short break.”
1,Descending the plateau took what felt like five or more hours.
0,The constant breaks not only to help Chloe collect herself but also to give her and Sammy a rest from carrying Justin drastically increased the time Ceil presumed they would take.
0,Chloe was able to breathe a sigh of relief when the leaves atop the first tree popped up from the cliff-side.
1,"After another hour, the slope of the cliff was shallow enough for them to step out into the forest."
0,"Unlike the top of the plateau, the trees here were large, broad-leafed, and spread well enough apart that two of Justin’s stretchers could fit lengthwise between them."
0,"Large, moss-covered boulders littered the ground, some as large as a house."
0,"This created beautifully picturesque scenery any direction Sammy looked that she could imagine being used for postcards or calendars, but the uneven ground made carrying Justin difficult."
0,The calls of various animals that Sammy had never heard floated among the trees with the faint breeze.
0,"Not far into the forest, Sammy noticed a single large bird looking down at them from the low branch of a tree."
0,"It was similar to a four or five foot tall hawk but with cobalt-blue, almost tropical looking plumage that had a slight metallic sheen."
0,"Two long, jagged yellow feathers sprouted from its head and ran down its back."
0,The way it cocked its head and widened one eye at Sammy’s quizzical gaze almost hinted at an advanced level of intelligence for an animal.
0,At least that was what it felt like to Sammy.
0,"“Do not do anything to annoy those birds,” Ceil warned."
0,"“They think this forest is theirs, and they will gather numbers to run you out or kill you if they feel you mean trouble.”"
0,“What are they called?” Chloe asked.
0,“I am not sure.
0,They might not have a name.
0,You can ask the wind sprites when we arrive.
0,"I was planning on resting here, but there are four of them watching us.”"
0,Sammy looked back at the strange bird and bowed her head lightly.
0,"The bird bowed back and smiled, or what Sammy could only think was a smile."
0,The feathers on the sides of its head rose slightly.
0,Could birds smile?
0,"While Sammy pondered whether human emotion could even be applied to birds, the large bird raised its wings and shot up through the canopy in one powerful flap."
0,Sammy felt the gust created from its ascent and then four more as the other birds left.
0,“There were five?
0,"I could only see that one,” Sammy said."
0,“They are smart enough to keep out of sight.
0,They know me and must have been curious of you.
0,"If they disliked you, we would have been in trouble."
0,"I could probably fight off two of the smaller ones, but five would be impossible, especially with the two-plumed one here.”"
0,“Are they that dangerous?” Chloe asked.
0,"“They can use wind magic,” Ceil explained."
0,"“Now that they’re gone, can we take a break?"
0,"My back is killing me,” Chloe whined."
0,"“I could use one too,” Sammy said but then changed her mind."
0,"“No, I can go longer."
0,"If you want to switch with Chloe, we can keep going.”"
0,"“I would rather not carry him,” Ceil said."
0,“We will rest.”
1,"At the next clearing with soft underbrush, Sammy and Chloe sat Justin down."
0,"While Chloe leaned back against a boulder to rest, Sammy helped Ceil check up on Justin."
0,"Some of the swelling went down now that the wound had been drained, but the surface did not improve."
0,Ceil walked away for a moment and returned with a beiju root.
0,She cut it with the sword and placed the cut end on top of the wound.
0,"The other half was diced and boiled by Chloe, and then slowly dripped into Justin’s mouth."
0,“You really can’t heal him with your life magic?” Sammy asked.
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“I can only trust using healing magic on myself.
0,"My skill in healing is no better than what beiju can do, and it might end badly.” "
0,Ceil glanced at Sammy’s neck.
0,"“If I had to pick one, I would use beiju and save my ven.”"
0,Sammy gritted her teeth in frustration.
0,“How much longer is it going to take to get him help?”
0,“You could always leave him behind.
0,I cannot guarantee he will survive until you find him help.”
0,“There is no way I could do that.” 
0,Ceil shrugged.
0,"Her indifference to Justin’s life rubbed Sammy wrong, but Sammy could not say anything against her for it."
0,"After all, Ceil was helping treat him."
1,"Once Chloe said she was ready to continue, they set off."
0,They quickly reached a river running through the valley and followed it downstream.
0,"“We should reach my home by nightfall at our current pace,” Ceil said with mild annoyance."
1,"After a few more hours of walking, they stopped to rest."
0,Ceil bent over the river’s edge and drank from her cupped hands.
0,"Chloe did likewise, and Sammy could only stare in awe."
0,“How can you drink that water?
0,"It’s way too cold,” Sammy said."
0,"“Cold?” Ceil looked perplexed, but then her eyebrows raised when the realization hit her."
0,"“I have been living here for a time, so I do it out of reflex.” "
0,"Sammy was about to ask what she was doing, but Ceil continued."
0,“The water was the same for me at first.”
0,“At first?
0,And you can handle it now?
0,Did you just get used to it?
0,I’ve been having Chloe heat it for me or creating my own water to drink.”
0,Ceil looked over at Chloe.
0,“You’ve been heating it this whole time?
0,I assumed that because you are more skilled with magic you would have realized.”
0,“Realized what?” Now Chloe was confused.
0,Both Sammy and Chloe pressed Ceil for an explanation.
0,“I would have thought that recognizing ven would be the first thing Eydis taught you.”
0,“She did.
0,"We learned to recognize our ven,” Sammy said."
0,"“No, not your own ven, the ven in nature,” Chloe clarified."
0,"Sammy recalled Eydis’s explanation of how ven could be found not only in people but also in the air, plants, animals, and even rocks."
0,"“Everything in Fiorrae is saturated with ven, which makes it different than what you would find outside the forest."
0,The trees and ground have odd characteristics.
0,"Although I would not like to admit it, I could only create the bed you are carrying that man in because the trees have much more life in them than normal, and the saturation makes that life easier to manipulate."
0,I could not have created that outside this forest.
0,I am not that strong in life magic yet.”
0,Sammy’s eyes shifted to Justin.
0,That was why she could manipulate the trees to that extent but couldn’t heal him.
0,“Then that water?”
0,"“Yes, the enriched water is colder than ice but does not freeze because of the ven in it."
0,"For someone with a water affinity, absorbing the ven would make it safe to drink."
0,"I cannot use water magic, so I replace the ven in the water with my own, forcing it out.”"
0,"After hearing Ceil’s explanation, Sammy crawled to the river’s edge and lifted out some water with her cupped hand."
0,"The water was freezing cold as expected, and the longer she held it, the number her hand became."
0,"She did not know how to absorb ven, but she did know how to infuse her ven into something."
0,Sammy recalled her training with the cotton balls where she was instructed to infuse them with ven without her ven making them wet.
0,"“But if I do that normally, I will repel the water."
0,"If I infuse it with the goal of keeping it wet,” Sammy thought out loud."
0,Slowly the water in her hand warmed.
0,"She sipped it from her hand and did not feel any chill, but with that small amount of water, there was no way to tell if this was because of her own ven or her body heat."
0,She cupped a larger amount of water with both hands and tried again.
0,"The water warmed in an instant, but it still felt like a refreshing ice-cold glass of water."
0,“Can you drink it now?
0,"If not, I’m still fine with heating it for you,” Chloe offered."
0,"“Nah, I got it."
0,"Ceil, thanks for the explanation.”"
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“Why is this forest so saturated with ven?” Chloe asked.
0,Ceil rotated her hand back and forth in an unfamiliar gesture.
0,“I am not sure.
0,All I know is that the sprites live here because it is saturated.
0,"They are a race of elementals, and elementals only live in ven-rich environments.”"
0,Ceil stood and removed her staff she had impaled in the ground.
0,"Having witnessed it a few times now, Sammy noticed a few small roots break off the staff."
0,“Are you ready to go?”
1,The sun setting on the horizon painted the huge plateaus jutting from the forest in an amber glow.
0,"Their shadows stretched over the valley and darkened the river Sammy, Chloe, and Ceil followed."
0,"When the ground became almost too dark to see, Ceil deviated from the river to a small grassy field."
0,"A thin trodden path led through the knee-high grass, and soon the grass changed to purple, feather-like flowers that were beginning to curl up and close their pedals for the night."
0,The forest at the end of the field was unlike the earlier forest they had traveled.
0,"It appeared well kept, almost as if the location of every plant was meticulously chosen, and there were no dead leaves or stray twigs."
0,It reminded Sammy of a well-kept garden rather than a forest.
0,"Finally, a small hut that looked as if it had grown from the forest floor came into view."
0,“This is where you live?” Sammy asked.
0,Sammy and Chloe looked around them and admired the fantasy-like garden home.
0,Ceil paid them no attention.
0,Her eyes scanned the area with worry.
0,"When she found what she searched for, she frowned."
0,“Do you think I am the kind of person who would let you keep some stray animal you brought home with you?”
0,"Sammy looked around to find the origin of the smooth tenor voice, but there was no one."
0,"“I have my reasons,” Ceil replied."
0,“Reasons?
0,"We gave you stewardship of our forest because we cannot be bothered with menial tasks, but the forest is still ours, is it not?” "
0,Ceil’s eyes followed the bodyless voice as it circled Sammy and Chloe and stopped on Justin’s stomach.
0,She remained silent.
0,"“We felt the presence of intruders and sent you to take care of them, and this is not the care we intended."
0,I do not assume you misinterpreted our orders.”
0,"Ceil’s countenance fell, and her shoulders slouched."
0,"“And humans, no less."
0,Are humans not your enemy?
0,Do you not hate them?
0,Did they not kill Eydis and destroy your home?”
0,"“Eydis is still alive!” Sammy shouted at the unknown, invisible voice and immediately felt an immense pressure weighing down on her."
0,"Both she and Chloe collapsed to the ground, dumping Justin off the stretcher behind them."
0,Tears fell from Sammy’s eyes from being overpowered by a single pure emotion: dread.
0,"Some unknown force clouded her mind, constricted her body, and bound her tongue."
0,"“I did not give you permission to speak,” the voice rebuked."
0,“Stop!
0,They are different!
0,They are friends of Eydis!” Ceil pleaded.
0,“Oh?”
0,"The pressure slacked a little, but Sammy was still unable to move or speak, and the slight relaxation of her core caused her to vomit what little was in her stomach."
0,"Seeing this, Ceil pleaded stronger."
0,“It is true!
0,"They were with Eydis fighting against Jethro before they were separated,” Ceil explained."
0,“And what if that story was fabricated?
0,"The humans have subdued our neighbors, the dryads to the east and Mountain Elves to the south but have yet to get a foothold in our forest."
0,Could this not be an attempt by them to infiltrate and capture you?”
0,Ceil gritted her teeth and fell silent.
0,"She had no solid evidence that what the invisible voice said was false, and Sammy could not speak in defense of herself, Chloe, or Justin."
0,"“However, I do trust your judgement."
0,We would not have made you steward of our forest if we did not.”
0,A small glint of hope rose on Ceil’s face.
0,“But we cannot have you ignoring our orders either.
0,We too need to be cautious and make certain that you have not been manipulated by the humans.
0,"With the dryads under human control and so close by, you could have been made to believe these humans by a kissiae draught.”"
0,"“I am not--” Ceil’s voice cut off for an unknown reason, and Sammy was unable to look up to see why."
0,“I will have you prove to us you are not under their influence.
0,You will kill the loud one.
0,She is not important in what is to come.”
0,Kill me?
0,"Sammy’s heart sank, and the chill of death sent shivers down her spine."
0,"She could not look up to see Ceil’s reaction, and Ceil’s silence worried her even more."
0,Was she considering it?
0,"In Sammy’s position, she could not resist any attempt on her life."
0,"Please, no…"
0,“Does it have to be Sammy?” 
0,"Relief washed over Sammy, but then the weight of Ceil’s question struck her."
0,“Can I kill the man?
0,He will not survive anyway.”
0,No! Not Justin!
0,“Mercy killing?
0,What would that prove?”
0,“Then…” 
0,Not Chloe either!
0,"Please, if you need to kill someone, kill me… please…"
0,"“Attack that girl, and you will not remain unscathed."
0,"You cannot treat severe burns with your skill in healing,” the voice said."
0,Sammy’s eyes shifted over to the ground where Chloe hunched over.
0,"The groundcover wilted, and embers grew where Chloe’s arms touched the soil."
0,“The loud one is your only option.”
0,Again there was silence.
0,The voice did not speak or push Ceil into a decision.
0,"Sammy could only wait, and the silence continued for what felt like an eternity."
0,In Sammy’s heart she prayed for mercy but if a life needed to be taken then it would be hers.
0,"“I refuse,” Ceil answered."
0,“Even if that means exile?
0,We cannot have one who sides with the enemy continue to live in our forest.”
0,“I am not of your forest.
0,You let me stay here until I could collect my thoughts and emotions.
0,I am fine now.
0,I will not kill Sammy.”
0,The weight bearing down on Sammy lifted.
0,"Her heart, body, and mind ached, and in the relief that flooded her, she broke into sobbing."
0,"Ceil knelt in front of her, and Sammy lunged at Ceil."
0,"She wrapped her arms around Ceil’s neck, and they both fell back onto the ground."
0,"There Sammy cried into Ceil’s shoulder, thanking her over and over again."
0,“She truly is a loud one.” 
0,The invisible voice no longer held an antagonistic tone and was now more playful.
0,"“If you were willing to kill this human, then we would know you have not yet recovered and would need more time to be prepared for your role.”"
0,Ceil’s hand stopped rubbing Sammy’s back.
0,“This was not to prove my loyalty to the sprites?”
0,“Not at all.
0,It was a test of your mental health.
0,"But, we are still going to exile you.”"
0,Ceil sighed as if this result was expected.
0,Sammy’s hands balled into fists.
0,She lifted herself off Ceil and looked in the direction she heard the voice.
0,“You staked our lives on some test?!”
0,"“No, just your life.” "
0,The voice no longer sounded as if it was next to Sammy.
0,It played in her mind like a foreign thought.
0,"This surprised her, and by a hunch, she replied through thought."
0,Does my life mean nothing to you?
0,“Both the Master of Time and the Aspect of Destruction have important roles to play.
0,You on the other hand are unimportant.
0,"If Ceil decided to kill you, it would have been no major loss.”"
0,Sammy spat out some of the vomit lingering in her mouth and swiped her arm at the air in front of her.
0,"“Show yourself, coward!”"
0,"“Sammy, you cannot talk to the Sprite Arkhon that way!” "
0,Ceil covered Sammy’s mouth.
0,“Please forgive her.
0,She has been through a lot.”
0,"“Oh, it is no problem at all."
0,"If anything, I should commend her courage, or foolishness, in lashing out at me after feeling my power firsthand."
0,Even you swatted at me when we first met.”
0,"“I did not know who you were, and I was in a much darker place then…” "
0,“No matter.
0,"You are all tired from travels, so we will prepare a sendoff feast.”"
0,“So you really are going to exile her?” 
0,"For the first time, Chloe spoke up from behind them."
0,"When Sammy looked over her shoulder, she saw that Chloe had been preoccupied patting out the embers she unintentionally created."
0,"“Ceil will accomplish nothing by staying here,” the Arkhon said."
0,Sammy peeled away Ceil’s hand.
0,“We do not need a feast.
0,"Please, help Justin.”"
0,“I already told you that the Master of Time has a role to play.
0,We will not let him die under our watch.
0,Relax.
0,He will be fine for an evening.”
0,You keep talking about roles.
0,Roles in what?
0,"“After all you have been through, can you still say you do not know?”"
0,Something to do with Jethro invading and searching for Eydis?
0,“Wash up.
0,"We will take care of preparations in the meantime,” the Arkhon said."
0,"“Answer me, damn it!”"
0,Ceil quickly covered Sammy’s mouth again.
0,“I am sure they will watch over Justin.
0,"The sprites are strict, but they are a kind race."
0,They will not leave him unattended.”
1,"Sammy groaned through her nose and let Ceil lead her and Chloe behind the hut to a small, ground-fed spring of crystal clear water."
0,The area was illuminated by orange and yellow phosphorescent flowers.
0,"Ceil shed her fur skirt and stepped in, lifting her two tails to her waist before sitting down in the water."
0,Chloe stripped and followed Ceil.
0,“Is this the same ice water as the river?” Sammy asked.
0,"“You learned how to handle it, did you not?” Ceil asked back."
0,“I don’t think I could do it with this much water.”
0,“I’ll heat it for you.” 
0,Chloe beckoned for Sammy to enter.
0,"The water around Chloe began to bubble, and Ceil moved quickly to the other side of the spring."
0,"“If it gets too hot, tell me."
0,I can’t really tell if most things are hot anymore.”
0,"Sammy removed her shirt, pants, and underwear and set them beside the spring."
0,"She mentally braced herself before stepping into the spring but found it slightly warm, not unlike an indoor pool."
0,"When she sat down, the water was deep enough to reach her neck, a perfect depth."
0,"Compared to what she had been through the past few days, this spring was heavenly bliss, and she felt as if she could fall asleep sitting there in the water."
0,"“You do not hide your emotions well,” Ceil remarked, but Sammy was too relaxed to become embarrassed at whatever face she was making."
0,Ceil reached her hand over to the moss-like plants growing on the edge of the spring.
0,"The moss grew rapidly, and she tore off a few pieces about the size of her fist."
0,She tossed one to Sammy and one to Chloe.
0,“Wash with this.
0,"It will remove the dirt, and the oil it releases when crushed is good for your skin.”"
0,A soft aroma entered Sammy’s nose.
0,She smelled the torn moss and found that it gave off a sweet but herbal scent.
0,The closest comparison she could make was a mix between dry basil and rose.
0,"“The smell is pleasant, too,” Ceil added."
0,"“There are so many convenient plants here, this moss, a root that heals you, and that bubbly grass,” Chloe said in mild amazement."
0,"“There are useful plants everywhere if you know how to use them,” Ceil said."
0,“I am sure that is true wherever you are from.
0,"If you are not from Tolmyur, are you from the Wilderlands?"
0,I could not imagine living there.”
0,Sammy wanted to correct Ceil but could not figure out how to explain that she and Chloe were from another world.
0,Chloe glanced at Sammy with a crooked smile showing that she too could not think of a good way to bring it up.
1,"When they left the spring, the once pristine water was murky which made Sammy feel a little guilty for soiling it."
0,Sammy’s clothes had been cleaned and folded without her knowledge in the short time they bathed.
0,"Ceil’s fur skirt was replaced by a slimmer, tan, almost silken skirt."
0,It tied on the side and had a white sash that wrapped around the waist to cover the top pleats and seam.
0,"It looked elegant, in stark contrast to the crude fur she had worn before."
0,"Chloe was provided a similar white sash, but it was wider and longer than Ceil’s."
0,“What do I do with this?” Chloe asked.
0,Ceil looked at Chloe perplexed.
0,“Your breasts are that large and you have never used one before?”
0,“Ah!” Chloe held the sash and tried to figure out how to tie it.
0,Ceil’s exasperated stare forced Sammy to explain.
0,She held up her bra.
0,“We use these to support our breasts.
0,I have never used a bind.”
0,"“I haven’t either,” Chloe admitted."
0,Ceil shook her head and walked over to help Chloe.
0,The way she wrapped the bind was not to compress Chloe’s breasts but support them with her back and a little help from her shoulders like a bra.
0,She finished the wrap by pleating the cloth to make it thinner and tied it into an intricate bow on her upper back.
0,"The way the white fabric hung from between her shoulder blades looked like small angel wings, and Sammy secretly wished that she could wear one too."
1,"On the other side of the hut, an impossible amount of preparation had happened in the manner of a short bath’s time."
0,"A five-foot diameter tree had appeared from nowhere, been cut lengthwise in half to create a long table, and the other half was sectioned and carved lengthwise into a bench."
0,The area was lit by flaming torches that resembled tiki torches but were clearly grown to match the appearance and not crafted.
0,On the table sat countless unknown fruits and plants with cooked meat of various sorts sliced and arranged evenly along the middle.
0,There was enough food for twenty to thirty people to eat their fill.
0,Ceil looked at the arrangement more exhausted than surprised.
0,“They went overboard again.”
0,"“They’ve done this before?” Chloe asked, excited."
0,She could eat her fill without worry.
0,“Every day for a while after I came here and just as much food.
0,They do not get many visitors here.
0,Those territorial birds tend to keep everyone out.”
0,"Without warning, a gust of wind swept the three of them off the ground and set them gently down on the bench."
0,Food floated from random locations on the table and piled up on flat stones set in front of them like plates.
0,Sammy’s eyes darted around trying to see the invisible hands moving the food.
0,"“I was wondering after what you said to the Sprite Arkhon, but can you really not see them,” Ceil asked."
0,"“I can a little,” Chloe replied while sampling a small, yellow, crescent shaped berry."
0,“Seriously?!”
0, Sammy could not believe that she was the only one.
0,"“Yah, but it’s faint."
0,"I can only see something like an outline,” Chloe elaborated."
0,"“If I blink, I lose them.”"
0,"Why can Chloe see them and I can’t, Sammy wondered in silence."
0,"“Oh, it is because we are beings made of ven!”"
0,A high-pitched feminine voice spoke from right beside Sammy’s ear making her jolt her head to the side.
0,“Those who are not skilled at sensing ven cannot see us.”
0,“This just means you are unskilled.” 
0,The last comment was the same tenor voice of the Sprite Arkhon.
0,Sammy reflexively reached out to where she heard the voice to try and grab it.
0,"She felt nothing but warm air through her fingers, which made her feel a little frustrated."
0,“How many of them are here?”
0,Chloe scanned the table and area around them.
0,“A lot?”
0,“Fifty-seven of us to be exact.”
0,“There are a few others.”
0,“But they have business elsewhere.”
0,"Each reply came from a different voice, both male and female."
0,“How many sprites live in this forest?” Chloe asked.
0,“Aside from the fifty-seven of us?”
0,“Only eleven more.” 
0,The number surprised Sammy.
0,“That few?”
0,"“There are 326 sprites on Whinhlem, which is a lot, considering.” "
0,"“And that includes all the wind, earth, water, and fire sprites.” "
0,“Enough talk.
0,Eat up!”
0,A sprig of some red plant was shoved in Sammy’s mouth the moment she opened it to ask another question.
0,"Giving up, she decided to eat, but her eyes continued glancing around to find Justin."
0,"She had no choice but to trust that what the Arkhon said was true, that they would take care of him."
1,"* * *
That night, Sammy had a restless sleep."
0,"The bedding of thick moss covered with furs was comfortable, and the smell of the furs was not too unpleasant, but her mind could not stop thinking of Justin who she had not seen all night."
0,"The past few nights she slept huddled up next to him, and now her arms felt empty."
0,Worry for his health and safety plagued her mind.
0,She gently peeled off her fur covering to not disturb Chloe beside her.
0,Ceil was curled up to the side holding the tips of her two tails up between her legs and close to her chest as if they were a security blanket.
0,In the dark she looked more like a scared girl than the authoritative woman who had led them down a thousand-foot cliff and through the valley.
0,The only light in the garden forest came from the few phosphorescent plants scattered around the forest floor.
0,"Most of the light glowed from the spring behind the hut, but it was not enough for Sammy to see well where she walked."
0,The evidence of the banquet that still filled her stomach to bursting had vanished as if it had never existed.
0,There was not even an imprint of the large tree trunk that was used as a table.
0,Sammy did not have a destination in mind.
0,"She knew that she should not stray far from the hut, but at the same time, she had not seen Justin anywhere near the hut."
0,"If she could see him, then maybe she could get some sleep, but after searching in the cold night for an unknown amount of time, there was no trace of him anywhere."
1,She sat down amid the purple feather-like flowers that had fully closed for the night and held her shivering arms.
0,"“Arkhon, are you there?”"
0,"After a brief silence, Sammy felt a light warm breeze caress her cheek, and the air around her slowly warmed to a comfortable temperature."
0,“How could you tell?” he asked.
0,“Just a hunch.”
0,“Do you need something?” 
0,Sammy had called out to him without a reason.
0,She did not know what to say or ask even though she was sure she had many questions and a few things to vent.
0,She scratched the itch of the mark on her neck as she ordered her thoughts.
0,"In the end, her mind still lingered most on Justin."
0,“Where are you keeping Justin?”
0,“This way.” 
1,"Sammy was unable to see the Arkhon, so a gentle breeze pushed at her back to direct her."
0,It led her behind the hut past the spring into a small grove.
0,Justin lay on a bed of moss covered in tiny white flowers.
0,The scene illuminated in faint orange light of the spring gripped at her heart.
0,The only word that came to mind to describe it was a funeral.
0,She quickly grabbed Justin’s hand.
0,It was still warm.
0,"“Do not worry, Sammy."
0,I gave my word that he would be well.
0,We washed and fed him as well as took care of his waste.
0,He is no worse than when you brought him here.”
0,“And no better?
0,Can you not treat him?
0,Isn’t he important to some role he has to play in this war?”
0,"“War? An apt description, but the true war has yet to begin."
0,"As for his role, yes he can contribute much, but even if he dies here, the war will still happen and reach its conclusion without him."
0,"His involvement will be a benefit, but it is in no way necessary."
0,Same for Chloe.”
0,“And me?” 
0,“Your involvement will mean nothing.
0,"Whether you live or die, you will make no difference in what is to come.”"
0,Sammy could not stand how casually he stated that her life was meaningless.
0,The anger of his test with her life at stake resurfaced.
0,Sammy’s shoulders shook.
0,She gritted her teeth to refrain from shouting at the Arkhon.
0,Chloe and Ceil were sleeping peacefully in the hut not too far away.
0,“There is nothing to be angry about.
0,Think of how many tens of billions of sentient lives are on this planet and how many more there are in the universe.
0,Not every one of them can be significant.
0,"It just so happens that a few of those close to you are, which is astounding for you, if you think about it."
0,There is nothing to be ashamed of in you being normal.”
0,The Sprite Arkhon’s attempts at calming or assuring Sammy only fueled her anger.
0,“I’ll prove you wrong.”
0,“Oh?” 
0,“I’ll prove you wrong.
0,I can’t just accept that you think I’m so worthless that I can be freely killed in some test to see if Ceil can accept humans.
0,My life is worth more than that!” 
0,"Realizing she just shouted, Sammy looked back towards the hut hoping that she had not disturbed Chloe and Ceil’s sleep."
0,"The forest remained silent, and no one in the hut stirred, so Sammy took a deep breath to calm down."
0,"“Sure, I don’t have a rare affinity like Justin or have strong magic potential like Chloe."
0,I don’t know anything about Whinhlem or the war or what’s going on.
0,That doesn’t matter.
0,"If Justin and Chloe are going to get pulled into all this, I’ll prove that my existence is significant too.”"
0,“Is that so?
0,What will you do?”
0,"Sammy looked down at Justin, and her hand grasped his."
0,"“First, I’ll make sure Justin recovers."
0,I don’t want him to be involved in a war.
0,He is too kind-hearted for that.
0,"But if it is going to happen and he will be a great help, I’ll make sure he can."
0,Same with Chloe.”
0,“You will support them?
0,There are many who can and will take that role.”
0,“That’s only a start.
0,"I don’t know enough about what’s going on, but I’ll learn."
0,I’ll make sure I am irreplaceable.”
0,The Arkhon chuckled.
0,“Interesting.
0,How about this?
0,"If you make a meaningful contribution, I will reward you."
0,"You have given your word, so make certain that Justin recovers and then prove that you have a role."
0,We will be watching.”
0,"The chill of the night air returned, so Sammy knew the Sprite Arkhon left, but the anger and unease of their conversation remained."
0,What am I going to do?
0,"She made a bet with a being far more powerful than her, but when thinking it over, there were no consequences if she failed in fulfilling her side of the bet."
0,It would only mean that he was right.
0,Sammy looked down at Justin.
0,"She did not want to leave him alone in the forest, so she returned to the hut and grabbed a spare fur."
0,She nestled down in the grove next to him and wrapped them in the fur to ward off the cold.
0,"Justin was still quite warm, hinting that his fever lingered."
0,“You will get better.
0,I promise.”
0,Sammy calmed down with Justin in her arms and fell asleep in the mellow orange light of the forest.
1,"* * *
The next morning, Sammy was awoken by the tap of Ceil’s staff."
0,"Ceil’s face looked mildly displeased, but she said nothing."
0,Sammy checked on Justin to find that nothing had changed and left him in the grove to follow Ceil back to the hut.
0,“We leave as soon as we are ready.” Ceil sat down three sacks of provisions provided by the sprites.
0,Chloe picked hers up and looked inside.
0,It contained many of the same foods from the banquet but in dried and otherwise preserved form.
0,“Where are we headed?”
0,“Somewhere we can heal Justin.” 
0,"Sammy looked at Ceil, and Ceil nodded."
0,"“If you want to save him, then the dryads in Dhuillir are your best option."
0,"It is about twenty to thirty days away depending on weather and other conditions, but carrying that man, maybe double."
0,"The Mountain Elves to the south are closer, but you are liable to be attacked because you are human, and there will be little help for you there."
0,"They surrendered to Tolmyur, but that does not mean they do not hold a grudge."
0,They are a race not to be angered.
0,"While carrying the stretcher, we won’t be able to cross the plateaus to the north to enter western Vallen to seek help from the fairies either."
0,They lack the same veins running through them that we used to descend.
0,"As you heard from the Sprite Arkhon, the dryads are under the control of Tolmyur."
0,"You should be able to get them to help because you are humans, but my presence poses a problem."
0,The humans are looking for me.”
0,“Are you not coming with us?” Chloe pleaded to Ceil.
0,“I am.
0,You will not make it on your own.
0,You have proven that you know nothing of survival.
0,We will have to be careful.”
1,"After a meal that would not cause discomfort while traveling, Chloe and Sammy retrieved Justin and set him on the stretcher now lined with fur."
0,Ceil looked longingly at the hut and forest garden.
0,"“Will you miss us?” the Arkhon asked out of nowhere, even surprising Ceil."
0,"“Not your habit of suddenly appearing, that is for certain."
0,"But, I will miss this place.”"
0,“Even though it is not the Amelian Palace?” 
0,Ceil frowned.
0,“You know I hated the palace.
0,I prefer nature.”
0,“Of course!
0,"If you did not, you would not have planted all those purple flowers, or replaced the tub with an outdoor spring, or transplanted the shrubs, or meticulously cleared any debris on the forest floor, or asked us to rearrange the trees, or improved on the house, or…”"
0,“I know! I know! Stop!”
0,Ceil’s cheeks flushed pink.
0,"Sammy thought that the garden was something that the sprites created, but knowing that the breathtaking beauty was Ceil’s doing made Sammy chuckle."
0,"“Before I leave, I want to thank you for taking care of me."
0,I will not try to kill myself anymore.
0,I promise.”
0,“Kill yourself?” 
0,"Sammy rushed to Ceil’s side, but Ceil waved her off."
0,“It is nothing.”
0,“And the humans?” the Arkhon asked.
0,"“I cannot forgive them, but,” Ceil looked over at Sammy and smiled."
0,"“I suppose there are good ones out there, especially if Eydis accepted them, so I will try to be open-minded.”"
0,“Then you are good to go.
0,"As of now, you are officially exiled from Fiorrae,” the Arkhon announced."
0,Ceil began walking.
0,Sammy hurried back to Chloe to help carry Justin.
0,"When the hut was almost out of sight, Sammy heard a whisper in her mind."
0,“I will be watching.”
0,"Interlude
“Seething”
Eydis"
1,"Sean approached the desk with a small stack of papers, and Eydis acted like she did not notice, instead choosing to write in the personal memory journal her psychologist ordered her to keep."
0,"“No need to ignore me,” Sean said."
0,“There is nothing you need to fill out or sign this time.”
0,"Eydis finished the passage she was working on, a memory of her first official day in the Grand Amelian Council where she signed into law an ease of the ocean border restrictions around the Tolmyur Kingdom to allow the merfolk and sirens to fish in the more bounteous shoreline that was unaffected by a sudden warm current that had killed most the fish in deeper waters."
0,"Only once she finished did she finally look Sean in the eyes, but her expression was sour, both because the stacks of paper Sean brought were always trouble for her and because that memory was not a pleasant one."
0,She felt pity for the pleading sirens and merfolk and argued against the council who were almost unanimously opposed to the proposal until she bent them too her will.
0,"Her father praised her at the time, but the decision ended in disaster for all parties involved, although she still could not quite remember what happened, adding to her irritation."
0,Sean first handed a single letter already opened even though it was addressed to her.
0,“This is from the NRA.”
0,“NRA?
0,"That was one of your country’s arms organizations, yes?” "
0,She removed the letter from the envelope and scanned it over.
0,“Is this about the war?”
0,“Sort of.
0,"They claim that because of you, the sale of personal firearms has skyrocketed."
0,They wanted to express their support and are asking if you were willing to cooperate with them on--”
0,Eydis held up her hand to silence Sean and tossed the letter to the side of her desk.
0,“I understand.
0,They want to use me to increase their political influence.
0,I will think about it.”
0,"Next, Sean handed Eydis a thin stack of papers."
0,Eydis recognized them immediately and tossed them to the side again.
0,“More protests?
0,Where this time?”
0,“This one is worse than the others.
0,"There was an organized march in Portland, Oregon, that broke out into violence when extremists got involved."
0,Some people thought they were being attacked and shot rioting protesters.
0,"No deaths, but fifteen were hospitalized, and there was nearly a million dollars’ worth of damage from vandalism alone."
0,The city is claiming that--”
0,Eydis waved her hand again.
0,This was why she hated whenever Sean came in with stacks of paper.
0,"She was used to helping her father sit in the Grand Council for debates, but everything that was brought to her here was of little consequence."
0,It could be handled by local authorities and had no effect on the nation as a whole.
0,She was preparing the nation for war but was continually being bothered by so many trivialities that she couldn’t help but grow frustrated.
0,Sean was likewise growing frustrated at Eydis’s seeming lack of concern.
0,“This is the last one.
0,We have another lawsuit; this time from some entrepreneur who claims your scare tactics caused his new business to fail by running everyone out of Gullivan.”
0,"Sean sat the final stack of papers on the desk in front of Eydis, but she slid them to the side without even glancing at them."
0,“Have it dismissed like the others.
0,That is what war is.
0,This country has been at peace in their lands for so long that they do not know how to cope with an attack on their own soil.
0,That entrepreneur is only using me as an outlet for his anger at himself for lacking the skill to recover on his own.”
0,Sean paced while rubbing his forehead with his thumb and forefinger.
0,“You do realize that much of this could have been prevented if you kept to the script.”
0,Eydis looked up at Sean with a sharp glare.
0,“I am not going to hide who I am and lie to a country that was just attacked by a mutual enemy.”
1,"* * *
One week ago."
0,"After the outcry from the public reached a breaking point, the United States government gave permission to hold a press conference with Colonel Richards and Eydis as the key speakers."
0,"Eydis had already sat in conference with the President of the United States and other federal and military leaders to explain the truth of what happened, her origin, and where this new enemy capable of magic came from."
0,"Eydis hid nothing, and most of the faces in the room were ashen by the end."
0,"Sean and Miriam’s testimony added validity to Eydis’s claims, and Symra’s recount of the events in Whinhlem after Eydis’s disappearance up until the experiments that sent Symra to Earth removed all doubt no matter how impossible to believe the accounts may have been to those who listened."
0,The consensus of the meeting was that the truth should be kept secret to prevent mass panic and political and international unrest.
0,"The script Eydis needed to follow for the press conference was written by someone from the government, and the number of half-truths and straight fabrications leaking from the text made Eydis ill. "
0,"She could not in fair conscience spew such filth to the people who lost their loved ones to Jethro’s attack, especially when she too lost people she loved."
0,She was certain Justin would never forgive her if he was still alive.
0,"She could not remember well, but she was sure that even though Justin worked hard to keep Eydis’s origins a secret, he also was not against revealing those secrets when it was needed."
0,How else would Miriam and Sean know everything if Justin felt no need to reveal it?
1,“All you need to do is follow the script.
0,We will take care of everything else.”
0,Colonel Richards handed Eydis a black beret to complete her Army Service Uniform.
0,"She was not enlisted, but for official appearances, he requested she wear military attire with insignia designating her as a civilian service member, to which she was not opposed."
0,Her hair was pulled back and wound into a low bun in such a way that her hair covered and pressed her ears against her head to hide the long tips.
0,"According to the script, her Elven origin was also to be kept secret."
0,They even provided mildly irritating contact lenses to make her eyes appear human.
0,"“We would prefer you not take part in the conference,” Colonel Richards admitted, “but because your doppelganger appeared on the news in conflict with the police during one of the preliminary attacks and word leaked that you are directly connected, the press is pushing hard for your attendance."
0,"If you do not show, the briefing might only fan the flames.”"
0,Eydis was constantly amazed at the speed news and gossip spread in this world.
0,"Not only did they recognize and identify Eydis from the brief appearance of the Lurr doppelganger, they were able to make connections between that event and the person aiding the Army in cleaning up the aftermath of the invasion."
0,"She placed on the beret, and Colonel Richards adjusted it."
0,“I am fine with speaking.
0,"You need not worry about me,” Eydis said flatly."
0,The concern did not leave Colonel Richard’s face.
0,“Your ability to speak is not what I am worried about.”
1,Colonel Richards led Eydis down the hall and through a sliding door into the small room where the press conference was held.
0,Shutters clapped incessantly as the press immediately began taking photos of Eydis and the Colonel before the conference even began.
0,Those in the seats readied their notebooks and memo pads both to take notes and to have their pre-arranged questions on hand.
0,"Eydis and Colonel Richards stood to the side while another woman, the Press Secretary, took the podium."
0,"Eydis would have thought that the President of this country would be the one to address his people, but Colonel Richards explained beforehand that the President had already given his address on the tragedy."
0,Because so little information was given--the purpose of the address was only to show his remorse and promise to investigate and strike back at those who attacked--the press had been demanding more information.
0,Only a brief welcome to the press by the Press Secretary preceded a recounting of the details of Jethro’s invasion.
0,"Unlike the President’s address, the estimated number and nature of the invaders was given as well as locations of the attacks in Gullivan and the number of dead at each location."
0,About 1000 soldiers invaded and over 5000 citizens died in total; a little less than one-fifth were students attending the university.
0,"Again, the Press Secretary expressed the sorrow and remorse of the President and other federal leaders."
0,"While nothing she said was false, her address contained no information that would ready the people for the war they were now involved in."
0,Eydis frowned within herself.
0,This information helped no one.
1,"Once her address was finished, the Press Secretary introduced Colonel Richards to give an explanation of his involvement and the operations of the Army during the invasion as well as their current efforts to aid in the aftermath."
0,He began with the initial abduction of Eydis from the university and the attack on the hospital when the police did not realize the attacker they captured was still armed.
0,"This surprised Eydis, because this information was not included in what was permissible for her to speak about."
0,They strictly forbade her from talking about her abduction and fight with Jethro’s assassins.
0,Was it to prevent her from mentioning magic?
0,Or maybe to keep her abilities secret?
0,"She doubted that any single person in this country’s military would be able to fight off so many men unarmed, especially when magic and Lurr were involved."
0,"Colonel Richards continued by recounting the police’s request for aid and then addressed the attack by the minum but left out the doppelganger’s involvement, explaining that they framed a child as the threat and that Eydis intervened to help them realize who the real threat was, but regrettably, the attacker escaped."
0,The invasion followed.
0,"Eydis knew that the internal workings of the military in any country were something held secret, so she was not surprised by the level of dilution in Colonel Richard’s recount."
0,He only detailed where his soldiers were and how they were able to coordinate with nearby cities to expedite evacuation and protection of the citizens.
0,He ended with an apology for lack of information on the size of the enemy forces that led to the lack of manpower in the city at the time of the invasion.
0,"Unlike the address up until now, the information on the cleanup and recovery work was highly detailed."
1,"When Colonel Richards finished, the press began raising their hands to ask questions, but he introduced Eydis, stating that questions will be held until after she spoke."
0,"According to the script, all Eydis had to do was explain that she was royalty, that she had escaped these attackers after a coup that caused the death of her family, that she sought asylum in this country but did not realize that her attackers would follow in force."
0,They even went through the trouble of selecting cities that were involved in recent conflicts to give her a location of origin.
0,"She would then give her side of the story about her involvement in the invasion, how she was injured and was recovering at the hospital during the time of the attack."
0,Their script neglected the war that was likely raging in her world and that now leaked into theirs.
0,It did not explain how the attackers got into the country let alone the city.
0,"Worst and most important of all, it did not explain that this war was not over for them, and there was a very real threat that Jethro would return with a larger, more powerful force."
0,"Everything in her speech was to ease the worries of the citizens, but creating false security would only do more harm."
0,Nothing in it prepared them for war.
0,Nothing informed them of the true strength of those who declared war against them.
0,Nothing informed them that the enemy had the power to appear within their borders at any time and recreate the same disaster that befell Gullivan any number of times over.
0,Eydis walked up to the podium amid the countless shuttering of cameras.
0,The press viewed her with hungry eyes waiting to hear from the one they saw as not only the center of this disaster but potentially the cause.
0,"“If those here try to remove me, it is because there is much they do not wish the people of this country to know."
0,"From what I have learned of your government, I trust it is not one which would resort to killing the press in order to silence the spread of information, but I will give you the choice."
0,"Leave here and remain safe in your ignorance, or stay and learn a bit of the truth about the conflict you have found your nation involved in.”"
0,"Colonel Richards hurried to the podium to try and pull Eydis away, but he was blocked by a barrier."
0,He did not hit on the barrier or acknowledge it because doing so would inform the press of the existence of something invisible.
0,"Like any who hunger for information, the press remained rooted in place and would not be moved."
0,This made Eydis smile.
0,“I am glad to see your conviction.”
0,Eydis removed her beret and unwound her bun.
0,Her fine yet full hair fell down her back without so much as a kink or curl from the tight bun it was wound in.
0,Her long pointed ears popped out beside her head for all the press to see.
0,She then brought her fingers to her eyes and removed the contacts to show her oval pupils.
0,The former clattering of cameras could not even compare to the noise that erupted.
0,"The press looked on in both amazement and confusion, some possibly wondering if this was a stunt or some joke."
0,Colonel Richards gave the order to cut the live stream.
0,"Security tried to coax the press to leave, but they would not budge."
0,"“My name is Eydis FeAmel, First Princess of the Amelian Empire."
0,"As you can see, I am not human."
0,I am an elf.
0,"What you must know is that your nation is now at war, and I am the one who brought this war to you.”"
0,The press stood and shouted questions in quick succession.
0,"Eydis made a mental note of all she heard and promised to answer what she could to quiet the press, but first, she needed to explain what she meant."
0,"“Where I come from, the humans and elves are at war."
0,My family was assassinated by a man named Jethro who is commander of the human forces.
0,"By some stroke of fate, I found myself in your country, but by doing so, you became involved in our war."
0,"For that, I sincerely apologize, but I had no control over the events that occurred."
0,"I did not come here by choice, and there is no way for me to return."
0,What I can do and am doing is aid your military in preparation for future attacks that will most likely happen.
0,"You have strong power in your technology, the likes of which I have never seen, but the enemy is just as powerful in ways you could only imagine."
0,Within that power is the ability for them to strike anywhere they please and invade any city no matter how deep within your borders it resides.
0,This power is something I too thought was impossible.
0,"It is how one thousand soldiers appeared without warning inside your borders and assaulted Gullivan, and there is a high possibility that they will appear there again in far greater numbers."
0,"Had I known they had this ability, I would have raised alarm sooner so that you would have been prepared.”"
0,"With that explanation, six of the questions Eydis heard were answered, but there were still many more, including how elves could exist and where they had been hiding all this time, the rumors of demons appearing in the city before the attack, and how eyewitnesses of the invasion said that the invading soldiers were using witchcraft or magic."
0,"Most of these questions involved information that Eydis still felt the people of this world were not ready for, yet."
0,How would they react with the knowledge that Jethro had invaded from another world?
0,What would happen if the existence of magic was common knowledge and not something only found in this world’s fiction or fantasy or legends?
0,The reason that she revealed herself as an elf was to separate herself from those of this country and to become the scapegoat for any blame that might have befallen the government and military due to their shortcomings in handling this or future conflicts.
0,"If the people could blame her instead of acting out against the government, the government could better prepare for war."
0,"This would appease the government’s worries of political unrest, or so she hoped."
0,Most important was that the citizens now knew of the war.
0,"Avoiding questions and answers involving magic or her world, Eydis answered every other question the press presented her with the truth that their government wanted to hide."
1,"* * *
Sean sighed."
0,"“I understand why you did it, but…” His voice trailed off."
0,Arguing with Eydis would accomplish nothing.
0,“If only he had contacted the authorities sooner.” 
0,"Sean’s voice was no more than a whisper as he was exiting the room, but Eydis’s elven ears heard it clear."
0,“You cannot blame Justin for this!
0,He was a victim like everyone else!”
0,"Eydis’s chair fell back to the ground, and a burst of wind sent the contents atop her desk flying."
0,Sean was not startled by the outburst.
0,It was only one of far too many.
0,He shook his head.
0,“I am not blaming him.
0,This is all our problem.
0,"Me, you, and Miriam included.”"
0,“There is no point dwelling on the past.” 
0,Miriam walked through the door and tapped Sean on the side of the head with her clipboard.
0,She then waved it at Eydis.
0,“I finally got permission.
0,We can talk with the old woman and giant.”
0,“How?
0,I thought they were worried that Eydis would go berserk the moment she saw them.”
0,Even mentioning the two officers of Jethro’s army that were captured caused Eydis’s heart to race and her stomach to churn.
0,"Already fuming from Sean’s comment about Justin, she fought to contain her boiling anger and hatred."
0,"They were not the ones who killed Justin, but they represented the one who did."
0,"“It wasn’t easy, but to explain simply, Symra and I will be there to protect them from Eydis and vice versa."
0,Symra hasn’t been able to get any information out of them.
0,Interrogations have been difficult with the government preventing Symra from using any form of torture.
0,We might be able to get them to talk if their target is in front of them.”
0,“Are you really okay with putting yourself in danger like that?” Sean asked.
0,Miriam smiled.
0,"“Although Symra won’t admit it, I am better at reinforcement magic than she is."
0,"If anything, she’ll get hurt before I do, but thanks for the concern.” "
0,She then looked sternly at Eydis.
0,“It all comes down to whether or not Eydis can keep her emotions in check.
0,Can you?”
0,Eydis took a few breaths to calm down and nodded.
0,Sean grabbed the clipboard and scanned the permission papers.
0,"“Are they still in ADX, or did they decide to move them to Carswell?”"
0,“Eydis hasn’t told you?
0,"The plan was to keep the giant in ADX and move the woman to Carswell because she is not handling our world well, but the giant refuses to be separated from her."
0,"According to Symra, he could break out at any time if he wanted, and the only reason he hasn’t is because of her."
0,"So long as she is with him, he will not rampage."
0,"But, the woman needs medical attention, so in the end they made special arrangements to bring the giant to Carswell with her.”"
0,“When do we go?” 
0,“As soon as we are ready.
0,We only need to tell them when.”
0,“We go now.” 
0,Eydis grabbed the clip board and opened a portal.
0,Miriam quickly closed the door before anyone outside could see.
0,“They specifically asked us not to teleport.”
0,“That is because it makes me hard to track.” 
0,Sean grabbed the clipboard back.
0,"“No, it’s because if we start appearing in locations that are impossible to reach in such a short amount of time, people will start asking questions."
0,Only a handful of people know about your magic.”
0,Eydis reluctantly closed the portal.
0,"She knew the reasoning, but given the alternative, she would rather teleport."
0,"Air travel may be common in this world, but Eydis found it unnerving."
0,The concept of flying through the air in a metal tube was unnatural.
0,"She had to take a plane to the nation’s capital the first time because she had no other way to know where it was, but she used teleportation after that."
0,They soon built her a small personal office in The Pentagon to keep her grounded in one place and close enough to call on when needed.
0,Sean and Miriam shared an apartment only a brief subway ride away and helped Eydis with everything from paperwork to training a select few soldiers that Eydis discovered had affinities to magic.
1,"They left for the airport accompanied by two military personnel and flew to Fort Worth, Texas."
0,"From there, Symra met them with two drivers to chauffeur them to the Federal Medical Center, Carswell."
0,"Symra only took orders from Eydis, not the military or government, so when they requested help in monitoring the two officers that were captured, fearing the potential use of magic to escape, Eydis sent Symra."
0,Symra drew attention from those at the airport.
0,She wore a black suit with matching slacks and white blouse.
0,"Her short, course brown hair stuck out in all directions, and her long, slightly drooping ears that had short, fine brown hair along the top were in full view."
0,Eydis’s ears were likewise uncovered.
0,"Because of the press conference, they no longer had any reason to hide their identity."
0,A smile spread across Symra’s heavily freckled cheeks.
0,"She genuflected, which caused even more people to stare and take pictures."
0,"“I have awaited your arrival, my lady."
0,"Please, come with me.”"
0,"Eydis and one of the military personnel accompanied Symra in the first car with Miriam, Sean, and the other military personnel in the second."
1,The drive to the FMC was silent.
0,"Eydis meditated to control her emotions, and Symra must have realized this because she did not strike up a conversation."
0,"When they arrived, Symra led them through the compound to the high security unit."
0,"“We had eleven women confined here before those two arrived, but they were moved temporarily until something is worked out.” "
0,The guard acting as a guide made idle conversation as they entered the high security compound.
0,“It was more due to having a man in a woman’s prison than the danger those two posed to the other prisoners.
0,The report that came with them said they were very well behaved.”
0,"“Do not let them fool you,” Eydis warned."
0,“Either one of them could kill everyone in this prison with little effort.”
0,The guard gave a wry smile.
0,"The compound was informed of the potential danger the two of them posed, but the guard did not seem to believe the old woman could be capable of much."
0,The nine-foot-tall giant was a different matter.
0,“Sorry that we could not arrange a formal meeting room.
0,Oyak is too weak to leave her bed.
0,"We should be keeping her in one of the medical wings, but the security is a little laxer there, and because Borgrum will not leave her side, we have to take care of her here.”"
0,"Symra stopped in front of a cell, and the guard stood next to her."
0,It was a simple cement room no more than eight feet wide and fifteen feet deep.
0,"The usual prison bed was replaced by a hospital bed, and an elderly woman was strapped into it."
0,"An oxygen line attached to her nose, and an IV ran from her arm."
0,She looked at her visitors with weary glass eyes.
0,"Sitting on the floor next to her and holding her hand was a nine-foot, broad-shouldered giant."
0,"His beard hung low and melded into his ample chest hair, and his long, wavy brown hair was tied back into a ponytail."
0,He eyed Eydis with a menacing frown.
0,Eydis gripped the sleeve of her coat with white knuckles.
0,"The burning pain of adrenaline surged through her veins, and she felt that if she lost even the slightest bit of willpower, she would run them both through with a wind spear."
0,Miriam grabbed Eydis’s hand and held it gently.
0,"Justin’s face flashed in Eydis’s mind, and she shook Miriam’s hand away."
0,There were many questions that Eydis planned to ask.
0,She wanted to know what was happening in her world beyond the small scope of Symra’s slavery.
0,She wanted to know how the humans were able to invade this world and if it was possible to get back.
0,She wanted to know what Jethro’s plans were and why he felt the need to follow her here.
0,She wanted to know the reason for Tolmyur’s invasion of Amel.
0,"All the questions flew from her mind, and only a single word slipped through her mouth."
0,“…why?”
0,Borgrum’s expression did not change.
0,"Eydis doubted a giant had the intellectual faculties to piece together any response to a single-word question without context, but Oyak broke a smile through her cracked lips."
0,"Her voice was no more than a quiet rasp, and without Eydis’s elven ears, she would not have heard the reply."
0,“Because your kind is a disease.”
0,Symra was the only observer who could understand the conversation.
0,Sean and Miriam could only trust that Eydis would find out the information they came for.
0,“He was not from our world.
0,Why did he have to die?” Eydis said.
0,"Oyak’s eyes widened, and a weak cackle escaped her lips."
0,“How fitting that the one who has caused our people so much suffering now has a taste of what sorrow truly is.
0,"If someone you cared for died, it was by your hand, not ours.”"
0,"Eydis raised her hand, but Miriam rushed in front of Eydis to block her, and Borgrum rose to one knee to cover Oyak."
0,Miriam’s eyes pierced Eydis.
0,“Remember our agreement.”
0,"A torrent of anger surged inside Eydis’s bosom, but she lowered her hand."
0,Oyak cackled even harder.
0,“If only Jethro could see how the humans of this world have leashed the Tyrant Princess.
0,To see you reduced to such a pitiful state redeems us of our failure.”
0,“Reduced?
0,"No, you are gravely mistaken."
0,"Because of you, I am stronger now than I ever was in Amel."
0,That city you invaded belongs to the country with the strongest military in this world.
0,They hold the power to render our entire continent uninhabitable.
0,They have decided you are an enemy and have taken my side in this war.”
0,“That will not last.
0,"You will betray these humans like your kind betrayed us, and when that happens, you will have two worlds against you."
0,Only once the elven plague is purged will there be peace.”
0,“The Amelian Empire is not so weak that we would fall to humans.” 
0,A sharp pain pierced Eydis’s head.
0,“While you were living a peaceful life… the Empire fell to ruin!
0,…People live in fear and poverty… while you were laughing and chasing after a man like some bitch in heat…”
0,A broken memory of words spoken in her own voice played in Eydis’s mind.
0,She brought her hand to her head to try to numb the ensuing pain with life magic.
0,"She staggered, and Symra grabbed her arm to support her."
0,"“My lady, we should not drag this on much longer."
0,You are not well.
0,Let us obtain the information we need and leave.”
0,Symra spoke in her home dialect so only Eydis could understand.
0,"Eydis pushed Symra away, but she was right."
0,The pain in her head would not subside.
0,"She placed on a confident mask, and once composed, she stepped closer to the cell."
0,“For what purpose did Jethro send you all here?
0,"The Amelian Empire has fallen, has it not?"
0,How was he able to send such a large army to this world?”
0,“Do you ask a god how and for what reason the sun rises and falls each day?
0,All we do is for the better world Jethro will create for us.
0,We do not question why.”
0,Eydis’s irritation peaked.
0,“I will get no information from zealots.
0,"This is a waste of time,” she sneered to Symra."
0,What did she expect to learn from soldiers who were prepared to die for the commander they worshipped?
0,"“If Jethro desires destruction, then I will give him it."
0,"You call me the Tyrant Princess, so a tyrant I will become."
0,"Just as you seek an end of elfkind, I will see to it that you humans meet your end by my hand.”"
0,"Eydis turned and walked away from the cell, and those with her followed one by one as each person tried to reason about what kind of conversation just transpired."
0,"Before leaving earshot, Oyak cackled a single warning."
0,“Be careful what you say in a world full of those same humans.”
0,"Chapter 6
“Nothing but Trouble”
Ceil"
1,“We will reach the edge of Fiorrae by tomorrow evening.” 
0,"Sammy, Chloe, and Ceil sat around a sunken fire in a small clearing of the forest."
0,Ceil used her staff to create roots that dug out the ground for the fire pit while Chloe gathered and dried wood.
0,"Sammy was left to wash Justin and his clothes with her water magic because he had soiled himself, the reason for their early camp."
0,The sun was low in the sky but had not yet set.
0,"Its waning glow painted the sparse clouds pastel shades of orange, red, and purple."
0,Justin lay next to Sammy with his head in her lap in order to take in the warmth of the flames.
0,"Ceil watched Sammy comb her fingers through Justin’s hair while he breathed weakly, but the black mark on Sammy’s neck continued to steal the focus of her gaze."
0,It had not faded but instead grew ever so slightly over the course of their journey.
0,"Chloe did not seem to notice, and neither did Sammy."
0,Even now Sammy was subconsciously scratching it with the forefinger of her free hand.
0,"Just like the royal guard who pulled Ceil from her hometown and the marshal of the Gallanvale who tried to present her to Jethro, Sammy was also touched by that horrifying phantom hand although using the staff as a conduit, not directly."
0,"The phantom only appeared at periods of heightened emotion, whether fear or anger, to attack those at whom the emotion was directed, although things Ceil used life magic on sometimes blackened without the appearance of that skeletal hand."
0,The number of blackened plants the sprites had to discard while Ceil worked on her garden home was staggering.
0,"The only exceptions were when Ceil used life magic on herself or objects she nurtured with her ven, like her staff, almost making it an extension of herself."
0,"Whatever those black marks were or whatever that hand was, it never harmed her."
0,"Sammy’s case did not appear as severe as the soldier who vomited blood or the marshal whose hand ruptured with seeping blisters, perhaps because the phantom hand did not touch her directly, but in the first case Ceil wanted to be free of the guard, which happened as a direct result of the mark, and in the second case she desperately wanted the marshal to release his grip."
0,The end result was as she desired.
0,What about Sammy?
0,Ceil did not want to admit her mistaken feelings from that time when she thought Sammy was an enemy.
0,"In her hatred, she only had one wish, that Sammy would suffer, slowly and painfully."
0,“What’s on your mind?”
0,Sammy looked back at Ceil with a weary smile.
0,Ceil realized that she had been staring at Sammy.
0,“You are on my mind.
0,You look terrible.
0,"Do you not agree, Chloe?”"
0,Chloe’s eyes startled from being drawn into the sudden conversation.
0,"“Well, um… I don’t have a right to say anything."
0,I pushed myself to collapsing before you found us.”
0,"“All the more reason you should tell Sammy not to,” Ceil sad."
0,“I’m fine.
0,"Really,” Sammy assured them."
0,"“When I first moved out on my own, I initially turned down my dad’s offer to pay for my living expenses, at least until I started school."
0,I ended up working three jobs.
0,This is nothing compared to how tired I was then.
0,"Besides, Justin has it far worse, right?”"
0,"She should give up on him, Ceil murmured in her mind."
0,"He had caused no shortage of trouble during their travels, and many of those troubles were shouldered by Sammy alone."
0,"She fed him, cleaned him, and made every effort to keep him comfortable."
0,"Chloe had to help carry him, but she did not have the same wear in her eyes."
0,Ceil caught Sammy on multiple occasions awake at night in order to tend to him despite knowing that she would have to help carry him come morning.
0,"Throughout all this, Sammy never once complained."
0,Ceil knew nothing of his past or how Sammy was related to him.
0,"Sammy introduced him as Eydis’s lover, but she never said what he was to her."
0,She eyed the two while chewing on a roasted herb.
0,They were both on the short side for general humans but did not look enough alike to be related.
0,She could possibly be another lover of the man’s or perhaps a rival of love with Eydis.
0,"But if they were rivals, they would not be as close of friends as Sammy had expressed."
0,"Even if Sammy was his lover, she was going to break if this continued."
0,"His condition never grew worse, but any day he showed progress, the very next day he regressed back to the state he was the day they set out."
0,"Not once had he become conscious, but looking at the state of his infection, that was probably for the better."
0,This left Sammy to shoulder the full weight of his care.
0,"The conversation ended in awkward silence amid Ceil’s thoughts, and only the crackling of the fire could be heard as the sun slipped below the horizon and the forest grew dark."
0,"Ceil felt there was little reason to stay awake any longer, so she convinced the others to sleep now so they could wake up early and set out at sunup."
0,Their usual sleeping position was Chloe in the center to keep everyone warm with Ceil on her left and Justin on her right.
0,Sammy would then sleep on the other side of Justin to block out the cold.
0,"They had nothing to cover them other than their clothes, but Ceil always made sure to grow soft groundcover to make them comfortable."
0,"As usual, Ceil was the first to fall asleep."
1,“Sammy?”
0,Ceil stirred from a soft voice considerate of those still sleeping.
0,“You still can’t sleep?”
0,“No…” 
0,“Is it Justin?”
0,"Ceil considered getting up to scold Sammy for not resting, but something within her told her to stay silent and listen."
0,"“He’s part of it, but I still can’t get used to the days here."
0,"They’re too long, and I guess I haven’t adjusted yet."
0,"You seem fine, though.”"
0,Chloe chuckled softly.
0,"“I used to be rather lazy, so sleeping for a long time is not hard for me."
0,"The days are pretty long, though.”"
0,“And the high gravity makes lasting the day even harder.”
0,“I’m sure Ceil would be fine if you need to rest more.
0,We could even take a nap in the middle of the day.”
0,“No.
0,We need to get Justin treated as soon as possible.
0,He’s not getting any better.
0,I don’t want to delay the trip any longer than I already have.
0,"Besides, if we are going to be stuck here, I need to get used to the long days.”"
0,“You need to be careful.
0,Ceil is right.
0,You do look terrible.”
0,“I’m fine. Really.”
0,Ceil recalled the first days with them atop the plateau.
0,Their clothing was very peculiar and unlike anything she had ever seen.
0,They did not act like the humans of Tolmyur.
0,"They were not violent, nor did they hate elves."
0,"They knew and were friends with Eydis, so perhaps Eydis realized they were different from those of Tolmyur."
0,They must have come from somewhere far away that was different than the Amelian Empire and the Tolmyur kingdom.
0,Maybe the length of days changed in other locations and the gravity is different.
0,"Ceil had heard that days were long and nights short in the far north, so perhaps they weren’t from the tundra north of the Wilderlands."
0,"She had also heard stories of mountains that floated in faraway continents, so areas of fluctuating gravity did exist."
0,"She had never been anywhere other than her small village or the palace until the assassinations, so other parts of the world could be very different than the Empire."
0,Sammy and Ceil were merely speaking this way because this place was different than some other distant land that had humans.
0,“Where are you going?
0,You are going to wake up Ceil.” Chloe stirred.
0,“Ceil’s a heavy sleeper.
0,I’m just going to meditate for a bit.”
0,“Meditate?” 
0,“Yah. I want to get better at sensing ven.
0,Keep Justin warm for me.
0,I won’t be long.
0,"When I get tired, I’ll come back to bed.”"
0,“Okay…” 
0,Quiet footsteps walked a short distance from the camp.
0,Chloe pulled Justin in closer and breathed a light but frustrated sigh.
0,Her voice was as quiet as a breath.
0,“The problem is that you are too tired to sleep.” 
0,"Ceil thought meditation would help, so she let Sammy be but also planned to scold her in the morning."
1,Ceil woke just before sunrise when the star-speckled black sky was transforming into a dark shade of blue.
0,She left the bed carefully in order to not disturb the still sleeping Chloe beside her.
0,"Justin remained in his deathlike state, but Sammy was not next to him."
0,Ceil glanced around in mild panic and found Sammy sprawled on the ground on the other side of the fire pit.
0,"Fearing the worst, she hurried to Sammy and found her sleeping, but the twitching, mild moans, and tear stains in her eyes showed that her sleep was anything but restful."
0,Ceil placed her hand on Sammy’s cheek.
0,Sammy’s eyes shot open with a shriek.
0,She scampered backwards away from Ceil towards the still-hot ash of yesterday’s fire.
0,Ceil pulled her arm before Sammy could fall into the fire pit and once again felt the incredible weight of this strange human girl.
0,“Sammy.
0,You are fine.
0,It is I.”
0,Sammy’s eyes searched her surroundings and then landed on Ceil.
0,"Her panicked breath slowly regulated, and finally she blinked."
0,She looked around and then back at Ceil.
0,"After a few breaths, Sammy nodded."
0,“I’m okay.
0,I’m okay.
0,"I had a nightmare, that’s all.”"
0,“Nightmare?”
0,Sammy sat next to Ceil and rubbed the sleep from her eyes.
0,"“It was the attack on Gullivan, where we lived before Eydis sent us here."
0,"But, I’m fine."
0,It was only a dream.”
0,Reliving Jethro’s attack.
0,Ceil pulled Sammy into a light embrace.
0,"After she escaped the palace during the assassinations, she had nightmares about the attack on the palace."
0,"After her maid sent her to Fiorrae to escape Jethro once again, she was plagued by constant nightmares of the attack on the Gallanvale as well."
0,"In many of them, she tried to give herself up so that she could die and stop the slaughter of innocent people, but Jethro and the soldiers only ridiculed her or ignored her and continued the slaughter."
0,"After each nightmare, the Sprite Arkhon would envelope her in warmth and lull her to sleep with a gentle breeze."
0,His voice would reassure her that everything would be alright and that she was safe.
0,Ceil stood and pulled Sammy to her feet.
0,"They returned to the natural bed, and Ceil sat down in her spot on the other side of Chloe."
0,Chloe was awake and looking at Sammy with worry.
0,“Are you okay?”
0,“I’m fine.
0,"I just had a nightmare,” Sammy replied."
0,“Again?”
0,“How long have these nightmares persisted?” 
0,Ceil grew irritated that she never noticed.
0,"“Come, you need to rest.” "
0,Ceil patted the bed next to her.
0,“I should be next to Justin to keep him warm.”
0,“No. Forget him for now.
0,Chloe is taking care of that.
0,You need to rest for your own sake.”
0,"There was certainly the possibility that the mark was not only worsening Sammy’s health but also her mental state, exacerbating or even causing the nightmares."
0,"If that was the case, Ceil was responsible, although she could not admit that to Sammy."
0,Sammy looked at Justin and then Ceil.
0,Her hesitation furthered Ceil’s irritation.
0,She grabbed Sammy’s wrist and lead her to her side.
0,Sammy did not argue and lay down on the bed.
0,Ceil removed her own skirt and laid it across Sammy’s shoulders.
0,She then lay down next to Sammy and held Sammy’s head against her bosom.
0,“Rest.
0,We will wait to depart until you wake.”
0,"With a light nod, Sammy closed her eyes."
1,"* * *
Ceil hoped that Sammy would sleep until late morning at least, but the sun was still low in the sky when she woke."
0,"As much as she tried, she could not convince Sammy to continue resting."
0,“We need to get Justin help as soon as possible.”
0,"With that reason alone, Sammy pushed to get ready."
0,Chloe prepared breakfast using the same herbs from the previous evening and some meat that Ceil hunted and had Chloe dry a few days back.
0,"Normally, Ceil would not worry about hunting meat, but Sammy ate as much as two people, and Chloe ate as much as four."
0,Vegetation alone was insufficient for them.
0,"Ceil knew little about human physiology, but she felt the amount of nourishment Sammy and Chloe required was far from normal."
0,"As usual, Ceil walked in front as the guide with Sammy and Chloe carrying Justin a few paces behind."
1,"There were no roads through the uneven and rocky forests of Fiorrae, so Ceil moved by her sense of direction alone."
0,"Once they traveled a ways inside the dryad forests, the forest floors would grow more level, there would be roads used by other races, and finding a dryad settlement would not be too difficult."
0,Ceil held out her fist to stop Sammy and Chloe.
0,She paced slowly while observing their surroundings.
0,"No one was visible, but she knew something was there, watching."
0,"“Ceil, those birds,” Sammy whispered."
0,Ceil turned towards where Sammy was looking and found the same large blue bird with the two long and jagged yellow plumes.
0,“Is that the one from before?” Sammy asked.
0,Ceil was certain.
0,"If there was one, there was sure to be others."
0,The single bird did not pay any attention to Ceil but focused all its attention on Sammy and Chloe.
0,Why did they follow?
0,"Were they still cautious of Sammy and Chloe, or worse?"
0,This was bad.
0,She hurried in front of Sammy and pointed her staff at the bird.
0,The bird lowered his head and rustled his wings in irritation.
0,“These Humans are not dangerous!” Ceil called.
0,"Two large wings extended, and the bird gripped its branch perch with its talons."
0,A single flap sent a powerful gust of wind that knocked Ceil to her back.
0,"Sammy and Chloe were on the edge of the blast, and in Sammy’s exhausted state, she could not hold her ground and fell back."
0,Chloe barely managed to keep Justin from falling out of the stretcher.
0,“Did it attack us?” Chloe asked.
0,Ceil stood back up and again shielded Sammy and Chloe.
0,“No.
0,That was just a warning.
0,"If it was an attack, that wind would have cut.”"
0,The bird continued to ignore Ceil.
0,"From where Ceil was standing, Chloe was behind her on the right and Sammy was behind on the left."
0,The bird was looking just to her left.
0,"These birds were omnivorous, and Sammy was the weakest of the three."
0,"The man was weaker, but they were not carrion scavengers."
0,"“Sammy, stay behind me,” Ceil ordered."
0,“You are its target.”
0,“Me?” Sammy staggered to her feet.
0,"Instead of listening to Ceil, she stood beside Ceil and started pushing her away."
0,“What are you doing!
0,You are his target!”
0,"Ceil looked up at the bird, and his head cocked to the side."
0,He no longer showed any hostility and just observed.
0,“Leave him alone.
0,He only attacked because you confronted him.
0,There’s nothing wrong with him watching us.”
0,“They are predators.
0,I am worried that one might attack you!”
0,Sammy smiled.
0,"“When that happens, I’ll trust you and Chloe to save me.”"
0,Sammy looked back at the bird and nodded while pushing Ceil further away.
0,Ceil watched dumbfounded at Sammy’s complete lack of concern for her own safety as she returned to help Chloe with Justin.
0,"After a few steps, Sammy fell to her knees."
0,Chloe again struggled to make sure Justin did not fall out of the stretcher.
0,The bird began to rustle his wings while watching Sammy.
0,"Ceil hurried over, not to confront the potentially dangerous predator, but lift Sammy."
0,“That is enough.
0,You are not allowed to carry him anymore.”
0,Sammy looked at Ceil with shock and worry.
0,“We can’t leave Justin behind!”
0,Ceil loathed the words that she was about to speak.
0,“I will help Chloe carry him.” 
0,She grabbed the front of the stretcher and lifted it.
0,"As she expected, the body was rather heavy."
0,"He was within what she felt was a tolerable carrying weight, but she was still amazed that Sammy and Chloe had carried him for so long."
0,Even she would grow exhausted.
0,Ceil watched out for the bird in the corner of her eye while they walked away.
1,"Once the bird was out of sight, she heard the large flap and rustle of leaves that signaled the bird’s departure, a temporary departure, she was sure."
0,Six more similar flaps sounded from unseen locations around them.
0,The birds increased in number.
0,This worried Ceil even more.
0,"“Sammy, you are no longer allowed to take care of him,” Ceil ordered."
0,“Why?!”
0,“I forbid it until you recover.
0,"If you break before you find him help, I will have no other choice but to leave him behind and carry you on the stretcher instead."
0,Is that what you want?”
0,“You can’t make that decision!
0,And Chloe won’t leave Justin behind either!”
0,“This decision is mine to make because I am the one guiding you.
0,Either you rest or we leave him.”
0,“What do you have against Justin!?”
0,Ceil set down the stretcher.
0,“This is not about him.
0,It is about you.
0,I am worried about you.
0,Chloe is too.
0,She recognized that you have been too tired to even sleep well.”
0,"“You don’t need to speak for me,” Chloe protested."
0,“Am I wrong?” Ceil glared at Chloe.
0,"“No, but…”"
0,"Content with Chloe’s reply, Ceil grabbed Sammy by the shirt."
0,"“Until you recover, I forbid you from taking care of him."
0,"I will tend to his injury, and cleaning up after him will be Chloe’s responsibility from now on.”"
0,“I can’t make Chloe do that!
0,She hasn’t seen a naked man before.
0,She can’t even look while I wash Justin.
0,There is no way she’ll be able to do it herself.”
0,"“You cannot be serious,” Ceil groaned."
0,“Can you both stop speaking for me?!” 
0,Chloe’s face flushed pink.
0,Ceil and Sammy stared at her in stunned silence.
0,“I’ll do it.
0,I can handle it.
0,I’m not a child.
0,I don’t want you to exhaust yourself or get sick either.
0,Ceil is right.
0,"I pushed myself until I collapsed, and I regret forcing you to take care of me because of that."
0,"We can’t take care of both you and Justin, not in the middle of nowhere.”"
0,“Then it is decided.
0,"Once you are better, you and Chloe can trade off and share the burden of taking care of him."
0,The three of us can take rotations carrying him.
0,We still have ten to fifteen days depending on how quickly we can find a dryad settlement.
0,Endure this arrangement until then.”
0,"Ceil lifted her end of the stretcher and continued walking, not giving Sammy a moment to argue."
0,"Chapter 7
“A Dangerous Mistake”
Sammy"
1,“How do you cope with your nightmares?” Sammy asked Chloe.
0,She leaned on her arm to watch Justin beside her.
0,"Just a moment earlier, she had another nightmare of the attack on Gullivan, and the jolt when she woke pushed Justin into Chloe, waking her."
0,"“I haven’t been getting them too often, but…” "
0,Chloe leaned back to look at the dark night sky.
0,"The low cloud cover blocked out the stars and threatened rain, but Ceil assured them before they slept that rain was unlikely."
0,“I guess it’s because I got them a lot as a kid?”
0,“Why?” 
0,“I don’t know.
0,"I was scared of everything, and my parents thought that attributed to my nightmares."
0,"As I got older, they happened less, but I still get them from time to time."
0,"More than the average person, I think.”"
0,“So you got used to them?” 
0,"“No, that’s not it."
0,I found my own way of coping that works for me.
0,You know how I like writing?
0,That started because of my nightmares.
0,"When I was maybe 12 or 13, I decided to write down my nightmares."
0,I have a few journals full of them now.”
0,“You just write them down?” 
0,“Not exactly.
0,I write them how I would have done the story.
0,I change my nightmare into the story I want.
0,"Nightmares tend to repeat, right?"
0,"I found out that by doing that, I could sometimes change what happens in the nightmare.” Chloe chuckled lightly."
0,“Nightmares feel more like challenges to me now.
0,"My nightmares are mostly lucid, so I can actively change what is happening."
0,It doesn’t always work… maybe half of the time I win?”
0,Sammy lay down on her side and snuggled up against Justin.
0,She placed her hand on his chest and felt the slow rise and fall.
0,"In her nightmare, Justin was shot in the heart by Jethro and died instantly."
0,"Jethro then proceeded to shoot Chloe, Eydis, and Miriam."
0,She woke when he pressed the gun against her forehead and pulled the trigger.
0,“My dreams aren’t even lucid.
0,It feels like it’s really happening.
0,I don’t remember coming to Whinhlem.
0,I don’t remember meeting Ceil or the sprites.
0,All I remember is the attack and that we were trying to find Eydis.
0,I don’t know if that will work for me.
0,I don’t have an imagination like yours.”
0,"“Well,” Chloe began but then fell silent for a moment."
0,"“You might have to find your own way to deal with it, but I’ll help think of ideas too.”"
0,“Thanks.”  
0,“Mm-hmm.”
1,"The next morning, Sammy was back on Justin duty."
0,This was the third day she and Chloe began alternating.
0,"In the beginning of the eight days Sammy was barred from taking care of Justin, Chloe was an embarrassed wreck."
0,"Each time she had to bathe him or clean up after him, she was red as a tomato for the remainder of the day."
0,"Sammy still provided water to wash Justin if there was no stream nearby, but other than that, she was forbidden from helping Chloe."
0,Ceil made Sammy rest whenever they had to stop for any Justin-related issue.
0,"She felt that Sammy should wait longer before being allowed to take care of Justin again, but when Chloe began showing signs of exhaustion, Ceil gave Sammy permission, and the alternating shifts began."
0,"Ceil would then swap out carrying Justin with whoever she felt was becoming too weak, usually Sammy."
0,Ceil grabbed the front of the stretcher.
0,“I’ll be carrying him with Chloe today.”
0,“Are you sure?” Sammy asked.
0,“You did not sleep again last night.
0,I can see it on your face.”
0,“Neither did Chloe.
0,We were talking together.”
0,“She looks more rested.
0,"It was a nightmare again, right?"
0,You need to get those under control.”
0,“It’s not that easy.” 
0,“Yes it is.
0,I was able to.
0,"So can you,” Ceil assured, but her assurance was rather curt, lacking sympathy."
0,"Ceil began walking, so Chloe was forced to follow."
0,Sammy fought to control her irritation and jogged to catch up to walk next to Justin.
1,They continued walking through the morning and past midday.
0,“See how the trees are changing?” Ceil asked.
0,Sammy looked around at the trees.
0,"The huge, leafy trees that would not feel out of place in a more tropical climate were being overtaken by rough-barked, smaller-leafed trees that looked more at home in a temperate climate."
0,"For the first time, Sammy noticed mushrooms growing on the ground, and the moss that was formerly leafier was now coarse and clung evenly over the trunks and branches of the trees."
0,"“This is the sure sign we have reached the dryad territory, Dhuillir."
0,"There are sixteen states within Dhuillir, each with a different clan of dryad."
0,Dhuillir means ‘many colors’ in Elven.
0,"Clans are defined by the type of plants they pollinate with which gives each clan a distinct appearance, but there is some intermixing."
0,"They cultivate their specific trees within their state, making the forests a patchwork of color and the borders between tribes easily recognizable."
0,"All the colonies were united under the Grandmatriarch Hamadryads, but they were assassinated the same night as the royal family."
0,"After the failure of the two clans bordering Amel in defending it from the humans, all the clans isolated themselves to protect their own clan, and one by one, they quickly surrendered to Jethro without a fight.”"
0,“What clan’s state are we in right now?” Chloe asked.
0,"“There are two possibilities, but this is most likely Melia."
0,"Their skin is more grey than brown or green, and their hair is curly like the moss-looking growth on these trees."
0,"It is not moss, though."
0,That is where the tree flowers.
0,There was one of these trees in the palace garden.
0,"When they bloom, their trunks and branches are covered in tiny white flowers."
0,"Dryad hair always matches the most dominant flowering tree of their region, so Melian hair looks the same.”"
0,Sammy ran up and grasped Ceil’s hand holding the stretcher.
0,“Are they kind?
0,Will they help Justin?”
0,“I have never met them.
0,All I know about the dryads is secondhand.
0,"Even if they are helpful, we will still need to be careful."
0,Melia borders the fairy nation of Vallen… or what remains of it…”
1,"* * *
“Is that a road?” Sammy ran ahead of Ceil and Chloe to a break in the trees."
0,"It was no more than packed and hardened soil, but the five-meter-wide path traveled in both directions until it curved out of sight."
0,“It is a road!”
0,Chloe and Ceil appeared from the forest and set Justin down on the roadside.
0,Ceil joined Sammy on the road to have a better look at the soil.
0,“This road is either being maintained or it is well traveled.”
0,"“That’s a good thing, right?” Chloe asked from the roadside."
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“Dryads do not use roads.
0,Dhuillir only has them for the convenience of other races.” 
0,She walked over to the edge of the road near Chloe and stomped her heel into the dirt.
0,“This road has been widened as well.
0,The dirt here is less packed.”
0,“You’re saying that someone other than the dryads needed to widen the road?” Chloe asked after making certain Justin was comfortable and not in need of any care.
0,“I can only think it is the humans.
0,No other race would need to travel out this far or have any need to widen a road for increased traffic.”
0,“Will it still lead us to a village?” Sammy pleaded to Ceil for hope.
0,"A road used by humans would be dangerous to travel, but roads also led to civilization, and Justin needed care as soon as possible."
0,"“It should, perhaps, but we need to--” "
1,Ceil grabbed Sammy’s wrist and pulled her off the road.
0,She grabbed Justin’s stretcher and drug it into the brush.
0,Chloe quickly followed.
0,Sammy poked her head out from the brush to look down the road.
0,“What is it?”
0,“Quiet.” Ceil pulled Sammy back down.
0,“They likely already saw us.
0,We need to leave. Fast.”
0,She grabbed the stretcher but then froze before lifting it up.
0,Sammy could hear a single pair of running steps in the distance that grew silent before drawing near.
0,"Chloe held her hands against her mouth, and Ceil swiveled her head to try to find an angle where she could see through the brush without making any movements that would give her away."
0,Sammy’s heart pulsed with fearful adrenaline.
0,"Even though the one who noticed them moved silently, the soft, precise steps in the dirt grew just audible as it neared."
0,"Through a small break in the brush, Sammy saw him."
0,A man armored in leather carried a short bow with an arrow nocked in the string.
0,His light clothing and soft leather footwear muffled his movements.
0,"After two more steps, the man disappeared."
0,"Only his light steps remained, searching."
0,He was not leaving and not moving further down the road.
0,He knew they were near.
0,"Sammy shot glances at Ceil and Chloe, and her panic increased when she noticed steam rising from Chloe."
0,"Without making any noise, she motioned with her hand for Chloe to calm down."
0,"If Chloe created any smoke, their cover would be blown."
0,Fear became dread when an unknown number of footsteps hurried near from down the road.
0,The single man was only a scout for the main group.
0,Even Ceil began losing her composure and displayed the same fear as Sammy and Chloe.
0,"The silent footsteps approached the group and nearly inaudible words were spoken in a coarse, guttural language."
0,Armored feet then spread out over the road.
0,The sound of metal being removed from sheaths sent beads of cold sweat dripping down Sammy’s forehead.
0,The wooden creak of a bow being drawn.
0,Light footsteps nearing the shrubs where they hid.
0,"The arrow released, and a shrill cry rang out over the road."
0,Twigs snapped and leaves rustled until something hit the forest floor not too far from them.
0,"It was partially hidden between the trees, but Sammy recognized the blue plumage."
0,A single yellow feather sprouted from its head.
0,Chaos ensued.
0,Large flapping wings broke up the branches of the trees and sent them cascading down onto the forest floor.
0,Sammy covered Justin while Ceil and Chloe covered their own heads.
0,Surprised shouts accompanied frantic magic cast by the human soldiers.
0,The shrill “kree” of the birds intermixed with the cries of the soldiers.
0,"Sammy did not know the numbers on either side of the fight, but by the number of cries and diminishing voices, the humans were losing more people."
0,"A fireball exploded only a few yards from Sammy, and the concussion and heat suffocated her."
0,"Near the explosion, two of the large birds lay charred and immobile."
0,"“We need to leave,” Ceil whispered, but Sammy’s ears were ringing so loud she could barely hear her."
0,“We will take advantage of the fight.”
0,Ceil lifted a thicker branch that had fallen across her back and looked through the brush at the battle.
0,“They are evenly matched right now.
0,This is our best chance.
0,"If the humans win, we will not be able to leave without being spotted, and more will come.”"
0,"Sammy lifted her head to risk a glance at the battle, but Ceil pulled her back down."
0,She was only able to see about ten human soldiers and maybe five of the birds.
0,"Including the three she knew were killed already, the number of those birds had increased again."
0,“Grab the stretcher.
0,"On my signal, we move slowly into the forest.”"
0,"“Shouldn’t we run,” Chloe asked."
0,“No.
0,That will draw too much attention to us.
0,"They still have mages, and maybe an archer or two."
0,All it would take is for one of them to send an attack our way.”
0,Ceil raised her head to look at the battle.
0,Sammy and Chloe grabbed the ends of the stretcher and waited.
0,"When Ceil lifted her fist, they moved."
0,"They kept low to the ground, but now that they were away from the brush, Sammy got a clearer picture of the graphic scene."
0,Many human and bird corpses bloodied the packed soil.
0,"The humans were down to six, and Sammy could only see two of the birds, the largest of which had two long and jagged yellow plumes sprouting from its head."
0,Sammy stopped moving.
0,Images of Jethro’s soldiers cutting down innocent people trying to flee the hospital flooded into her mind.
0,"The longer she watched, the more her body began to shake."
0,One of the birds acted as a decoy to draw the fire by swooping down and cutting at the legs of some of the humans with its wing.
0,"They turned to attack it, but then a large blade of wind launched by the bird Sammy knew cut into three of the soldiers and dropped them to the ground."
0,"The bird that acted as a decoy took an arrow to the back and fell onto the side of the road, flailing momentarily before growing still."
0,This angered another of the birds that Sammy had not noticed who dove down from the nearby trees and clawed at a soldier’s face with its talons.
0,"The natural weapons dug into the man’s neck and tore out flesh, but the bird’s rage was rewarded with a blade to its breast by the soldier next to it."
0,"“What are you doing?” Ceil tried to coax Sammy forward, but she wouldn’t move."
0,"“They are going to lose,” Sammy said."
0,“That’s not our problem.”
0,All that remained on the human side was an archer and swordsman.
0,On the bird’s side was the male with the two yellow plumes.
0,"The archer nocked an arrow and fired as the bird tried to maneuver away, but the distance was too short, and the arrow hit its mark through the wing into the bird’s shoulder."
1,Sammy set Justin down and ran.
0,The soldier rushed to the downed bird fluttering on the ground and raised his sword.
0,"The bird swung its free wing, and a blade of wind severed the soldier’s wrists mid downward swing and dissipated after cutting partway into the soldier’s neck."
0,"The blade fell, severing a few feathers, but causing no more harm."
0,The archer nocked another arrow.
0,Sammy broke out of the brush onto the road with her sword raised.
0,The bowstring was drawn.
0,"The archer took notice of Sammy’s charge and changed his aim, but he had no time."
0,She swung down with all her might.
0,The archer was forced to block the attack with his bow.
0,The wooden weapon buckled and snapped from the string’s tension.
0,Sammy lost her footing in her ill-formed attack and fell to the ground as another blade of wind flew over her into the archer.
0,"When Sammy looked up, the headless man crumbled to the ground."
0,She turned to the crying bird.
0,"Its right wing was stuck against its chest by the arrow, and it flailed on the ground with its left wing."
1,“What are you doing?!” 
0,"Ceil appeared from the forest, furious."
0,“He’s hurt!” Sammy called back.
0,“Leave him!
0,We need to flee far from here before more humans arrive!”
0,Sammy approached the bird but was knocked back by a strong wind from the bird’s left wing.
0,“Hold still!
0,I’m trying to help!”
0,The earsplitting cries from the bird made Sammy’s head ache.
0,She approached again.
0,"The bird’s left wing was about to flap, so Sammy dove on top."
0,She pressed the wing down with her right hand and straddled the bird with her legs.
0,"It continued to cry and bite franticly, so Sammy grabbed its beak with her other hand."
0,“Quiet!” she ordered.
0,The bird looked up at her with his large round eyes.
0,Sammy’s body shook with adrenaline.
0,The smell of blood from the many corpses behind her made her nauseous.
0,She took a deep breath with closed eyes to try and regain composure.
0,"“I’m trying to help you, so stop struggling.” "
0,"Sammy removed her hand from his beak, and he cried."
0,She immediately grabbed it again and stared into its eyes.
0,"“Stop,” she ordered again."
0,"After she released his beak, he did not cry out again."
0,"Feeling it safe, she lifted her hand from his wing and inspected the arrow."
0,"From how she was straddling the bird, she was crushing some of the feathers of the right wing that was pinned by the arrow to his chest."
0,"The arrow had penetrated the flesh of the wing, and the tip had passed clean through the shoulder just under the wing."
0,"The bird could not free himself, because the arrowhead caught on its back, and his wing caught on the fletching."
0,“Don’t leave me behind!” 
0,Chloe drug the stretcher with Justin out onto the road.
0,"“Chloe, bring me the pouch!” Sammy ordered."
0,Chloe looked around at the devastation of the battle and stepped nervously over to Sammy.
0,She handed Sammy the pouch that had formerly held the strange grass and medicine.
0,Sammy loosened the ties and removed a vial containing a light brown liquid: condensed beiju juice.
0,"It was not as strong as the former medicine the vial contained because it had not sat long enough to ferment and lacked other medicinal herbs, but it was more effective than raw beiju."
0,“You are going to use it on the bird?” Ceil watched in disbelief.
0,Sammy paused again to regain her composure in order to rid her mind of the images of the attack on the hospital that the putrid smell of iron in the air kept bringing to her memory.
0,"“I made it, so I get to choose how I use it.” "
0,She took another deep breath.
0,“I can make more later.”
0,"“Even if you remove the arrow, that medicine is not going to heal the wound."
0,He will not be able to hunt.
0,He will not survive.
0,You are wasting your time.”
0,“Can you stop the bleeding?
0,"There are two bones in the wing right here, and the arrow is caught between them."
0,I’m going to tear the three feathers off the arrow and slide the wing off.
0,"Chloe, hold the wing.”"
0,"Chloe grabbed the wing on each side of where the arrow penetrated, and Sammy tore off the fletching as best she could."
0,Chloe then helped Sammy slide the wing off the arrow.
0,"The bird cried out when his wing passed the rough fletching, but the wing was free."
0,Sammy lifted herself off the bird a little to slide out the wing she was sitting on.
0,"The bird was about the flap, so Sammy placed both her hands on his wings to press them to the ground."
0,She stared back into its eyes.
0,“I’m not done yet.” 
0,Sweat caused by Sammy’s internal turmoil and the exhaustion of her drastic actions dripped onto the bird’s beak from the tip of her nose.
0,"“Ceil, the wing.”"
0,Ceil walked behind the bird and was about to press her fingers on the wound but hesitated.
0,Her hand shook.
0,"She had refused to use any healing magic on Justin, only checking his vitals with life magic and then applying herbal medicine."
0,"When Sammy began to worry that Ceil would not stop the bleeding, Ceil took a shallow breath and quickly tapped her fingers on the wound."
0,She then did the same where the arrow protruded from its shoulder.
0,"“I think I stopped the bleeding,” Ceil said."
0,“Let me see your sash.”
0,Ceil frowned but untied the sash from her waist.
0,Sammy used the sash to wrap around the bird to hold its right wing closed.
0,She then touched the arrow and pulled lightly.
0,The bird cried out and squirmed beneath her.
0,“How do we remove the arrow?” Sammy asked.
0,"“Move,” Ceil ordered."
0,Ceil and Sammy quickly swapped places.
0,Ceil sat lower on the bird to allow Sammy to lean his head forward.
0,"“Break off the arrowhead,” Ceil instructed."
0,"“The quicker the snap, the cleaner it will be."
0,"Once you do, I will remove the shaft.”"
0,"From where Sammy now sat ahead of the bird, the road full of corpses was in full view."
0,She immediately looked away and fought her vomit reflex.
0,"“Do it now, or I will get off,” Ceil said."
0,Sammy nodded and grabbed the arrowhead.
0,She pulled it through a bit further so she could snap it off where it was attached to the shaft.
0,She gripped the shaft near the bird’s back with one hand and gripped near the arrowhead with the flat side braced against the base of her palm in her other hand.
0,"Using all her strength, she bent the arrowhead down."
0,"The break was not clean, and the arrowhead cut her palm a little, but the head broke off."
0,Ceil immediately yanked the shaft out.
0,"In a panic, the bird flapped its left wing and blew Ceil backwards into the air."
0,She landed hard on her back with her skirt flipped up.
0,“You stupid buzzard!
0,We are helping you!” Ceil screamed.
0,She held her tails in front of her and rubbed them while shivering and wincing in pain.
0,She had landed on them.
0,Sammy quickly straddled the bird to apply her medicine to the wound in its shoulder.
1,"The brush further back on the other side of the road rustled, and then a man ran in the opposite direction."
0,Ceil let go of her tails and grabbed a bow and a few arrows from a fallen soldier.
0,"She nocked an arrow, drew the bow, and fired at the man."
0,Her arrow flew far left of her target.
0,“Chloe!
0,Kill him!” Ceil screamed.
0,"Not knowing what was happening, Chloe ran beside Ceil and conjured a viscous fireball in her hand while Ceil fired another poorly aimed arrow."
0,"Chloe tossed the ball that spat out flames as the added ven propelled it forward, but the man was too far away for the ball to hit."
0,"It exploded on the road well behind its target, and the erupting flames of the explosion that was wider than the road threatened to catch the nearby trees on fire."
0,"Chloe pursued, and the lone man soon ran out of sight when the road bent."
0,“No.
0,This cannot be happening.” 
0,Ceil paced in a circle.
0,“This cannot be happening!”
0,She ran to Sammy and pulled her up by her arm.
0,The bird no longer struggled and only sat on his back.
0,“Do you have any idea what you have done?!
0,You should have listened to me!
0,We should have fled!
0,I was seen!
0,"Not as some High Elf living in the woods, not as some elf acting as a guide for two humans."
0,I am the only elf anywhere near my age with two tails on the entire continent!”
0,Sammy’s face grew pale.
0,"“Oh, shit…”"
0,Ceil continued pacing in a circle.
0,“We are in Melia.
0,"For all they know, I could have fled here from Vallen."
0,The dryads already surrendered to Tolmyur.
0,If they think the Melians were hiding me in secret and only feigning servitude… 
0,"No, if they think the Melians and I sent those birds to attack the soldiers…” "
0,Ceil shook uncontrollably.
0,She fell to her knees and gripped her arms.
0,"Her nails dug in, and fresh blood dripped down her arm."
0,“This will be another genocide.
0,"First the fairies, now the dryads."
0,I was right.
0,I bring death wherever I go.
0,How many more are going to die because of me?
0,How many more?
0,How many?”
0,Sammy peeled away Ceil’s hands.
0,“Stop!
0,You are hurting yourself.”
0,Ceil’s bulging eyes did not see Sammy.
0,They hollowly looked through her into a dark memory.
0,“I never should have left Fiorrae.
0,I never should have escaped the palace.
0,I should have died there.
0,I…”
0,Sammy pulled Ceil into a tight embrace.
0,“It’s okay.
0,This is not your fault.
0,Jethro is the cause of all this.
0,You cannot control what he does.”
0,"Ever since the first day she met Ceil, Sammy had the impression that Ceil was a resilient and levelheaded woman to an annoying, almost arrogant degree."
0,"For the first time, she saw Ceil as a frail girl who had been through the same if not far worse than Sammy had in the fall of Gullivan and was still battling desperately within herself to cope with the trauma."
0,“I couldn’t keep up with him.
0,He’s too fast.” 
0,Chloe looked at Sammy embracing the shivering elf.
0,“What happened?”
0,"Sammy explained the situation, and as she did, the color slowly drained from Chloe’s face as well."
0,“We have to warn them!
0,They won’t even know why they are being attacked!” Chloe shouted.
0,"Ceil’s breath froze, and she looked up at Chloe with ghastly horror."
0,Chloe panicked and tried to comfort Ceil.
0,“No.
0,It’s not your fault.
0,Really!”
0,"“You’re right, though,” Sammy agreed."
0,“We need to warn as many dryads as we can.
0,"We don’t know if Tolmyur will attack, but if they do, the dryads need to be prepared.”"
0,Sammy placed her hand on Ceil’s cheek and turned her head up to look her in the eyes.
0,"Ceil’s eyes were wrinkled in anguish, but not a single tear fell."
0,“Can you walk?” 
0,Sammy grabbed Ceil’s hand and lifted her to her feet.
0,Ceil leaned on Sammy for support as Sammy led her in the direction the soldier fled.
0,"If any villages were to be targeted due to their mistake, the first would be those in the direction the soldiers appeared."
0,"“Sorry Chloe, but can you drag Justin for a while until Ceil calms down?"
0,It should be easier on the road.”
0,“Yah.” Chloe hurried over to where she left Justin on the roadside and lifted the front of the stretcher.
0,Am I forgetting something?
0,Sammy stopped and looked over her shoulder.
0,The bird was still on his back watching Sammy walk away.
0,“Are you going to just lay there?
0,"You can’t fly, so I’ll help you until you can.”"
0,"The bird cocked his head, and Sammy sighed."
0,She beckoned the bird to follow and then continued walking.
0,He flapped his free wing to right himself and then tried to fly.
0,The burst of wind from his lone wing sent him rolling over the road to the right.
0,He cried a loud “kree!” after Sammy.
0,"She turned her head to look at his large, pleading eyes."
0,“You are going to have to walk.” 
0,She pointed to her feet and stamped them to help the bird understand.
0,He once again righted himself and after a few light steps began trotting to catch up.
0,Sammy’s first impressions were not wrong.
0,The bird was intelligent.
0,"Chapter 8
“A Delicate Situation”
Byurk"
1,Soldiers pitched crude leather tents in file where possible between the small-leafed yet large trees.
0,Much of the groundcover was trampled flat by the many boots running around preparing camp.
0,The organized chaos was something Captain Byurk knew well.
0,He could tell by the movements of his men that they were progressing smoothly and that camp would we ready within the hour.
0,"Before they arrived, the forest clearing was idyllic, like a well nurtured garden without so much as a rock or mushroom out of place."
0,"Those familiar with dryads would have recognized this as a village, and now the dryads were standing still with worried expressions watching the soldiers trample their home."
0,They did not move for fear of getting in someone’s way and angering them.
0,"Dryad villages made the perfect camps because they were mostly located in clearings with sparse trees, little ground cover, and plenty of space because dryads had no need of structures."
0,Only a few of the larger villages in Dhuillir had physical structures for the convenience of other races.
0,A small village in Melia on the edge of dryad territory would have no need for such accommodations.
0,This also removed the need to evict residents.
0,The soldiers could simply pitch their tents in the plentiful open space.
0,One young dryad a little shorter than Byurk looked at him with fearful eyes while clinging to the leg of her mother.
0,He walked over to the child.
0,The mother directed her child behind her legs.
0,Byurk flashed a simple smile.
0,“Do not be scared.
0,"We are only passing through,” he said."
0,The fear in the child’s eyes grew when Byurk spoke.
0,His attempt to calm her had no effect.
0,"He spoke to her in Elven, but the child did not understand."
0,"Her mother rubbed the child’s short, mossy hair and lifted her up to hold her and reassure her in the Melian language."
0,"I know this is the middle of nowhere, but you should teach your child the main political language of your empire."
0,"Normally, few would find reason to travel through Melia, and there was nothing in the Melian forests to attract merchants or travelers."
0,The only reason the soldiers were marching through was because this was the most direct route from Amel to the last remaining fairy cities north of Dhuillir in western Vallen.
0,"Jethro had stated that Lieutenant Soppet was having trouble with the remaining fairy resistance, but Byurk received word while at the Amelian Palace that six major fairy cities had been destroyed, not to mention the many villages in-between them."
0,"However, Lieutenant Soppet’s forces were now running low on supplies, and they had lost many good men."
0,"The fairies spoiled any food or other resources as they fled, and this had severely weakened the offense."
0,What Byurk and his men brought with them was not only reinforcements but also much needed provisions.
0,"These could have been teleported directly by Jethro as they had in the past, but with Jethro personally involved in the campaign to find the First Princess of Amel in some other world, he was not able to provide support."
0,"The spatial mages in Amel had also fled, so there were none whom the commanders stationed there could order to send the resources."
0,This left Byurk the task of bringing aid to the weary soldiers on his return from recovering from a major injury sustained in an assassination attempt by the fairies.
1,Fires lit one by one around the camp as the sun set over the forest canopy.
0,"Still, this is taking far too long on foot."
0,Byurk owed his life to the men still fighting on the frontlines.
0,The assassination attempt had nearly been successful.
0,"A flying fairy had flown over his camp at night and drove a long, wind-imbued spear through the ceiling of his tent."
0,"The aim was lucky and impaled the side of his right breast, pinning him to the ground."
0,He would not have survived the journey to Dhuillir to receive aid from the dryads.
0,His men used all means possible to sustain him and keep him alive until word reached Jethro and Jethro could teleport him to the Amelian Palace for treatment.
0,"Those same men were running low on resources, and his convoy would still take another twenty days or more at their current pace."
0,"The Amelian Empire lacked domesticated pack animals, and there were far too few in Tolmyur to support the military."
0,"What few of those lumbering desert beasts that existed were formerly in the possession of the military until Jethro became Commanding General and felt they had more purpose in the hands of farmers, stating that he would transport supplies as needed."
0,"Even if there were more available in Tolmyur that could be spared, without Jethro they had no means to transport them to Amel."
0,The largest flaw of their assault on Amel with Jethro’s aid was that they had not obtained a supply line from Tolmyur.
0,The Stollmuk Kingdom that acted as a barrier between Tolmyur and Amel was not outright hostile--they even traded with the dwarves--but they refused entry for any military or other large groups from Tolmyur.
0,"They could not force their way through because the Stollmuk Kingdom was similar in strength to Amel despite its size, and they were still at full power."
0,Jethro was their only connection to their homeland.
1,"The sun fully set, and the final tent was pitched, Byurk’s."
0,He quickly inspected it before joining his men for their meager dinner.
0,Their meals were rationed in order to save as much of their provisions as possible.
0,The chefs prepared a simple thin broth soup containing a single strip of dried meat and a few chunks of diced spuds.
0,"As a small gesture of hospitality and plea for mercy, the village matriarch offered the soldiers herbal water she claimed would help with fatigue and also offered the women of the village to service the soldiers if desired."
0,Byurk accepted the water without fear of any foul play but declined the service.
0,"His men would protest, but on their rationed food, they needed to conserve as much energy as possible."
0,The last thing he needed was for his men to be fatigued during their march the next day because they were up all night with women.
0,The gesture was enough for him.
0,The other states in Dhuillir provided no support for his men.
0,Some made no attempt to hide their contempt and rancor.
0,The Melians were different.
0,Every village in Melia had provided services or food so that they had less need to use the important supplies they carried.
0,"Melian hospitality was better than anywhere Byurk had ever visited in Tolmyur, Amel, or elsewhere."
0,"They were an honest, goodly people, and for that he was grateful."
1,"After dinner, Byurk gave the soldiers momentary free time before retiring for bed."
0,The fires roared with light revelry as the men admired the many naked dryads scattered around the camp.
0,"Dryads were similar in body to High Elves and thus similar to human women, so quite a number of his men did not mind the differences."
0,"They beckoned the women to join them, but the dryads left the soldiers alone at Byurk’s order."
0,"During this time, Byurk inspected the cargo for damage or theft."
0,The task was long and monotonous because each soldier had their own pack that they had to carry.
0,This also meant that stealing a small portion of rations from one’s own pack would be difficult to notice.
0,"To counter this, each pack of like equipment or food had the same supply count."
0,He only needed to check that count against the number on the ledger.
0,"With the aid of twenty of his most trusted and educated men, counting the five thousand individual packs required a couple hours, but he only took inventory once every four days."
1,"By the time he finished, the bustle of the camps had died down, and the soldiers were retiring to their tents."
0,Byurk’s final task was enforcing the curfew so that his men received adequate rest.
0,He walked among the tents and urged his men to hurry to bed.
0,He was halfway through when he heard some commotion from the far side of the village near where the road passed.
0,“Captain!
0,Captain Byurk!”
0,"Hearing his name from the panicked shout, Byurk hastened to the edge of the camp."
0,He was met by a winded and sweating scout he had sent with a mobile forward party tasked with scouting out potential threats and informing Lieutenant Soppet of his arrival with supplies.
0,The only reason a scout would return was if some disaster had befallen the party.
0,“Come to my tent.
0,We had best not talk in the open.”
0,The scout and Byurk’s lieutenant joined him in his tent.
0,Byurk sat on a simple fur folded on the ground.
0,The lieutenant and scout knelt in front of him.
0,“Take a moment to breathe and collect your thoughts.
0,Whatever has happened can wait a moment to be told.”
0,The scout took a few deep breaths and shook his head.
0,“I fear this cannot wait even a moment.
0,I found the widow of the emperor.”
0,“You what?” Byurk could not believe the report.
0,"He trusted this scout, or he would not have sent him with the forward party, but to suddenly run into the one woman that much of the army stationed in the Amelian Empire was searching for without success felt too much like a drunken hallucination."
0,“Is she in the custody of your company?
0,Or perhaps killed?”
0,"Again, the scout shook his head."
0,“No.
0,We were attacked by a flock of those buzzards.
0,Our ranger noticed some people traveling the road and ran ahead to intercept.
0,"The people hid, and in the search, he noticed one of those buzzards."
0,"We had been clearing them from the road along the way to ensure the safety of your convoy, and there were usually only one or two, but this time there were far too many."
0,Our entire company was wiped out.”
0,“Was the wife among the people the ranger spotted?” the lieutenant asked.
0,“How was he sure it was the wife?”
0,"“We killed all but one of them birds, but a woman jumped out from the brush with a sword to save the last one.” "
0,“The wife?” the lieutenant asked.
0,"“I know you are eager, but let him finish,” Byurk reprimanded."
0,"“No, a human woman, or maybe half dwarf."
0,"A High Elf and another woman appeared after, and they worked together to treat the bird."
0,I feel it was them who set them birds on us.
0,"During the treatment, I saw that the High Elf had two tails."
0,She held each one individually.
0,I saw it as clearly as I see you now.”
0,"“And instead of killing her right then, you fled?!”"
0,Byurk placed his hand on the lieutenant’s shoulder.
0,“Calm yourself.
0,You know very well the scouts are under strict instruction not to engage no matter what happens to the company.
0,"They are to observe, survive, and report.”"
0,"“I thought about it, I did."
0,But I don’t think I could have attacked her and won.
0,"That final woman with them, I thought she was an oread at first by her appearance, but she wasn’t."
0,She was a strong fire mage.
0,Strongest I’ve ever seen.
0,Her power could best any minum in our army.”
0,This news was troubling.
0,"Locating the wife they had searched desperately for was wonderful news, but the attack on his men and the aid of two humans, one of whom was a talented fire mage, was ominous."
0,"“Lieutenant, how many talented human women do you know among our fire mages, either deceased, missing, or in active duty?”"
0,The lieutenant folded his arms and thought.
0,"After a long period of silence, he shook his head."
0,"“None, sir."
0,Women in the army are few outside medics.
0,"I am sure that if such a talented woman existed, she would have been well known among the men, or more likely wed before ever entering the army."
0,"To my knowledge, there are no active fire mages who are women.”"
0,The only women conscripted into the army were those who were found unable to bear children.
0,"They tended to be older than most recruits given the time taken to discover their infertility, and they were treated no different than men."
0,"Byurk’s lieutenant was correct in that had such a talented woman existed within Tolmyur, she would be well known."
0,"“I thought the same,” Byurk replied."
0,“However…”
0,There was one.
0,“What can you tell me about her magic?
0,"I assume she attacked you as you fled,” Byurk asked."
0,"“I was running too hard to see clearly, but the explosion from her fire would have taken five or more mages."
0,It landed far behind me but nearly blew the clothes off my back.
0,She did that on her own.”
0,"Very troubling, indeed."
0,“Your assumption that this woman was an oread is troubling.
0,Oreads are earth nymphs.
0,Are you familiar with maenads?” Byurk asked.
0,The scout shook his head.
0,“They are fire nymphs with a volatile temperament.
0,"Nymphs normally cannot use magic, but there was one woman I knew with skill in fire magic as you explained."
0,She was a half-maenad hunter mercenary traveling with Commanding General Jethro and I when we first arrived in Tolmyur.
0,She shared his vision but could not stand the living conditions of our homeland and left not a year later after the Coastal War ended.
0,"But, I find it hard to believe that she would side with Amel.”"
0,“Might I add some possible insight?” the lieutenant asked.
0,"“Speak, lieutenant.”"
0,"“We are in Dhuillir, the home of the dryads."
0,Kissiae can manipulate the minds of others into obedience.
0,"Constant contact is needed to control someone, but a potent enough dose of a kissiae’s poison is enough to make someone believe a certain way or obey a single instruction, more than a kissiae is capable on her own."
0,"These two humans, especially one of such power, could have been manipulated in such a way to see the wife of the emperor as an ally and protect her.”"
0,“But the dryads are on our side.
0,"The kissiae are even working directly with our Commanding General, right?” "
0,The scout’s eyes flitted between Byurk and the Lieutenant.
0,Byurk nodded.
0,“And the Elos marshlands are far from here.”
0,“What if they surrendered so quickly in order to protect themselves from attack but are in truth working to help the fleeing wife?
0,It would be the perfect cover.
0,"None of us have been attacked by the dryads in the past, but now they have attacked our supply routes when the campaign against the fairies is in most need of supplies."
0,"The timing is too perfect to be a coincidence,” the lieutenant said."
0,Worry grew on the scout’s face.
0,Their camp was in the center of a dryad village.
0,"There were soldiers on watch shifts throughout the night, but dryads specialized in stealth and guerrilla warfare."
0,Life magic could kill silently.
0,A tenth or more of the soldiers could be killed in their sleep before anyone noticed.
0,"“Let’s not be rash,” Byurk replied."
0,"“While I cannot rule out that these dryads do not harbor ill feelings towards us, I doubt they would go so far as attacking us.”"
0,"“Sir, with the news from the scout, there is still a risk,” the lieutenant pushed."
0,“Call for the matriarch.
0,We cannot have our fears and assumptions create danger for our convoy where there is none.”
1,The lieutenant left the tent with haste and returned with the village matriarch.
0,Extreme worry showed on her face from the hastened manner the lieutenant brought her.
0,She knelt and bowed forward until her nose rested on the ground.
0,"With a shaking voice, she spoke."
0,“Is something wrong my Lord?”
0,“We have received word of a danger to my soldiers traveling through Melia.
0,The company we sent ahead was attacked.
0,"This man was the only survivor,” Byurk explained."
0,The matriarch’s trembling increased.
0,“I can assure you; my village had nothing to do with any attack on your men.
0,We would not dare harm a human.
0,I can call all our sisters together.
0,"If there are any of us missing, we will help you investigate it thoroughly.”"
0,"The Amelian Empire’s use of human to collectively refer to all those from the Tolmyur Kingdom despite the minums being the ruling class and the minum language being the major political language of the kingdom was a source of irritation to Byurk, a minum, but he understood she meant no insult by it."
0,"The elves, and by extension the empire, had dealings with the humans long before any interaction with minums."
0,That misnomer was simply cultural on their part.
0,"“That will not be needed,” Byurk replied."
0,The matriarch looked up at Byurk with fear and pleading.
0,An investigation would not be necessary if he planned to kill them all here and now.
0,“The ones who attacked were not dryads but a flock of blue hawks.”
0,“The Habha?” 
0,"“What my scout tells me is that these hawks were sent on our men by a High Elf, the missing wife of the emperor we have been searching for.”"
0,“The wife?
0,Was she not in Vallen?”
0,Byurk stared into the matriarch’s eyes.
0,"There was fear and confusion hiding in her deep, viridescent irises, but he did not sense any sign of deceit."
0,Her eyes bore the truth of her belief that the wife was still in Vallen.
0,This village had no foreknowledge that the wife had made it to Melia.
0,The fear in the Matriarch’s eyes quickly grew to terror during Byurk’s fixed stare.
0,She crawled to him and grasped at the skirt of his robe.
0,“Please.
0,I beg you.
0,We Melians have already surrendered to you.
0,We will not resist.
0,My village has not sided with the wife nor will we.
0,Have mercy on our land.”
0,The estate of the wife’s family in Amel was demolished.
0,The village of the wife’s youth was razed.
0,"She took refuge in Vallen, and now only a handful of fairy cities remained in the entire kingdom."
0,"Now that the wife appeared, the matriarch feared that the same as what was happening in Vallen would befall Melia."
0,"“I have no intention of resorting to meaningless slaughter,” Byurk assured."
0,The Matriarch gripped tight the skirt of Byurk’s robe and pressed her forehead into the ground in gratitude.
0,“I do not think the Melians have chosen to willingly shelter the wife.
0,"If the Habha are involved, she may have come from Fiorrae."
0,There are a far greater number of them there.”
0,"Those hawks are the sole reason we have been unable to pressure the sprites to surrender, and normally the sprites do not meddle in affairs outside their territory."
0,"“I feel that it is the sprites who have sided with the wife, and now she is taking action."
0,"She may be in your lands, but I do not wish for war to break out in Melia."
0,My question is why has she chosen now to show herself?
0,"If you know anything, tell me.”"
0,"The matriarch slowly raised her head, but her eyes did not meet Byurk’s, only staring at his chest."
0,"Her mouth opened and closed, opened and closed again."
0,"After licking her dry lips, she spoke."
0,“One who walks is among us.
0,That may be her reason.”
0,“One who walks?
0,What do you mean?”
0,The matriarch hesitated.
0,“This knowledge concerns the wellbeing of your people.
0,Telling me is in Melia’s best interest.”
0,"The matriarch’s head lowered apologetically, so Byurk assumed that she would remain silent, but to his surprise, she complied."
0,"“When a dryad lives to a great age, she grows roots."
0,"Without her consent, they cling to the ground with each step to root her.”"
0,“Hamadryads…” Byurk now understood her apologetic form.
0,Tolmyur had assassinated the three hamadryads at the beginning of the war.
0,Her apology was directed at the new hamadryad whose life could be threatened by this information.
0,“Yes.
0,"When a dryad reaches the age of roots, she begins a pilgrimage to each of the dryad tribes and remains in those lands until she earns those tribes’ support as their Grandmatriarch.”"
0,Anxiety gripped Byurk’s chest.
0,“Do you know how many tribes have given her their support?”
0,"“She was born among the cedars, so we are seventh in order."
0,"She is in Melia, so we can assume six tribes have accepted her as Grandmatriarch.”"
0,"“If Melia accepts her, she would have the support of nearly half of the tribes.” Byurk scratched the strip of grey hair along the side of his head in consternation."
0,Tolmyur was ignorant of Dhuillir’s politics and the new hamadryad.
0,"This was the same as their ignorance about Ceil, the emperor’s secret wife."
0,Ceil’s appearance could have no other reason than her desire to meet with the new hamadryad now that the hamadryad reached the tribe closest to where she was hiding in Fiorrae.
0,"If she persuades the hamadryad to side with her, those tribes who accepted the hamadryad would side with her also."
0,"Should the hamadryad complete her pilgrimage and become Grandmatriarch, all of Dhuillir would side with the wife."
0,"Without Jethro, Tolmyur could not fight two fronts against both Vallen and Dryads."
0,"Or perhaps they could if they finished the campaign in Vallen quickly, but the losses on their side would be severe, and that could destabilize their position in the former Amelian Empire."
0,The presence of both Ceil and the hamadryad in Melia was an imminent threat.
0,"“We could kill the hamadryad,” Byurk spoke under his breath, and the matriarch shrunk beneath him as if she knew this would be the decided conclusion."
0,He looked at her meek frame and thought again on the generosity the Melians had shown.
0,Most the dryads disliked warfare and were one of the first nations to surrender to Tolmyur to avoid further conflict.
0,"Siding with the wife would bring war on a level equal to the destruction of the fairies, a terribly foolish decision."
0,"If he could convince the hamadryad to continue their submission to Tolmyur, not only could the hamadryad unify the dryads in the truce, but she could also use the dryads to better aid the capture of the wife."
0,Byurk gently grasped the wrist of the matriarch and raised her to her knees.
0,"“No, I do not desire the death of your hamadryad."
0,"If her desire is to keep Melia and all Dhuillir safe, we will need her help."
0,"Inform all surrounding villages that our target, Ceil, the widow of the former Emperor, has arrived in their lands."
0,"If she comes to their village, capture her and send word to me, our forces in Vallen, and the Amelian Palace."
0,"Warn them that if they side with her, they risk bringing Commanding General Jethro’s fury upon them."
0,It will be out of my hands then.
0,"If you know where the hamadryad is, inform her that I seek audience.”"
0,The light of hope glistened in the matriarch’s eyes.
0,“I will send messengers at once!” 
0,She ran from the tent into the night.
0,“Have our plans changed?”
0,"“No, lieutenant."
0,Our men in Vallen need these resources.
0,You will leave tomorrow as scheduled.”
0,"“Me, sir?” "
0,“I will take a party with me and meet with the hamadryad.
0,You will lead the rest of the convoy in my place.”
0,The scout bowed his head.
0,"“With permission, I want to bring message to Amel about the wife’s sighting.”"
0,“Perfect. Do so.
0,"Should Jethro return from his campaign, his help in capturing her and convincing the hamadryad will be invaluable."
0,Get some rest and depart in the morning.”
0,“Sir.” The scout and lieutenant left the tent.
1,Byurk unfolded the fur he sat on and laid down on it.
0,"He thought he would be elated that the widow had been located, if that was truly Ceil, but no part of this sat right with him."
0,Why was she working with humans?
0,"Why would the small nation of sprites, no larger than pixies and thought to only have a population of a few hundred, ally with her?"
0,"Most concerning of all, how would the Melians and the hamadryad react to her appearance?"
0,What if she requested or even demanded their aid?
0,"By right, Ceil was the Empress of the Amelian Empire because the first princess had yet to take up the throne."
0,There may be many among the Melians who still support the former dynasty or will obey due to a sense of obligation.
0,The Melians do not deserve to be pulled into this war.
0,Byurk blew out his lantern and hoped with all his heart that Jethro would return promptly from the other world to aid in a quick capture of the widow before anything happened to Melia.
0,"Chapter 9
“A Frog in a Well”
Jethro"
0,"“Both you and Eydis FeAmel have a much greater role to play than revenge, so I am compelled to restrain your hand."
0,I ask that you discontinue your plans to invade this world.”
0,Jethro walked down the crowded streets of an unfamiliar city with his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket.
0,The clothing of this world was far more comfortable than the crude material found in Tolmyur.
0,"His robe was far too conspicuous, and without this country’s currency, Jethro was forced to make use of his spatial magic to steal clothing."
0,"He grew a short goatee, the only style of facial hair that was not shown on the bottom of the facial composite the doppelganger created."
0,"Without this level of caution, he would not have been able to travel unnoticed."
0,"Again, he found himself stuck in a foreign world, except this time he entered it in open hostility, not out of scientific curiosity."
0,"He took precautions and made preparations to be able to return to Whinhlem, but those preparations were undone by a single woman no larger than his hand, but this was only temporary."
0,"The pulse she sent through his body before departing restrained his magic, specifically his inter-world transmission and teleportation spells."
0,He spent every available hour the first few weeks investigating the foreign ven in his body.
0,"He thought at first that she had cast some form of life magic because she used it by touch, but over time he realized that it was spatial magic of an unfathomable complexity, perhaps combined with life magic for the application."
0,It was a barrier implemented such that it blocked any spatial ven of the specific signature created by his inter-world formulas and nothing else.
0,"He could travel this world visiting the major cities to learn of the peoples and cultures, but the moment he tried to teleport back to Whinhlem, the flow of ven in his body seized up."
0,Every attempt to determine the makeup or encryption of the magic ended in failure.
0,"It was far too complex for him to understand, and he doubted he would be able to decipher it in his lifetime."
0,The only positive outcome of his investigation was that the magic skillfully placed in his body had a time limit.
0,"The woman who cast it had made no attempt to hide this, almost as if he was a scolded child sat in a chair and then told by his parent that when the clock hands were both vertical he could leave, and this frustrated him to no end."
0,At least he knew the identity of what did this to him.
0,It was a sprite.
0,Jethro was surprised by the number of sprites on Whinhlem.
0,"To his knowledge, there were only two on his home world, Trattnou, and they were both well known."
0,They worked directly under Lord Tentopreklefit and only for observational purposes.
0,"The sprites on Whinhlem were not only far larger in number, but they also had the freedom to organize and form their own society."
0,"Now on Earth, there was a sprite who directly hindered his plans."
0,"The sprites on Trattnou never used magic, so Jethro had no idea if the power of the sprite on Earth was normal."
0,"He could have accepted failure if it was due to his own underestimation of the capabilities of the people of Earth, but to fail because of the interference of a third party with power far surpassing his own made his skin crawl."
0,The outcome was out of his hands from the beginning.
0,"From what that sprite said, she planned to interfere in his capture of the princess from the start."
0,She likely knew everything about what was happening on Earth just like the two in his world did about everything on Trattnou.
0,"If she was going to actively prevent Jethro from interfering in this world, his only real choice was to wait until her magic wore off."
0,Jethro picked up an English newspaper from the stand he passed and tossed the vendor a few coins.
0,He fled the continent he invaded for a small island country on the other side of the planet that also spoke English but with a heavy accent.
0,Or it could be more correctly stated that this country spoke the correct dialect of English because the language bore this country’s name.
0,"Politics, trade, war, colonialization, or a combination of many different factors had spread the language throughout the world to lands far larger than the country of origin, but this world was still too primitive to have a unified language, and that limited where he could stay comfortably while waiting."
0,"At least without a global society, his facial composite would not travel as fast, if at all, outside the country he invaded, but because there was a risk, he bought a local paper every few days."
0,"His invasion made international news as did the princess’s press conference, but his face had yet to appear in the news in England, at least to his knowledge with the limited resources at his disposal."
0,A small drop of rain ruined Jethro’s plan to find a bench to peruse the paper.
0,He walked the streets until he found a store with a restroom.
1,"Once inside, he opened a portal and stepped through to an abandoned studio, or at least he was sure it was abandoned."
0,"The paved floor had a thin layer of dust, and the room was barren aside from four cement pillars."
0,The windows were high off the ground and had bars on them.
0,The metal double doors had a chain and lock on the outside.
0,There was no way to get inside unless one owned the key or could teleport.
0,"This created the perfect hideaway, but it was often cold."
0,Jethro walked to the corner to some cardboard and a stack of papers.
0,He sat cross-legged on the cardboard and set aside the newspaper.
0,"With a pen in hand, he spread the papers across the ground."
0,They were covered in sigils.
0,"Most were attempts to decipher the spell cast on him by the sprite, but once he gave up on that endeavor, he started a new task."
0,"If the spell prevented him from using his inter-world transmission and teleportation, he needed to develop a new formula."
0,His first few attempts involved minor changes to the original formula to enable it to keep the same functionality.
0,This only worked briefly.
0,"The sprite’s spell did not react immediately, but his ven seized up before the transmission activated."
0,"The reason was likely due to its similarity to the original, but he feared making major changes without Emer’s guidance."
0,Now he was approaching the issue from a different direction.
0,"If he could not send something physical, perhaps he could send a wave or pulse or form of energy via teleportation."
1,"The sun had set below the horizon by the time Jethro felt confident in his design, the cold studio growing almost too dark to see if not for the faint city lights outside the windows."
0,"Because what he was sending was not physical, the formula was surprisingly simple compared to the inter-world teleportation formula that Emer had made by chance."
0,It also required far less ven than the inter-world transmission.
0,"He thought about using transmission as the base instead of regular teleportation, but he would be limited in what kind of signals could be sent over due to the near-instantaneous nature of transmission."
0,"If a code was agreed upon with the receiver beforehand, perhaps it might work, but for now that was impossible."
0,“Let’s see if this works.
0,But who to send it to?”
0,"There was something that weighed on his mind since his invasion failed, and this would make a perfect test of the new magic."
0,"He activated his magic, but there was no physical manifestation like the jagged rift in the air created by a normal portal."
0,There was no light or sound like transmission.
0,“Is it working?”
0,"His ven was not blocked by the sprite’s spell, so he was certain that the magic he cast did or was doing something, and unlike teleportation which used all the ven required for it immediately, this spell slowly drained his ven while active."
0,"“Markus, can you hear me?”."
0,Silence
0,Jethro spoke a bit louder.
0,"“Markus, are you there?”"
0,He then waited again but not for long.
0,A mildly distorted voice came from the air.
0,“Jethro?
0,Where are you?”
0,“Brilliant! It worked!”
0,Jethro shot his fists into the air ecstatic that he was able to show up the sprite that had trapped him on Earth.
0,“What is the meaning of this?
0,I cannot see you.”
0,"“My apologies, Markus."
0,"I am currently in another world, and I cannot make it back for a while.”"
0,“Have you returned to your world?” 
0,Jethro shook his head despite knowing that Markus could not see him.
0,"“No. I am on another world that the Amelian princess fled to, surprisingly.”"
0,“You are not the only one capable of teleporting between worlds?”
0,“It is a complicated story.
0,"Due to troublesome circumstances, my teleportation back to Whinhlem is being blocked.”"
0,“I pray this is temporary.” 
0,"“It is, but I am not completely sure when my probation here will end.” "
0,“What need do you have of me?
0,You would not have contacted me this late otherwise.”
0,Jethro paused to think of the time difference.
0,"Days on Earth were not exactly one half of days on Whinhlem, but close."
0,He was almost on the other side of the planet from the city he invaded.
0,"If he considered that difference and estimated the time lost, but then account for the tilted axis, which meant latitude and change in tilt over time…"
0,Too troublesome.
0,“I have a question.
0,Did an injured man appear in your study about forty or so days ago?
0,He was shot in the stomach with a small projectile.
0,There might have been two women with him.”
0,"“I am not your personal doctor, Jethro."
0,I am the King’s.
0,"If he discovered that I was making house calls, he would execute me, forget that I am the only life mage in Tolmyur.”"
0,“That young man is worth the risk.
0,He is a peculiar time mage.”
0,“A time mage?” 
0,“One that ignores channeling time.” 
0,“Isn’t he simply using time magic to speed it up?” 
0,“That is recursive reasoning.
0,The spell to decrease channeling time would need channeling time to cast.
0,And I forgot to mention he is human.”
0,“A human with a time affinity?
0,Are you trying to make a set?
0,"I’m sorry Jethro, but I don’t think you will find one with an affinity to gravity.”"
0,“That was not my intent.
0,Back to my original question.
0,Were you able to treat him?”
0,“No injured appeared in my study.” 
0,“I figured as much.” 
0,Jethro paced in a circle.
0,The Sprite altered the destination.
0,He might not even be on Whinhlem.
0,"If he was still on Earth, he would have likely returned to the princess by now."
0,"“What is the meaning of all this, Jethro?”"
0,“My teleportation was intercepted mid cast.” 
0,“Is that even possible?” 
0,"“I suppose it is, because it happened."
0,"I will not go into details, but my plan was to show that man what kind of country Tolmyur is."
0,"Given his time affinity, I assumed he would get pulled into the military and rise in rank rather quickly.”"
0,“Following in your footsteps?” 
0,“More allowing him to see what I saw when I first came to Tolmyur and to learn our purpose in attacking the Amelian Empire.
0,"I forgot to mention he is a friend of the princess, and from her screams when he vanished, possibly something more.”"
0,"“By the God’s, Jethro."
0,What are you plotting?”
0,“No plotting.
0,"This was more of a whim, but if he is not there, then nothing can be done."
0,I will let you rest.”
0,“Jethro.” 
0,Jethro was about to end his spell when Markus spoke.
0,"“What is it, Markus?”"
0,"Markus’s voice was hushed, which made it difficult to understand in the distortion."
0,"“I may not be your personal life mage, but I can be."
0,"All you need to do is give me the word, and I will do it on the King’s next examination."
0,You already have the blessing of most the military and the people.
0,We will support you.”
0,“I know…” 
1,Jethro ended the spell.
0,The total ven expenditure from the entire conversation was about the same as a single inter-world transmission.
0,He leaned back and thought about Markus’s parting words.
0,"He knew what the people thought of him and their oppression under the current King, but he had made a promise to work personally with the people."
0,That was not possible sitting on the throne.
0,"Even if he became king, life for the people of Tolmyur would not suddenly improve, even in his lifetime."
0,"The land was mostly inhospitable, and they had no means of escaping it in mass."
0,The Stollmuk Mountains to the west were controlled by the golems.
0,"The golems disliked most humans but were not hostile, and due to their agreement with the Amelian Empire, humans were not allowed to enter their territory."
0,"Even if they could, the mountains were treacherous, and what awaited them on the other side was their eternal enemy, the Amelian Empire."
0,"To the south were the sirens, and to the east were the merfolk."
0,"As powerful seamen as giants were, Tolmyur lacked the technology to construct ships sturdy enough to safely transport large groups through siren or merfolk territory."
0,"Every attempt saw the ships sink before crossing the horizon, especially now that sirens and merfolk could enter their coastal waters."
0,The marshes to the north were controlled by the goblins.
0,"Those who attempted to escape Tolmyur traveled north through the swamps into the wilderlands, and many had been successful, but any attempt at a large exodus ended with a massacre by the goblins."
0,"If Jethro wanted to help the people of Tolmyur, the best option he felt he had was to reverse the events that placed them in their natural and political prison ages ago, and that meant the complete destruction of the Amelian Empire."
0,"Jethro activated his inter-world communication spell, this time targeting the Amelian Palace."
0,"He was unsure where to place the destination, but the one he desired to speak to would be able to sense the spatial ven."
0,"“Emer, can you hear me?”"
0,"After calling out a few more times, he attempted a different location in the palace."
0,"When that failed, he tried another."
0,He then felt embarrassed with himself.
0,There was little point being discreet in Amel like he had been when contacting Markus.
0,He targeted the central courtyard where a few soldiers were always stationed and amplified the output.
0,“This is your commanding general.
0,"If you can hear me, speak.”"
0,He could hear muffled conversations but was unable to make any sense of it.
0,"After a moment of silence, a single voice came from the other end."
0,"“Sir, we cannot see you."
0,May I ask you to report where you are?”
0,The soldiers would obviously be skeptical of a voice from the air.
0,The man speaking was likely an officer who knew about his campaign and was asking for proof or clarification of Jethro’s identity.
0,"Jethro was grateful that his men were not so easily fooled by a voice, even if it was his."
0,“I am currently in the other world.
0,Bring Emer and any other officers on hand.
0,"The mission to capture the princess has failed, and there is much I need to discuss.”"
0,“Sir!” 
0,Jethro could hear muffled footsteps and the clanking of armor.
0,"The officer who replied gave orders to the soldiers in the courtyard, but they became too distorted for Jethro to understand."
0,"While he waited, he began to feel slight restriction of his ven."
0,“I need Emer here now!” 
0,The spell the sprite cast on him was adapting.
0,"It did not activate instantly, but his continued use of inter-world magic triggered it."
0,"Somehow, she programmed into the formula a method for it to actively learn and mutate."
0,“Hurry!”
0,How is this even possible?
0,How did that sprite create a living spell?!
0,Jethro heard a voice that sounded like Emer’s but he could not understand it.
0,“Emer!
0,Read the trace from this spell!
0,Find my location and open a portal!”
0,All Jethro heard was muffled replies.
0,“Get my location from this spell and open a portal to this world!
0,Do you understand me?!”
0,"His ven seized up, and the spell collapsed."
0,"In anger, Jethro tore the papers of sigils and threw the shreds."
0,Jethro cursed his own curiosity over the man who could use time magic.
0,"If he had thought longer about how to test the new spell and who to contact first, what was most important, he could have returned to Whinhlem with Emer’s help."
0,"If he had considered the possibility that the restriction spell would have such a delayed activation, he might have been able to return before it activated."
0,“You surprised me.
0,As expected of The Bridge between Worlds.”
0,A faint feminine voice spoke in Jethro’s head.
0,He would not mistake the voice of the one who trapped him on Earth.
0,"Jethro looked around to find the source of the voice, but the dark cement studio was empty."
0,"“While I commend you for your ingenuity, I feel I must also punish you.”"
0,The small womanly figure appeared in front of his face and placed her hand on his forehead.
0,"Another pulse surged through his body, and Jethro felt the distinct sensation of spatial magic use."
0,The sprite then disappeared before he could react.
0,“I have reset the clock.
0,Take the extra time to think about what you are doing.”
0,Jethro could not protest.
0,What else did he expect?
0,He sat back against the cold cement wall and stared into the dark.
1,"* * *
“Jethro?”"
0,The voice Emer heard from the peculiar spatial magic no longer responded.
0,"According to the soldiers who summoned him, Jethro’s voice was clearer before he arrived."
0,"Although the voice was Jethro’s, Emer could not understand it."
0,“Could you make out what he was saying?”
0,"Keeya’s voice in his head gave a short reply, “No.”"
0,Emer turned to the human officer who was there when Jethro first made contact.
0,“What did Jethro say before I arrived?”
0,The officer looked at the soldiers around him.
0,"Emer was an elf, and although he was a slave of Jethro’s, they were unsure what they should tell him, if anything at all."
0,"“If Jethro called for me, the information he gave was for my ears as well.”"
0,The three officers discussed quietly.
0,"After coming to an agreement, the initial officer stepped forward."
0,“All we know is that the invasion has failed.”
0,"Like the sun rising in the clear sky on a winter morning, radiant warmth filled Emer’s chest."
0,"The city burned when Emer tested the return spell from the other world, but somehow the princess avoided Jethro."
0,"Such an opportunity to capture her would not come again, at least not as easily."
0,“You have spatial magic.
0,We want you to send messages to inform the commanders.” 
0,Emer looked at the dwarf who was trying to give him orders.
0,“I do not serve you.
0,Send your own messengers.”
0,Angry mumblings rose from the soldiers in the courtyard.
0,The officers looked at Emer with displeasure.
0,Two of them gripped their sheathed swords.
0,One of the soldiers ran to the officer’s side.
0,"“Sir, the Commanding General might be in danger."
0,He was yelling for the elf before you returned.”
0,“You have the ability to go to the other world.
0,"You should ascertain your master’s safety,” the dwarf ordered next."
0,Emer smiled.
0,"“Keeya, did you hear Jethro ask for our help?”"
0,Keeya shook her head.
0,“Did he ever give us an order to save him if he was in trouble?”
0,"“No,” she spoke in a faint voice."
0,"The soldiers shouted in protest, and the faces of the officers grew stern."
0,The human officer drew his sword and stepped towards Emer.
0,“You betray your own master?”
0,“I only do as I am ordered.
0,Whether Jethro is in danger or not makes no difference to me.
0,He can stay and die in that world.”
0,A small tinge of pain pricked the back of Emer’s mind.
0,"“Be careful what say,” Keeya reprimanded."
0,"“Unless Jethro order’s me, I will not act,” Emer asserted."
0,“Know your place!”
0,The blade of the officer slashed crosswise at Emer.
0,"The strike was not to kill, only maim."
0,It deflected a few inches from Emer’s arm with a metallic ring.
0,Such a weak strike could never break a barrier made by the Amelian Empire’s leading spatial magic expert.
0,"Before the officer could recover from the recoil, strands of ivy grew and wrapped around the officer’s sword arm and crept up to his torso."
0,"The officer’s wrist pulled back, and his sword pointed at his chest."
0,The tip of the blade slowly dug into the leather armor and pierced it.
0,The vines did not force his arm; they hung slack.
0,The man used his own strength.
0,He hollered a terrified scream.
0,"The other officers and soldiers rushed to subdue Emer and Keeya, but they were stopped by Emer’s barrier."
0,They all watched as the officer slowly drove the blade through his chest in a terrifying display of kissiae power.
0,Keeya’s long ivy hair unwound from his arm and hung to the ground.
0,She looked around at the soldiers with listless eyes.
0,“No one hurt Emer.
0,Jethro order.”
0,Emer flashed a pleased grin.
0,“To think one of Jethro’s own officers would disobey him.
0,"That is proper punishment for disobedience, is it not?”"
0,"The soldiers watched in shock as Emer opened a portal back to his office and stepped through, pulling Keeya’s long ivy hair after him."

“The Reward for Hard Work”
Sammy"
1,“No. Get away… Leave me alone.
0,Sammy!”
0,Sammy sat up after hearing her name called during her restless sleep.
0,“Get this buzzard away from me!”
0,She rubbed her sleep-drunk eyes until they found focus in the dark.
0,"Beside her, Ceil leaned on her elbow with her other arm pushing at what looked like a headless bird."
0,"His two long, yellow plumes stuck out and forward, looking not altogether unlike large moth antennae."
0,Sammy thought she was dreaming and rubbed her eyes again.
0,It was only then that she realized the large blue hawk’s head was turned around and buried into the feathers on his back.
0,"He was sitting right where, or next to where, Ceil’s head would be should she lay back down."
0,"This was not the first time he had nestled up next to Ceil at night, but over the past few days, Ceil was too distraught to care."
0,Sammy saw Ceil’s current frustration as a sign of progress after Ceil had emotionally shut down when her tails were seen.
0,"“Stop staring and move him,” Ceil demanded."
0,Sammy sighed.
0,She reached over and gently lifted the incredibly light bird.
0,The two moth antennae twisted round and became the long yellow plumes they once were when his head unburied and looked at Sammy quizzically.
0,He snapped his beak twice in protest.
0,“I know.
0,I know.
0,You are only trying to help.” 
0,She sat him down next to Justin’s head so that his feathers would help keep Justin warm.
0,“You don’t need to worry about Ceil.
0,What happened was not your fault.”
0,"“Yes it was,” Ceil protested, pushing herself up to a slanted kneel, leaning on her right arm."
0,“Can you keep it down?” Chloe’s weary voice broke up the conversation.
0,"“Sorry, Chloe,” Sammy apologized."
0,“We will.
0,Go back to sleep.”
0,Chloe turned her back to everyone and shifted closer to Justin to fill the small gap she created.
0,"A few seconds later, deep breaths announced she was fast asleep already."
0,Sammy brushed the breast feathers of the hawk’s belly.
0,“See that?
0,"We are bothering Chloe, so stay here between Justin and me, okay?”"
0,The bird lightly snapped his beak but turned his head to his back once again creating the odd moth antennae.
0,“Sorry Ceil.
0,I didn’t even notice he had moved from here.”
0,Ceil shook her head with and exasperated and slightly sunken expression.
0,"“No, you haven’t been sleeping well."
0,"On top of that, you’ve had to take care of Justin, that buzzard… and me…”"
0,Taking care of the bird was Sammy’s responsibility because both Chloe and Ceil felt she should have left him.
0,"Chloe was, of course, doing her part in helping Justin, but Sammy could not leave him to her alone because she still felt personally responsible for his condition."
0,"In Ceil’s distraught state, she only clung to Sammy, further increasing the load Sammy bore."
0,Sammy could not deny that she felt stretched thin like an elastic band about to snap.
0,"Her neck and right shoulder ached considerably, and her body felt sickly."
0,There was no other way to describe it.
0,The only solace she found was that the added stress was warding away her nightmares about Jethro and the attack on Gullivan.
0,"She had too many other things on her mind to worry about--finding help for Justin, learning enough about Whinhlem to be useful, tending to Coby’s injury so that he could survive on his own, helping Ceil’s emotional distress, the soldiers learning of Ceil’s identity and placing the dryads in danger, something Sammy was directly at fault for--but those constant worries made her feel less rested than the former nightmares."
0,"No matter how much she meditated or tried to think of something else, those worries forced themselves to the front of her mind as if they had a life of their own."
0,Sammy pulled Ceil into a light embrace.
0,“Don’t worry about that.
0,We have to take care of each other when one of us is down.” 
0,"Ceil’s fingers gripped Sammy’s shirt, and her head hung apologetically."
0,“Let’s get to bed.” 
0,"Sammy laid Ceil down, and she clung to Sammy’s arm as she slept."
1,"“That’s all you get,” Sammy barked."
0,“Kree!”
0,“Don’t give me that tone.
0,She needs it more than you.
0,You don’t have a fire affinity.”
0,The large blue bird stood taller than Sammy as she sat down eating her breakfast next to the small fire.
0,He clicked and snapped his beak near Chloe to beg for handouts.
0,"The breakfast included a few strips of dried meat, which Sammy also gave the bird out of her own portion, but Chloe was given extra compared to everyone else."
0,"The species of hawk was omnivorous, so he had already eaten his allotment of herbs and roots."
0,“We should not even be wasting our food on it.
0,"You have a hard enough time taking care of Justin,” Ceil said."
0,"“He’s healing just fine, and once he can fly again, he’ll leave."
0,"Besides, I gathered these this morning.” "
0,Sammy placed her hand on the far side of the bird’s beak and turned its head towards her.
0,He responded by rubbing its beak on the side of her head and nipping at her hair.
0,“This morning?
0,When?!”
0, Ceil looked exasperatedly at Sammy.
0,"“I woke up early and couldn’t go back to sleep, so I decided to do something useful.”"
0,"Sammy knew Ceil wanted to protest, but Ceil remained silent."
0,"Gathering food was normally Ceil’s job, but Ceil was not motivated to do anything, and her expression slowly became one of guilt."
0,"Sammy realized her words could have been understood as a jab at Ceil, but she could not think of a way to correct herself without laying more pressure on Ceil’s emotional state."
0,"Instead, she gave a simple and sincere smile to tell Ceil not to worry."
1,"Being the first to finish her meal, Sammy separated a small distance from the group with the sword in hand dragging on the ground beside her."
0,She had little strength to lift it anymore.
0,She sat down and removed a wrapped eighth of a beiju bulb from the medicine bag at her waist.
0,"Carefully using the blade near the hilt, she chopped the softened root into tiny pieces atop her thigh."
0,"Once small enough, she placed them on a square cloth, wrapped them up, and twisted the corners to seal them in."
0,"With her other hand, she gripped the small bubble of fabric to crush the root."
0,"Her grip was weak, so a lot of effort was needed, making beads of sweat run down her forehead into her eyebrows in the cold morning air."
0,"When one forearm tired, she switched to the other ignoring the juice that leaked through the fabric into her lap until the root on the inside had the consistency of mashed potatoes."
0,Her arms shook when finished.
0,She then returned to the group and placed the wad of fabric close enough to the fire to heat and steam but not catch fire.
0,"When the juices bubbled through the fabric, she retrieved it, rinsed the dirt off with water magic, and approached the bird."
0,“Come here.”
0,The bird jumped back and flapped its free wing.
0,"The wind kicked up dirt and extinguished the small fire, causing no small complaints from Chloe and Ceil, and it almost knocked Sammy off her weak legs."
0,“Oh no you don’t.”
0,"Sammy sprung forward and grabbed the free wing, and in a repeat of his first treatment to remove the arrow, she straddled him."
0,“Kree!”
0,“Can it.
0,This is for your own good.” 
0,Sammy spread the feathers on his shoulders for a better view of the arrow wound.
0,“See?
0,It’s sealing up nicely.” 
0,She pressed the poultice on the wound and held it there as the bird’s large round eyes pleaded with her like she had betrayed him.
0,"His melodramatic performance repeated itself every morning, alternating every other day between applying medicine on the entry or exit wound, so Sammy was not swayed."
0,Sammy’s arms quivered as she held down the bird as large as her and tried to hide her heavy breathing.
0,Beads of sweat dripped from her nose onto the bird’s beak.
0,"Sammy’s eyes lost focus momentarily, and her head nodded forward."
0,"When Sammy recovered and shook off her sickly exhaustion, his eyes lost their drama, only staring blankly at her."
0,They sat motionless until the moisture of the poultice seeped into the wound.
0,She tried to stand but staggered forward.
0,The bird swung its wing to create a gust of wind just strong enough to push her upright.
0,He then righted himself and clicked his beak twice.
0,"“Thanks,” Sammy said with an exhausted grin, and she rubbed the feathers just above his beak."
0,“You can go back to pestering Ceil now.”
0,"“He can what?” Ceil called from beside the fire Chloe re-stoked, having missed the entire treatment."
0,"Without turning to face Ceil, Sammy shook her head."
0,"“You may deny it, but his constant attention has actually helped you recover.” "
0,"Ceil did not reply, and Sammy could not see her reaction, but she was sure Ceil understood she was correct."
0,The clicking of a beak and Ceil’s low grumbling told Sammy all she needed to know.
0,Sammy rinsed the cloth thoroughly with water magic and used it to wipe the sweat off her face.
0,"She then rinsed it again, rung it out, and returned it to the medicine pouch."
1,"Lacking the energy to retrieve the sword, she returned to the fire to sit between Chloe and Justin and began running her fingers through his hair."
0,"“Sammy, you keep calling the bird he or him,” Chloe said as soon as Sammy was settled."
0,“Have you considered naming him?”
0,"“Do not name him,” Ceil protested while trying to keep the bird from nipping at her right ear."
0,“What’s the harm?
0,"I think that’s a great idea,” Sammy said with a weak smile."
0,“But what kind of name?” 
0,Chloe sat with a pensive face and her arms crossed in thought.
0,"“With all the writing I do, I have to come up with a lot of names, and deciding on a good one is one of the hardest parts of creating a good character.”"
0,"“My family is terrible at naming,” Sammy said."
0,“I am named after my grandmothers.
0,"My first name from my mom’s side, my middle name from my dad’s.”"
0,“Did you have any pets?” Chloe asked.
0,"“A budgie, but that’s it."
0,"It’s a small bird,” Sammy explained for Ceil, showing the approximate size by spreading her thumb and forefinger."
0,“What was his name?”
0,“We were going to name him Budge.” 
0,"Chloe breathed and exasperated sigh, and Sammy chuckled."
0,“See?
0,We were bad at coming up with names.
0,But we didn’t name him Budge.
0,"While I think it would have been cute now, as a kid, I thought it was an ugly name."
0,We named him Watchet.”
0,Chloe raised her head and looked at Sammy for an explanation.
0,“It’s a light blue color that matched his feathers.
0,No more imagination needed than knowing obscure colors… wait…”
0,Both Ceil and Chloe stared at Sammy until she shouted her epiphany.
0,“Coby!
0,His feathers are cobalt!
0,We’ll call him Coby!” 
0,Sammy pointed at Coby and repeated his name.
0,“Coby!”
0,Coby cocked his head to the side in confusion and then mildly nipped at the tip of Ceil’s long ear without looking away from Sammy.
0,“Stop that!” Ceil pushed Coby’s beak away and sighed.
0,"“Sammy, is it common for human names to end like that?”"
0,“What do you mean?” 
0,“Your name is Sammy.
0,Then you have Chloe.
0,You named this thing Coby.
0,They all end in the same sound.”
0,"“Oh, not really."
0,"I guess it is common for shortening names, like Thomas goes to Tommy."
0,"My real name is Samantha, but I shorten it to Sammy.”"
0,“Coby is short for Cobalt?” 
0,Chloe laughed.
0,“No.
0,Cobalt is not a normal name.
0,"Coby is an actual name, and like mine, it’s not short for anything."
0,"Coby is just Coby, and I am Chloe."
0,Not all names shorten like that.
0,Justin doesn’t become Justy.”
0,Sammy chuckled.
0,“But Dustin does become Dusty!”
0,Chloe echoed Sammy’s chuckle.
0,“Don’t confuse her.
0,What we are saying is that it depends on the name.”
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“Human culture is odd.
0,Why change the name you are given?
0,Elves would never consider doing so.
0,"Each name has a meaning and blessing given by one’s parents, and changing that would be an insult to them.”"
0,“Some people change their names to be truer to who they are.
0,"For me, my parents are the ones who started calling me Sammy from as early as I can remember.”"
0,“Then I guess that is excusable.” 
0,"“What does Ceil mean,” Chloe asked."
0,"Ceil grew silent, then hesitant."
0,"“You don’t need to tell us if you don’t want to,” Sammy assured her."
0,“No.
0,It is only a little embarrassing.
0,Most names are given with high expectations for the child’s future.
0,Mine is the opposite.
0,"I was born with two tails, something extremely rare, so my mother named me Ceil.”"
0,“Does it have something to do with tails?”
0,Ceil shook her head.
0,“It means grain.
0,Ceil is an ear of grain.”
0,"Sammy did not understand the connection, but she could at least tell that there was little grand about grain."
0,“A woman with a strong name attracts a lot of attention.
0,"My best friend from my hometown was named Linoa, which means strength or prowess."
0,She was very strong for her age.
0,She was a little older than me.
0,"When palace guards came to rip me from my home, she was able to fend off one of the guards on her own until three pinned her to the ground."
0,"Names come with blessings, and those blessings grow to fruition as the child grows.” "
0,Ceil briefly fell silent into a memory.
0,“Linoa is an unusual name for a girl.
0,Most families give names like Eydis.
0,"Eydis means empowerment through wisdom, fitting for the future Empress."
0,It is a name that begs attention.
0,I would already attract a lot of attention once others learned of my two tails.
0,Ceil is a homely name.
0,"My mother’s hope for me was that I would live a modest life in our small farming village, but then my father sold me to the emperor against my mother’s wishes, and now here I am, empress of a fallen empire, widow of the late emperor, and causing the deaths of countless innocent people just by existing.” "
0,"Ceil stood and ripped her staff out of the ground, tearing the small roots that bound it."
0,“Time to depart.
0,We need to find a village quickly.”
0,Regret gripped at Sammy’s heart.
0,This was supposed to have been a lighthearted conversation.
0,"Instead, they accidently stepped on a landmine they never knew existed, but setting off that landmine gave Ceil the volition to move instead of requiring Sammy to drag her along, although she knew that kind of motivation would do more harm than help to Ceil’s mental health."
0,"Regardless of her feelings on the matter and her own desire to rest a little longer, Sammy wanted to take advantage of Ceil’s heightened willpower."
1,She walked over to the sword she left on the ground and placed it in her belt with a shaking arm.
0,"When Chloe finished prepping to leave, they both took an end of Justin’s stretcher."
0,"When Sammy reached down to grab it, Coby nipped at her hand."
0,“Hey!”
0,"When she tried to grab it again, Coby nipped her once more, this time harder, drawing a little blood on the back of her hand."
0,“Stop that!
0,We need to leave!
0,Don’t make me tie that beak of yours.”
0,Coby blew Sammy to her back with a weak gust of wind from his free wing.
0,“Kree!” He bounced lightly between her and the stretcher.
0,"“He doesn’t want you carrying it,” Chloe explained."
0,“Are you feeling okay?”
0,Sammy’s hands grew weak fists.
0,"Even she felt that she would be unable to carry Justin for long, but Ceil was in no condition to carry him, and she didn’t want to force Chloe to drag him again."
0,"That was unfair to her, and the constant agitation did not help Justin’s condition."
0,"“I’m fine,” Sammy lied."
0,"“I will carry him,” Ceil said, moving to the head of the stretcher, much to Sammy’s surprise."
0,“I cannot force you to shoulder all the burden of this journey because of me.” 
0,Ceil placed her hand on Coby’s head and ruffled his feathers lightly.
0,"“I noticed how weak you are, but… I was ignoring it and letting you coddle me."
0,Sorry.”
0,"As if proving Chloe’s assumption, Coby gave a happy trill and hopped aside so Ceil could grab the stretcher."
0,Ceil glared down at Coby.
0,“I hope you realize that some of Sammy’s exhaustion is because of you.”
0,Coby ignored Ceil’s censure and stared away from the group.
0,“Kree!”
0,Everyone looked in the direction Coby was staring.
0,Standing next to a tree a few yards back from the clearing just off the other side of the road was a naked girl with ashen-green skin.
0,"Her clumped, moss-like hair ran down her chest and back like long dreadlocks and obscured much of her face."
0,"She could have been no older that sixteen if she was Human, but what struck Sammy as odd was that she appeared as if she wore a skintight body suit or body paint."
0,"The girl had no nipples despite having breasts, and she had no belly button."
0,It was mildly unsettling.
0,“Is that…”
0,"“A dryad,” Ceil finished for Sammy."
0,She hastily sat down Justin’s stretcher and broke into a sprint.
0,"The dryad panicked and was about to flee, but Ceil shouted something in Elven that froze the girl in place."
0,Sammy watched with bated breath as Ceil caught up and conversed with her.
0,"Their conversation was brief, but she meekly followed Ceil back to them."
0,"There was only one question on Sammy’s mind, and she shouted it even before Ceil and the dryad reached them."
0,“Can she heal Justin?!
0,Can she help him?!”
0," Her body shook, but not from exhaustion."
0,"She fell to her knees and pleaded with every part of her being for this girl to help Justin, but Ceil shook her head."
0,Sammy couldn’t breathe.
0,She felt betrayed.
0,"She held out all hope that when she met a dryad, Justin would receive the help that he so desperately needed."
0,"“Why not?” Sammy cried, struggling to hold back her tears."
0,Ceil did not reply until she reached the group.
0,“Just because someone has a high aptitude for life magic does not mean she can use it skillfully.” 
0,She placed her hand on the shoulder of the dryad who was just barely taller than her.
0,“Dryads send their youth out to relay messages to neighboring tribes.
0,This one is only a messenger on her way to a nearby village.
0,We should be able to find a shaman there to help Justin.”
0,Sammy sprung to her feet and grabbed the dryad by her upper arms.
0,“Where is the village?!”
0,The dryad cowered.
0,"Ceil grabbed Sammy by her sleeve and pulled her away, knocking her to the ground with little effort."
0,“She is not going to tell us if you scare her.” 
0,Ceil ignored Sammy and began questioning the dryad in Elven.
0,Sammy could not understand the conversation and only picked out simple words.
0,"The more she listened, the more she caught until she realized that as the conversation progressed, Ceil used simpler and simpler Elven."
0,"This young dryad was not fluent in the language, and Sammy prayed that they could communicate well enough that Ceil could explain their plight."
0,"“She will take us to a village, but that is all she would agree to."
0,It is a day’s walk back the way we came and another half day off the road.”
0,"The building tears fell from Sammy’s eyes, and she thanked the young dryad in Elven."
0,"The dryad was unsure how to respond, but Ceil pulled her away and asked her to lead after picking up the front of the stretcher."
0,Justin would receive help.
0,All Sammy’s efforts to keep him alive after he nearly died saving her life would bear fruit.
0,That budding hope was the only thought on her mind.
0,"Sammy watched as Ceil, Chloe, and the dryad walked onward not even realizing that she was being left behind."
0,"A strong gust of wind from behind lifted Sammy to her weak legs, and Coby nipped at her left butt cheek to force her to hurry and catch up."
0,"That night, she held fast to Justin, unable to sleep due to her anticipation."
1,"* * *
“She says we are almost there,” Ceil translated for the Melian girl."
0,Ceil stood at the head of Justin’s stretcher once again after refusing to let Sammy carry it.
0,"Sammy protested, because in her pride she felt that carrying Justin to those who would heal him was her responsibility, but when Ceil chastised her and told her that she would only slow them down, she consented."
0,"She followed at Justin’s side, holding his hand the entire way."
0,The dense forest grew sparse.
0,Sammy soon saw one dryad and then another peering at them with curious gazes among the trees and shrubs.
0,They looked similar to the young dryad messenger except for a slightly grayer tint to their skin.
0,"They were adults, so the young dryad’s skin color might change with age."
0,Her assumptions proved correct when she saw more and more dryads.
1,"The trees cleared, and an entire community opened before them, like a gathering in a small field in the forest."
0,"Dryads of many different ages stopped their conversations, weaving, meals, or play and stared at the unknown visitors."
0,"The older dryads indeed had darker skin, more of a grayish-brown, with the younger appearing greener."
0,In the arms of an elderly Dryad was held an infant with cream colored skin like the wood beneath the bark of a young branch.
0,"With her bald head, she looked almost human except for her tiny, pointed ears."
0,The messenger girl ran through the crowd and out of sight.
0,Ceil lowered the stretcher.
0,“I will find a shaman.
0,We will have them provide treatment before I tell them who I am and what happened.
0,I do not want that affecting what help they might provide.”
0,Sammy hugged Ceil.
0,“Thank you.”
0,Ceil’s gaze lowered in a guilty slant.
0,She shook her head.
0,“Sorry this took so long.
0,I will make certain he recovers.” 
0,"After promising Sammy the best, Ceil jogged ahead to converse with the awaiting villagers."
0,Two dryads quickly ran further into the clearing.
0,"After a few minutes of waiting, an elderly dryad with a contrastingly young-looking face and complexion approached them."
0,She spoke to Ceil in fluent Elven.
0,Sammy couldn’t contain her excitement.
0,"Her body quivered uncontrollably, and her stomach contracted painfully."
0,“Is she a shaman?
0,Can she help Justin?” 
0,"Instead of the panicked voice that scared the messenger, Sammy fought within her to remain calm and speak politely."
0,Ceil presented the dryad before Sammy.
0,“This is Tyree.
0,She is the village shaman and one of the best shamans in Melia.
0,She has promised to take care of him.”
0,Tears fell from Sammy’s eyes.
0,She cried her gratitude in Elven repeatedly and could not even collect herself well enough to understand the shaman’s reply.
0,Tyree called over two dryads to lift the stretcher and follow her through the clearing.
0,Ceil then nudged Coby with her foot to follow.
0,The villagers kept a fearful distance from him as he passed.
0,"After hearing Ceil vouch for the ability of the shaman, Sammy knew that Justin would be alright, but doubts slowly grew and her anxiety with them."
0,“Can she really help him?
0,Will Justin be okay?”
0,"She had clung to such thin hope for so long that even when faced with what she had prayed for so desperately, her mind would not believe it, like her hope was fake, a mirage in the desert."
1,She knelt immobile with Chloe at her side and waited while Ceil chatted idly with the villagers.
0,"Ceil was then called away by the shaman, and Sammy’s anxiety grew worse."
0,She could not stop her body from shaking.
0,"The more her anxiety grew, the more her body ached and the more her neck and shoulder burned."
0,Chloe wrapped her arm around Sammy’s shoulder and grabbed her hand.
0,“Everything’s going to be fine.”
0,"At some point, a dryad child placed a small wreath of colorful braided herbs on Sammy’s head, but the kind gesture went completely unnoticed by her, including Chloe’s expression of gratitude on Sammy’s behalf."
0,Sammy only stared in the direction the shaman took Justin.
1,"After what felt like an eternity, Ceil returned with a perplexed expression."
0,She knelt in front of Sammy and grabbed the other hand that Chloe was not holding.
0,“Tyree is treating Justin.
0,She spent a long time investigating his body because it was different than what she knew.”
0,Ceil’s words were not what Sammy wanted to hear.
0,"She wanted Ceil to tell her that Justin was fine now, that he would be okay, that he would wake up and smile sarcastically at her and say, “You look terrible.”"
0,"“She wanted to know what happened to him, so I told her what you told me."
0,"The bad blood, it infested his whole body."
0,She was amazed he was still alive.
0,He should have died long ago.
0,"I told her we were giving him beiju to help with the bad blood, but she said that was like trying to clean a poisoned well with a single pinch of salt.”"
0,Sammy wanted Ceil to tell her straight.
0,"She could not bear the painful details that bore deep gouges into her heart, but she also could not muster the will to tell Ceil to skip them because deep down, she wanted to know everything."
0,“Most of his organs had shut down or were in a hibernating state.
0,All that was active was what he needed to stay alive… The piece of metal you said was still inside him was missing.
0,"Tyree explained that even though he should have died, there was something at work that she could not explain keeping him alive."
0,I think the sprites did something to help him so he could survive the journey until he received treatment.
0,He will recover.
0,Tyree assured me that she could heal him.”
0,Sammy looked into Ceil’s reassuring eyes.
0,The dark clouds in her heart cleared one by one until warmth filled her bosom.
0,"Small rapid breaths escaped her lips, and they grew into a faint laugh or a cry or somewhere in-between."
0,Justin would be okay.
0,He would recover.
0,I did it.
0,“Sammy!
0,Isn’t that great?!”
0, Chloe’s voice sounded distant.
0,“Sammy?”
0,"Sammy’s arms and legs grew numb, and her laughter ceased."
0,She couldn’t breathe.
0,A stinging pain attacked her heart.
0,"A black film spread from the edge of her vision until it met at the center, and her world grew dark."
0,“Sammy!”
0,Her limp body collapsed in Ceil and Chloe’s arms.

“A Promised Warning Fulfilled”
Ceil"
1,Ceil stood in a bed of thick clover looking down at Sammy’s flushed face.
0,"She wanted to be frustrated with her, to reprimand Sammy for overworking and especially for not telling her how weak she had grown, but she couldn’t."
0,Any anger she tried to rouse drowned in her own guilt.
0,Her own depression forced Sammy to carry her at a time when Sammy was already close to breaking.
0,"She promised the Sprite Arkhon that she was fine, but the moment the very real threat of her tails being revealed became reality, she regressed."
0,"The fear and depression was swift, and where she thought she would be able to overcome it, it grabbed her in a vice and pulled her into the murky waters."
0,She knew she was partly to blame for Sammy’s condition.
0,"She saw the signs of Sammy’s exhaustion as she had before--they were worse than before--but she ignored them, wallowing in her own grief."
0,"She sat beside Sammy and grabbed her free hand, the one that was not wrapped around Justin’s arm beside her."
0,She lifted it and pressed the back of the hand against her forehead.
0,"“Sorry, and thank you.”"
0,“That would be better said when she is awake.” 
0,"Tyree walked up behind Ceil carrying the chilled cap of a dark brown mushroom and placed it around the top of Sammy’s head like a bizarre, slimy hat."
0,"Ceil found it odd that Tyree did not use life magic to bring down Sammy’s fever, but Tyree explained that fevers often have a purpose, and that Sammy would be healthier letting it run its course."
0,The mushroom was only to help regulate the temperature.
0,"“The less life magic that is used, the stronger the body will be after it recovers,” Tyree added to her previous explanation."
0,“Relying too heavily on external healing breeds reliance on it.
0,The boy’s situation was different.
0,His body was far beyond his ability to recover.”
0,Ceil placed Sammy’s hand back over her stomach and it intuitively grabbed Justin’s arm that was clasped nearby.
0,"“However,” Tyree continued, “she had an illness besides, something dark and twisted.”"
0,"Ceil’s heart shrunk in her chest, and her eyes found the black mark on Sammy’s neck, now as large as a closed fist."
0,"“Yes, that mark,” Tyree confirmed."
0,“How did she receive it?”
0,"“I do not know,” Ceil lied, fearing to tell the truth, that she was the cause."
0,"Dryads were beings closely connected to life, and Ceil’s magic twisted life into something unnatural."
0,“She had it since before we met in Fiorrae.”
0,“Fiorrae?” Tyree sat in thought.
0,“I know of no disease like this or poison from any creature that causes such a mark.
0,"The mark remains, but I have cured the ill it has done to her."
0,"Unless the mark is removed, the damage will return."
0,"When she wakes, I will ask if she would like me to carve away the mark and replace it with healthy flesh, but the mark goes deep.”"
0,“When will she wake?” 
0,“When her body is rested.
0,Waking her now will help her little.”
0,Tyree hopped next to Ceil and knelt with her legs slightly out to the side.
0,"Despite her age, her body was rather limber, and Ceil did not doubt that she would live for another hundred years or more, possibly even becoming a hamadryad."
0,“I cannot help but be confused by the both of them.”
0,Ceil glanced over at Tyree’s perplexed expression.
0,“What do you mean?
0,More than their injuries or Sammy’s mark?”
0,"“I have only healed a few humans in my lifetime, and very recently at that as they pass through Melia for Vallen, so I cannot speak with any real confidence that the case of these two is not normal for some humans."
0,"I have treated countless elves or fairies or other elfkind, so that is what I am accustomed to."
0,"The sick or injured human soldiers I have treated were all similar, especially to you elves, but these two are different."
0,I am not sure I could call them human.”
0,“They are not human?” 
0,Tyree’s words came as a shock to Ceil.
0,They looked human.
0,Sammy called herself human.
0,"Even the Sprite Arkhon said they were human, and she doubted he would be mistaken."
0,"Then again, the sprites might not have the ability to view the minute details of the body like a dryad shaman could."
0,“Why do you claim they are not human?”
0,"“Their internal structure is the same as other humans and elves, but at the same time it is very different."
0,"Their tissue, muscles, and bones are far more dense and yet far weaker."
0,"They are frail, and I am surprised that they can function normally."
0,"Their bodies would be under constant strain from their own weight, and I worry how long they will last."
0,I am surprised they lived to adulthood.
0,Where are they from?”
0,“I am not sure.
0,"They never told me, but I do not think it was Tolmyur."
0,"Jethro attacked their home, and he would never attack a city in the Tolmyur Kingdom."
0,"Maybe they are from a different continent, somewhere their weight would not be a problem, like the floating isles.”"
0,"If Eydis was sent to another continent, that would explain why Jethro was having such a hard time finding her."
0,“Gebenmoft?
0,"Possibly, but the beastkin are hostile to anyone from our continent and the harpies particularly so."
0,I doubt they would tolerate a human settlement.”
0,“Could they be Lurr?” 
0,Tyree shook her head.
0,“No. Of that I am certain.”
0,Ceil breathed a sigh of relief.
0,"Living on the edge of the Amelian Empire, Lurr were a constant threat to her small village, or so the children were taught, building both caution and fear of their ilk, but in the year and a half she lived in Heivleil, not once had a Lurr ever approached their lands, which was odd considering how common the villagers claimed Lurr attacks were in the past."
0,“They could simply be human but with a defect of birth common to where they are from.” 
0,Tyree placed her hand on Ceil’s shoulder.
0,Ceil felt a faint pulse run through her body.
0,"Tyree’s countenance fell slightly, but then she quickly smiled."
0,"“I can at least say that you are an elf like any other, mostly High Elf.”"
0,“Mostly?”
0,"Tyree replied only with a smile and left to visit their village’s other guest, Chloe, who was currently wrestling with the village children much to the confused looks of the adults."
0,Ceil wanted to join in.
0,She had not wrestled since she was a young girl in her home village.
0,The palace would not tolerate such rambunctious play.
0,"However, as an adult her tails were longer and would easily be revealed with too much motion."
0,"She still planned on telling the village who she was and what had happened, but now that Sammy was also in the village’s care, she had to take extra precaution to gauge how they would react before explaining anything."
0,"A chilled wind blew across Ceil’s back, so even though Sammy had a high fever, she pulled the leaf-woven blanket back over her to keep her warm."
0,"With a parting apology that Sammy could not hear, Ceil left to walk around the village."
1,"Ceil’s hometown was small, or at least she felt it was small only having Amel and the Gallanvale for comparison, but this dryad village made her hometown look like a thriving city."
0,"Her town only had about two hundred residents, but this village could barely be said to reach a hundred, and in stark contrast to her hometown, this village lacked any structures."
0,"A few trees dotted the open field, and it made Ceil wonder how or where the dryads slept."
0,Structures were not as important for dryads in the same way clothes were not.
0,The elements were not a problem.
0,"Depending on the type of dryad, they could handle freezing temperatures or extremely hot temperatures, and although they had body heat, it was lower than other races and acceptant of large fluctuations."
0,"Still, this was the first time Ceil had visited a dryad village, so despite her education about the people, the reality felt bizarre."
0,Ceil waved lightly at the dryads who greeted her as she passed.
0,"She could tell who of them were more fluent in Elven by their greeting, whether it felt simply repeated or rehearsed or whether it was casual or natural, and only the older dryads fell into the latter category."
0,She spotted an anthousai with her mossy hair in full bloom with so many tiny white flowers that her hair appeared to sparkle like snow.
0,Beside her sat what appeared to be the eldest dryad in the village holding the youngest newborn.
0,She approached the trio and knelt in front of them.
0,“Is she this girl’s first child?” Ceil asked the elderly dryad.
0,The young anthousai looked at Ceil with surprise but quickly shook her head.
0,"It seemed that despite her age, appearing one year younger than Ceil if the girl was an elf, the girl had made great effort to learn Elven."
0,The elderly dryad laughed.
0,"“No, dear."
0,"This one is mine, born just before winter began.”"
0,"Ceil tried to hold in her surprise, but she could not hide it from the keen eyes of the elderly."
0,"“Yes, she came as a surprise to me as well, but so long as I still bloom, I may yet bear children.”"
0,"Ceil looked at the elderly dryad’s hair and found it difficult to locate any of the tiny white flowers common to Melians, but sure enough, the flowers were there."
0,"“Of course you would expect Lemi to be the mother, but she is yet an expectant anthousai.” She then chuckled."
0,"“However, with how full she is in bloom, she will bear a child before long, if she has not already begun rearing a child within her."
0,"As I am the newest mother, she is learning from me how to care for the young.”"
0,“Could you not use life magic to check if… Lemi?” 
0,"Ceil looked over to the anthousai, and the girl nodded with a toothy smile."
0,"“I am Lemi,” the girl announced excitedly."
0,“Could you use life magic to check if Lemi is pregnant?”
0,The elderly dryad grinned as if expecting the question.
0,"“We could, easily, but for an anthousai, we leave it to the will and surprise of nature."
0,Part of the enjoyment of an anthousai becoming a mother for the first time is not knowing when the joyful day will come.
0,"After she has her first birth and her flowers start to wilt, when she is no longer an anthousai, we watch pregnancy more closely.”"
0,"The infant began to fuss, so her elderly mother placed her pointer finger in the child’s mouth."
0,She began sucking on it and calmed down.
0,"“I would have thought one of your years would be close to becoming a hamadryad,” Ceil said."
0,“That is not my calling.
0,"You see, not all dryads age the same."
0,"Our shaman, Tyree, and I, we are both the same age, but from birth our callings were different."
0,"I have born many children in my years, enough to create two villages, but Tyree has only two daughters."
0,"The few like her may become hamadryads, but the many like me who are called to motherhood give of our lives to our children and seldom live long enough to take root.”"
0,Ceil recalled that the three hamadryads were assassinated by the humans.
0,"With how youthful Tyree appeared, perhaps there was hope for another hamadryad to appear."
0,“Do you think Tyree will become a Hamadryad?”
0,"“She could, but compared to a hamadryad, Tyree is no more than a child."
0,A lot can happen before she ages enough to root.
0,"Even for those like Tyree, few live that long, and even fewer survive the pilgrimage.”"
0,"The infant finally opened its eyes and noticed that a stranger was present, but much to Ceil’s amazement, the child did not scare."
0,She lifted her arms as if asking to be held.
0,"The elderly dryad removed her finger from the child’s mouth and presented her to Ceil, but Ceil hesitated."
0,“I… I can’t.” 
0,"Ceil felt that her own existence was a terrible omen, and she feared deep in her heart that she would bring misfortune upon such a pure child by even touching her."
0,Sammy lying ill on the other side of the field made that fear ever more real.
0,“You would do me the greatest honor to hold my child and give her your blessing.”
0,“I cannot offer her any blessing.
0,I could only harm her.”
0,“Nonsense.” 
0,The infant was thrust into Ceil’s arms.
0,Her head rested in the cradle of Ceil’s elbow.
0,"She looked up at Ceil with wide, inquisitive eyes having never before seen an elf."
0,"Ceil’s arms shook in fear of such a pure life, but the sensation only caused the infant to smile with a wide, toothless mouth."
0,"“Give her a name,” Lemi exclaimed, bouncing in excitement."
0,"“That is a wonderful idea,” the elderly dryad agreed."
0,Ceil stepped back in shock and then held out the infant for her mother to reclaim her.
0,“I could not possibly.
0,Have you not already named her?”
0,"“Dryad children are often not named until about a full season passes, sometimes two."
0,I feel that is the fate of your arrival.
0,You approached us when we were deciding what we may call her.
0,This child’s fortune is to receive her name from you.” 
0,"The mother left the child in Ceil’s arms, so Ceil returned to cradling her."
0,"Ceil stared at the hopeful smiles of the elderly and future mothers, her eyes full of the fear of being the one to determine the hope for this child’s life."
0,Such a role belonged to the mother and the mother alone.
0,"However, as empress, such requests would not be uncommon if Ceil encountered a new mother, but there was no way for them to know of her true identity."
0,She only had the misfortune of approaching them at the most inopportune time.
0,"“I will name her,” Ceil ceded with great reluctance."
0,Lemi grabbed the elderly dryad’s hand and jumped for joy.
0,"“First, may I have your name and meaning?” Ceil asked the mother."
0,"“Hemma, the flower, but do not feel constrained by me."
0,This is your blessing on the child.”
0,"Hemma was the name of the white flowers that blossomed on the trees in Melia and is mimicked in a Melian’s hair, fitting for a mother of so many children, or perhaps she was blessed as a mother because of her name."
0,“I know her name.
0,Hanvhial.”
0,"Lemi showed no more reaction than the joy of hearing the child’s new name, but Hemma viewed Ceil with awe."
0,She bowed her head in gratitude and reverence to Ceil and the child in her arms.
0,"What the dryads needed most in these dark times were not more children; it was hope, hope of one to rejoin their scattered tribes and lead them."
0,"Hanvhial, the Eternal One."
0,"Through her name, Ceil blessed the child with a long life, a promise that she would grow to become a leader of the dryads, a hamadryad."
0,“Thank you.
0,We truly are blessed you survived.”
0,“Survived?” Ceil panicked.
0,She raised Hemma’s head to look in her eyes.
0,"“Do you know who I am,” she asked with a quiet, quivering voice."
0,“The messenger who led you here brought with her news of your identity.”
0,How did she know who I was?
0,Did she see my tails?
0,I thought I was careful.
0,Was it when I was asleep?
0,"“If you know who I am, then you know of the dangers that follow me.”"
0,"Hemma smiled brightly, further wrinkling her aged face."
0,"“Yes, there are some who do fear, but I yearn for the day you reclaim your throne."
0,You have proven me here that you care dearly about your people.”
0,Ceil handed the infant back into her mother’s arms.
0,“How many know of me?” 
0,Was she even safe here?
0,What about Sammy?
0,“You have no need to fear us.
0,You are free to stay and rest until your companions have recovered.”
0,“It is not you whom I fear.
0,I must see the matriarch.
0,Where is she?”
0,“Our village is small.
0,You will find her if you search.”
1,Ceil thanked Hemma and Lemi and ran towards the center of the village.
0,I can delay no longer.
0,"They may know who I am, but they do not know what happened."
0,"In the two days they had been in the village, Ceil had yet to meet the matriarch, spending most of her time with Sammy and Tyree."
0,"She did not know who to look for, but the matriarch should be the eldest dryad in the village."
0,She glanced at each dryad as she ran but was unsure.
0,"There were women of every age, and none as elderly-appearing as Hemma, but the matriarch could also be like Tyree, younger in appearance despite her age."
0,She approached two dryads who looked older than most others.
0,“I must speak with the matriarch.
0,Do you know where she is?”
0,"“Our village is small,” one of them replied."
0,“You will find her if you search.”
0,“That does not help me.
0,I received that answer already.
0,I do not know what she looks like.”
0,"The two dryads looked at each other, and one came upon a solution."
0,“Wait by your company.
0,We will send her to you.”
0,“Thank you!” 
1,Ceil hurried back to the patch of clover where Sammy and Justin rested.
0,"Nearby, Chloe lay on her back with the other children sitting around her or lying next to or against her."
0,Chloe was panting heavily having exhausted herself.
0,"“Their bodies would be under constant strain from their own weight, and I worry how long they will last.”"
0,"Tyree’s words resounded in Ceil’s ears, and she walked to Chloe’s side with worry pricking her heart."
0,"Chloe was the heaviest of the three humans and yet she rarely ever switched out of her position on the back end of the stretcher, she chased after the scout who discovered Ceil’s tails, and now she had spent all day playing with children."
0,"If Sammy’s weakness was in part due to her body, then Chloe was showing extreme fortitude despite her condition."
0,"“Are you tired,” Ceil asked, unable to think of a better greeting or way to voice her worry."
0,The young dryads perked up and began speaking in the Melian tongue.
0,"They grabbed Ceil’s arms and skirt and gestured their desire to play, but Ceil did not have the time."
0,"She tried explaining this to them, but none of the children understood Elven."
0,"In the end, Chloe was the only one laughing."
0,“They have far too much energy.
0,"After they got me to the ground, I was out."
0,I can’t keep up.”
0,“Do not push yourself.
0,"Tyree said your bodies are… different, that you are under a lot of strain."
0,Is that true?”
0,Chloe opened her eyes and looked up at Ceil.
0,"After a long exhale, she smiled."
0,"“Yah, I guess."
0,I feel like I have all these heavy weights strapped to my body all the time.”
0,“And that’s the same for Sammy?” 
0,"Ceil’s anger crept out in her voice, and Chloe’s face lost its joviality."
0,"“Yah, but I think it’s been affecting her far worse than me.”"
0,Guilt ate at Ceil.
0,“Why did you not say anything?!
0,"We could have slowed down, taken more rests!” "
0,"The children looked up at Ceil, and their startled expressions showed they thought they had done wrong, so Ceil calmed down and tousled some of their mossy hair lightly."
0,“I had no idea you three had this condition.
0,"I thought humans were just heavier than elves, but Tyree said you were different than other humans.”"
0,"“Different from humans here, probably, but everyone is like us where we come from.” "
0,"Chloe looked up at the white, overcast sky."
0,"There was a longing there, and Ceil knew it was for home."
0,"They were strangers here in Melia, in Fiorrae, and in the Amelian Empire."
0,“Where did you come from?”
0,“From somewhere far away.
0,I don’t even know what direction it is from here.”
0,"Ceil sat down, and one of the children jumped on her back and wrapped her arms around Ceil’s neck."
0,Another child sat in her lap and played hand games with another child beside her.
0,"“What is it called, where you are from?” Ceil asked."
0,“Earth.
0,"The city Jethro attacked, where we were living, was called Gullivan.”"
0,Ceil’s eyes fell to the short mossy hair of the child in her lap.
0,She spotted a few tiny round buds that would eventually bloom into flowers that looked like hemma.
0,"She lightly brushed the child’s hair, causing the child to giggle."
0,“I have never heard of such a country or city.”
0,"“It would be a bigger shock if you did,” Chloe chuckled."
0,“Is living there easier for you?
0,Are your bodies better over there?
0,Do you want to go back?”
0,“I don’t think we can.
0,We don’t even know how we got here.
0,"I mean, we think Eydis sent us, but that’s it."
0,And you already heard about all that.” 
0,Chloe grabbed one of the smaller children and lifted her by her waist into the air.
0,She was only able to hold the child aloft for a moment before she had to lower her.
0,She held the child in a light embrace while the child laughed.
0,She then tickled the child’s sides which all the others took as a signal to pile on Chloe and tickle her back.
0,"Chloe was laughing, but now that Ceil was aware of the constant strain that Chloe was under, she saw the pain behind Chloe’s smile."
0,She was playing with the children to help recover emotionally.
0,She was the same as Sammy with similar worries and a similar condition.
0,"The only difference was that Chloe might have been a little stronger and Sammy a lot weaker, weaker because of Ceil."
1,Ceil separated herself and returned to the clover patch to watch the children play on top of Chloe.
0,"Again she longed to join in, and if the village knew her true identity, her tails were no longer an issue."
0,“Should I?” 
0,"Like Sammy and Chloe, she was dealing with a heavy emotional burden, and Chloe had the correct answer."
0,"The matriarch had not appeared yet, so she had time."
0,Perhaps she could grasp at this small possibility of joy.
0,"Ceil sprung to her feet and ran towards the pile of children, but before she could reach them, large talons grabbed her arms, and with the flap of two giant wings, Ceil rose into the air fast enough to grow light-headed."
1,The cold wind assaulted her and made her shiver uncontrollably.
0,She looked up and saw a familiar blue buzzard.
0,“Coby!
0,What are you doing?!
0,Let me down!”
0,Coby flew low along the treetops.
0,Ceil had to swing her body and legs to avoid hitting them.
0,“I thought you left after you were healed!” 
0,"Despite her confusion about Coby’s actions, Ceil was relieved to see him again."
0,"As much of a nuisance as he was, he cared for both Sammy and her in his own way, and Ceil acknowledged that."
0,Coby stopped and flapped his wings at the top of a tall tree.
0,"Once Ceil grabbed onto the thin upper branches, Coby released her."
0,"A few of the branches snapped, but the tree held her."
0,"From her position, she could see the break in the trees far in the distance where the road passed through the forest."
0,"Coby flew in that direction with a cry, and before he could reach the road, a fireball flew up at him followed by a few arrows."
0,Coby weaved in a panic to avoid the attacks.
0,"In Melia, only one group of people would attack Coby with fire magic."
0,Those were humans.
0,"There was a group of them, and they had left the road."
0,"If they continued in her direction, they would end up at the village."
0,"She had been sold out, and she knew by whom."
0,The young messenger did not learn of Ceil’s identity during their short travel together.
0,She knew about it beforehand.
0,That was why she tried to flee but stopped when Ceil ordered her.
0,That was why she disappeared from the village immediately after relaying her message to the matriarch.
0,She reported back to the humans.
0,"“I was wrong,” Ceil bemoaned."
0,"The dryads had surrendered to the humans, so instead of them suspecting the dryads of siding with her against Tolmyur, the humans were using the dryads to capture her."
0,The village was not safe.
0,Ceil’s heart beat heavy in trepidation.
0,Did Tyree refuse to heal Sammy immediately to keep her in the village?
0,Ceil waved her hand in wide gestures and nearly fell from the tree.
0,“Coby!
0,Take me back to the village!”
0,"Coby returned with haste, and with a flap of his giant wings they flew off in the direction of the village."
1,"Once near the clearing, Coby dove down, and Ceil landed on the ground with enough force to make her knees creak and a chill to run up her spine."
0,"The dryads cleared away at the sight of the large bird, a natural predator of the dryads."
0,She looked around for the clover patch where Chloe and Sammy lay.
0,The children were no longer playing.
0,They huddled in fear of Coby who trotted on the ground behind Ceil.
0,An elderly dryad stood next to Chloe.
0,"At a glance, Ceil knew this was the village matriarch, but she no longer had any reason to speak with her."
0,"She wanted to accuse the matriarch of selling her out, for using Sammy to bind her here until the humans arrived, but she could not fault her for it."
0,This was the safest choice for them.
0,"Ceil ignored the matriarch and ran to Chloe, who was sitting up with a child in her lap."
0,“We are leaving.”
0,“Leaving?
0,Why?”
0,“Soldiers are on their way here.
0,The village has tricked us.” 
0,Ceil withheld nothing in front of the matriarch because there was little chance the matriarch of some small village could understand the language of the sprites.
0,Chloe looked past the children at the clover patch.
0,“How?
0,Sammy and Justin can’t leave.”
0,Ceil paced quickly in a circle until Coby nipped at her skirt.
0,“Do something useful!
0,Slow them down!” 
0,"She pointed in the direction of the approaching humans, and Coby understood immediately."
0,He flew up with enough force to knock Ceil to her back in the strength of his wind.
0,Traveling from the road to the village took half a day while carrying an injured man.
0,A small platoon of soldiers could cover that distance in half the time or faster.
0,"This left very little time to escape and gain some distance, unless…"
0,Ceil watched Chloe unsteadily rise to her feet.
0,They could only bring one.
0,She bit her lip and could feel her heart sink into her stomach.
0,"Although she had no attachments to the man, Sammy cared for him dearly, and he was a friend of Chloe’s."
0,“We need to take Sammy and run.”
0,Chloe understood Ceil’s intentions.
0,"Her mouth hung ajar in shock, but the pain in her eyes showed she comprehended the situation they were in."
0,"Chloe had exhausted herself playing with the children, possibly another attempt to weaken their party."
0,"Sammy was too heavy for Ceil to carry alone, and Chloe no longer had the strength either."
0,“We do not have a choice.
0,We need to take Sammy and run!”
0,Chloe looked around.
0,“Where are our bags?
0,The stretcher?”
0,Ceil realized that their meager supplies were relocated without her knowledge.
0,“We do not have time to search for them.” 
0,"She ran to Sammy, tore the mushroom cap and blanket off, and grabbed her under her arms."
0,"Chloe followed and grabbed Sammy’s legs, hooking her knees in her elbows."
0,“Where do we run?”
0,“Adjacent.
0,"If we are lucky, they’ll think we ran in the opposite direction to their approach and lose them."
0,We will change directions as we go.”
0,"“Where are you going,” the matriarch called out as Ceil and Chloe began an unsteady run with Sammy in their arms."
0,“Leave us be!” 
0,"Ceil screamed back, not hiding her ire."
1,Ceil and Chloe crossed the village to the opposite side from where the soldiers were approaching.
0,She saw Hemma sitting against a tree near the edge of the village with Hanvhial in her arms.
0,"“Where are you going,” Hemma called as they passed."
0,Ceil slowed down.
0,Hemma was the only dryad in the village she felt she could trust.
0,“Human soldiers are on their way to the village.
0,We have been sold out.”
0,The shock on Hemma’s face made Ceil’s contort in anguish.
0,Most the villagers may not have even been in on the betrayal.
0,"“We will protect you,” Hemma promised."
0,"“No!” In the shadows of Ceil’s mind, she could see this mother murdered as she tried to protect her child from the humans, just like that nymph in the Gallanvale."
0,All the innocent children of this village were in danger.
0,“No.
0,Helping me would sentence you all to death.
0,"When the humans arrive, tell them that we escaped but you managed to capture one of us."
0,That should appease them.”
0,"“My Lady, there is something you should know before you leave."
0,"One who walks is in Melia, a hamadryad on pilgrimage."
0,Find her.
0,"If you can show her your love for the dryads as you have shown me, she will side with you."
0,We all will side with you.”
0,“Then you all will die.
0,I will not have any more innocent people die for my sake.
0,I am sorry.”
0,Ceil pulled Sammy and Chloe behind her into the forest.
0,She could barely hear Hemma’s final words before the village was far from sight.
0,“Do not lose hope.”
0,"After running for some time, they turned right and traveled perpendicular to their flight deeper into the Melian forests."
1,"* * *
Hemma sprinted to Jenae, the village matriarch, ignoring the cries of her daughter from the shaking of her stride."
0,Her aged body nearly collapsed at Jenae’s feet.
0,"“Hemma, I saw you speaking with Ceil."
0,What has happened?”
0,“Humans are approaching.
0,"She fears we have betrayed her,” Hemma said."
0,“That cannot be.
0,"We would never, could never…”"
0,"Jenae thought upon the anger in the young empress’s voice, and it cut her to her core."
0,That child lost everything and now feared those who should be most loyal to her.
0,Hemma looked over at the grove of clover to the man lying under a woven leaf blanket.
0,“She has left us one of her companions to save our village from the anger of the humans for her escape.
0,"We must convince them to spare him, that he could be of use to them alive perhaps in capturing her or for information, so he may have chance to return to her.”"
0,Jenae fell to her knees and covered her face with her hands.
0,Her fingers pressed hard into her forehead as her heart was racked with the pain of her own incompetence.
0,“How could I have let this happen?
0,That messenger only told us of Ceil’s identity.
0,She must have returned to tell the humans.
0,Other villages have chosen a side in the hunt.
0,"I can only think that in her haste to inform the humans, she forgot to relay the entire message.”"
0,"“Capture the empress and send word,” Hemma guessed."
0,“Ceil must have known some villages were hostile but had no choice but to risk us to help her companions.
0,She deliberately hid her identity from us.
0,This must be why.
0,We have failed her.” 
0,Hemma cradled her daughter close to her neck.
0,“She desires the unity of our people.
0,She named my daughter Hanvhial.”
0,Jenae lifted her head and viewed the infant with admiration.
0,“Then we must help her.
0,"If some villages are seeking her capture, we must correct them."
0,We will spread the word that our empress is in our midst and is fighting for us.
0,We must not succumb to the humans’ plot.
0,I will personally seek out the hamadryad.
0,She must meet Lady Ceil.”
0,“What of her companion?
0,The humans might kill him.”
0,"“I will protect him,” Tyree said, appearing behind Jenae and placing her hand on her shoulder."
0,"“By my life, I will make certain he is reunited with her.”"
0,"“The humans will take you,” Jenae said, worried for her younger sister."
0,"“So be it,” Tyree replied with confidence."
0,"Jenae nodded, proud of her sister’s conviction."
0,"“Hemma, while I seek out the hamadryad and Tyree joins Ceil’s companion in captivity, you will be matriarch.”"
0,“Understood.” Hemma bowed low.
0,“Gather all the youth who are not anthousai.
0,Include the young adults who are not with children.
0,We need every able messenger.”

“The Otherworldly Threat”
Byurk"
1,“Shoot it down!” 
0,Byurk kicked his heel into the ground.
0,"Dirt, rock, and mud shot up like a geyser, and with a quick swipe of his hand, he removed the moisture leaving a solid earth pillar."
0,"The incoming blade of wind impacted it and dispersed, but the pillar crumbled on top of him."
0,“Can no one ground that bird?!”
0,"This same Habha had accosted them twice before, and they had driven it off, but now it returned after gaining some purpose and assaulted them with unbridled tenacity."
0,Byurk’s powerful defense and the dense canopy provided some protection.
0,"Only one member of his hand-picked team was injured and not severely, but they were losing precious time."
0,Byurk could only trust that the Melians followed the orders in his message and captured the emperor’s wife and her companions.
0,"“Sir, we are nearly out of arrows!”"
0,“Use them all!
0,The Melians can craft us more!
0,And keep moving forward!
0,We must reach that village!”
0,"“Sir, I am out of ven!” "
0,"Byurk raised his hand as if he was lifting a heavy stone, and earth bumped up from underneath his final exhausted fire mage, knocking him to the side as a smaller blade of wind passed by and into the trunk of a tree beside them."
0,"The bark shattered and some of the wood splintered, but it did not cut through."
0,The attacks were growing weaker.
0,“It cannot continue the attack much longer!
0,Move!”
0,The group of thirty-two soldiers increased their march with Byurk and another earth mage focused on defense.
0,“I think I hit it!”
0,"“No, the arrow just hit its feathers!” "
0,“Less talking; more focus!” 
0,Byurk kicked the minum beside him to the ground and dropped to avoid another blade of wind.
0,"The soldiers behind him jumped back, and it impacted the ground between them."
0,The blade was small.
0,“Sir! I think it is retreating.”
0,"Byurk waited for another attack, but none came, and the Habha was no longer visible."
0,"He turned to his dirt-splattered, physically and ven exhausted party."
0,“I chose you all for this vital mission because you were supposed to be competent!
0,Why the gods could you not kill one bird?!” 
0,Byurk’s men looked at him with shamed faces.
0,"He wanted to tell them that had this been a stronger beast, they would all be dead."
0,Byurk had spent his youth hunting dragons north of Stollmuk with dwarven parties half this number.
0,Seeing his chosen men fail to kill a single bird was aggravating.
0,He took a moment to breathe out his frustration and calm down.
0,“Is anyone besides Mak injured?”
0,"The men looked around at each other, and one of his archers responded."
0,"“No, sir.” "
0,The sole injured swordsman was wrapping the shallow cut on his left forearm.
0,"“Sir, if I may?”"
0,“Speak while we march.
0,We lost precious time.” 
1,"At his order, the men increased their march, and the archer hurried to Byurk’s side."
0,“That one was not like the other buzzards.
0,It was larger and had two yellow plumes on its head.”
0,“What are you saying?”
0,"“I’ve shot many of them, and most have no plumes.” "
0,"“You are saying that one was a different breed, or the alpha?” "
0,"“Possibly, but we have never had problems killing them like this."
0,"The forward platoon that was wiped out, if the wife is at the village, then it might have been the same one.”"
0,“A Habha trained by the wife.”
0," “Exactly, sir.” "
0," If she can raise or weaponize these birds to this degree, that wife was more of a danger than Byurk thought."
0,“Girl! How long until we reach the village?”
0,The young Melian messenger ran beside Byurk.
0,She was unharmed and not the least bit exhausted from their march.
0,Byurk could not help but be amazed at her energy.
0,"“We are soon,” she replied in broken Elven."
0,“How soon?”
0,“Soon soon.” 
0,“Good.” He turned back to his men.
0,"“I know you are tired, but be prepared for another battle."
0,We do not know what to expect when we reach the village.”
0,His men roared with confidence.
1,They continued the march and arrived at the border of the village.
0,"They stepped into the clearing with weapons drawn, but what met Byurk could only be described as a Melian ghost town."
0,"There were only about thirty adult Melians, all elderly, in the clearing."
0,"Aside from them were a handful of children and three young Melians with white, speckled hair."
0,“Where are all the adults?” 
0,He looked around at his men who bore the same confused expressions.
0,“Bring me the matriarch!”
0,"“I am here,” replied a very elderly Melian with skin like coarse, wrinkled fabric."
0,She handed the infant she carried to one of the young Melians with completely white hair and approached slowly.
0,"“I thought you would arrive sooner, but I see you had trouble.”"
0,“Where is the widow of the late emperor?
0,"She was here in this village, correct?” "
0,"He looked at the messenger, and she nodded her head enthusiastically."
0,"“Yes, she was here,” the matriarch replied."
0,"Byurk knew instantly that the Melians had either lost her, let her escape, or they could have even helped her."
0,"The village was empty, so there was a possibility that many of them fled in fear of retribution."
0,"But thinking it over, they would have taken their children, even if they had no choice but to leave their elderly."
0,The Melians were not the type of people to save themselves if it meant abandoning their young.
0,They were too good-natured for that.
0,The state of this village made no sense.
0,"“Tell me everything,” Byurk ordered."
0,“This child that brought you to our village also brought with her the one you seek.
0,"She informed us of the High Elf’s identity, relayed her message, and left to find you."
0,The emperor’s wife came to us with a request to heal her companions.
0,"We thought that would keep her here long enough for you to arrive, but she learned of your approach from her Habha, and in the confusion it caused, she escaped.”"
0,The matriarch confirmed the suspicion of his men.
0,That Habha was trained by the wife.
0,"However, the matriarch’s story did not explain the state of the village."
0,“What are you not telling me?
0,I assume your village is not made of solely children and elderly.
0,You would not be opposed to us searching your village.”
0,The matriarch smiled.
0,“There is no need.
0,Follow me.”
1,"Byurk’s men followed behind with weapons drawn, waiting for a possible attack."
0,"While they walked, the matriarch continued her explanation."
0,"“The Habha caused a lot of chaos, and by the time it flew off, I presume after you given the direction it flew, we noticed the wife was missing."
0,"We did not see which way she fled, so we sent all who were able to search for her.”"
0,Byurk rubbed his greying beard and then looked up at the matriarch.
0,"“That could explain the missing Melians, but where are you leading us?”"
0,“Here.” 
0,They approached a thick patch of clover where lay a single man covered by a blanket woven from leaves.
0,Beside him was the indent of where Byurk supposed another had been.
0,“This is one of her companions.
0,He is still injured and so was easy to capture.
0,We have him sleeping for now.” 
0,"The matriarch called to her villagers, and four approached carrying supplies, dropping them at the edge of the patch of clover."
0,“These are their belongings.
0,They were left behind.
0,You may search through them if you wish.”
0,"Byurk waved his hand, and five of his men retrieved the belongings which included a staff and sword, three leather sacks, a belt, and a small medicine pouch."
0,"The sword, belt, and pouch were standard military equipment of the Tolmyur army."
0,This worried Byurk because it meant that the humans accompanying the wife could in fact be soldiers that had either defected or were under some other influence.
0,They would not be hunter mercenaries as he thought.
0,"Then again, they could have looted these supplies from the forward party they killed using the Habha."
0,"Byurk did not want to believe that any soldiers from Tolmyur would defect, and that powerful fire mage was still a concern that lingered on his mind."
0,"The sacks contained scavenged food provisions, a few skirts and sashes, and extra medicine, simple beiju from the smell."
0,"There was nothing remarkable, and all of it could be discarded with no major loss for the wife or her party."
0,Byurk walked over the deep clover and peered down at the man.
0,“Who is he?”
0,"“Aside from one of her companions, we do not know,” the matriarch replied."
0,“Wake him.” 
0,"For the first time, the matriarch looked hesitant, and this caused doubt to grow in the depths of Byurk’s mind."
0,"“Wake him,” Byurk ordered again."
0,Another elderly Melian with a young face and smooth complexion approached.
0,“I would rather not.”
0,“And you are?” 
0,The Melian bowed deeply.
0,"“Tyree, the village’s shaman."
0,This man has been in my care since his arrival.
0,He came to us with nothing but his will keeping him alive.
0,I had never seen such a living corpse in all my years.”
0,“Is he alive?” 
0,"“Yes, but--” "
0,“Wake him!” Byurk was losing his patience with the village.
0,"If he could not confirm that this man was truly a member of the wife’s party, then this all could be a ruse to stall for time, and he would be forced to use undesirable methods to extract the truth from these dryads who had sided with the wife."
0,"The matriarch and shaman exchanged a few words in the Melian language, and then the shaman walked over to the sleeping man."
0,“I cannot say how coherent he will be when he wakes after being so close to death.”
0,Byurk glared at the shaman as she placed her hand on the man’s head.
0,"When she retracted it, nothing happened, and as Byurk waited, nothing happened still."
0,"If the man was not slowly breathing, he would have assumed him dead."
0,“Do you make a fool of me?”
0,"Much to Byurk’s surprise, the shaman glared at him."
0,“I restored his consciousness as you asked.
0,"I could shock him awake for you, but with how weak his body is, it could kill him."
0,Is that what you want?”
0,Byurk sighed.
0,“How long?” 
0,"The shaman did not answer, so Byurk moved beside the sleeping man."
0,He yanked off the leaf blanket and saw the strange clothing the man wore.
0,He recognized it and stepped back in shock.
0,It resembled the clothing at the palace that Jethro obtained from the other world to disguise his assassins who sought the princess.
0,The tough and tightly woven blue fabric of the pants was an unmistakable sign.
0,"“It cannot be… The other humans with the wife, did they wear strange clothing like this?"
0,Was their clothing unlike anything from Amel or the Tolmyur Kingdom or anywhere else you have seen?”
0,The shaman and matriarch exchanged confused glances.
0,"“The wife was different, but the Humans with her were dressed similarly.”"
0,Byurk turned to his soldiers.
0,“We will take him with us and question him when he wakes.
0,We must hurry.”
0,"“You must be gentle with him,” the shaman protested."
0,“We do not have such luxury.”
0,“Let me join you.
0,I will take care of him and see to it that he is healthy enough to answer your questions.”
0,“Perfect.
0,"I also have a request, and if you fulfill it, I will see to it that both you and your village are rewarded.”"
0,“Rewarded?
0,What is your request?” Tyree asked.
0,“Hurry and tie him up!”
0,"Byurk shouted to his men, and no more than a few seconds later, two of his soldiers brought rope to bind the man."
0,"“Before I say my request, I first demand you tell me the truth."
0,Do or do you not know where the wife has fled?”
0,The matriarch was quick to answer.
0,"“We do not, and even if we did help her escape, we would not know where she is now or her heading.”"
0,“Well enough.
0,I demand you take me to the one who walks.
0,I must speak with your hamadryad.
0,I expect you know how to find her.
0,"The pilgrimage routes are set, are they not?”"
0,"“It is as you say,” the matriarch replied."
0,“That is my request.
0,"Tyree, you will guide us.”"
0,The archer approached Byurk with trouble in his eyes.
0,“Are we no longer pursuing the wife?”
0,“We may not be able to handle her on our own.
0,She has become a far greater threat than any of us or our Commanding General ever anticipated.”
0,“Sir?” 
0,“She is receiving aid from the other world.”

“Misdirected Hatred”
Ceil"
1,"“Please, Ceil… I need… Can we stop… just for a…” "
0,"Chloe dropped to a knee and hacked out a large wad of viscous saliva, spitting it to the side."
0,Her hot breath dispersed in large puffs of white in the clear night air.
0,"She may have been stronger than Sammy, but her already exhausted body had far greater limitations than Ceil’s, something Ceil had only just learned in the village."
0,"Ceil turned Sammy, wrapped Sammy’s arms over her shoulders and across her chest, and lifted her."
0,"Sammy was short enough that her feet did not drag on the ground, but that did not make walking any easier."
0,“I will carry her.
0,We cannot stop.” 
1,"Although Ceil urged Chloe to keep moving, her own feet would not move faster than an unsteady walk under Sammy’s unnatural weight, and after another hour she too surrendered to exhaustion."
0,"They had not traveled far from the village, only about the same distance the road had been, so if the humans picked up their trail, they would be upon them quickly."
0,"The overcast clouds of earlier that day had cleared to a cold, star-filled sky."
0,"The largest moon was bright and nearly full, casting shadows from the trees to the forest floor."
0,"This was a night to be spotted, so they could not risk stopping, but neither she nor Chloe had the energy to move further."
0,"Despite how much Ceil wanted to keep moving, they could not."
0,"“We camp here, no fire,” Ceil ordered, laying Sammy on the cold forest floor."
0,She placed her hand on the ground and concentrated her life ven into the sparse earth.
0,"The ground moss grew quickly, but when the ground where her fingers touched turned black, she quickly retracted her hands."
0,"She should have been able to continue longer, but in her exhaustion, she couldn’t suppress the darkness in her that always tried to creep out whenever she manipulated life."
0,The patch of leafy moss was just barely large enough to fit the three of them if not a little too small.
0,She hoped it would be sufficient to insulate them from the cold soil.
0,Chloe slid Sammy onto the moss.
0,She removed her long-sleeved top and draped it over her.
0,“Why hasn’t Sammy woken?
0,"She was just sleeping, wasn’t she?”"
0,"Ceil also found this odd, but in their flight, she lacked the freedom to worry about anything but escape."
0,“I do not know.
0,"If her illness is that severe, she might not for a while.”"
0,“Wasn’t it just exhaustion?” Chloe asked.
0,Ceil could not answer.
0,Sammy’s state could very well have been because of the mark on her neck.
0,"Tyree claimed that she healed Sammy, but what if that was a lie and Sammy was only growing worse?"
0,She had to find out.
0,Ceil took a few deep breaths to calm herself.
0,"She was only reading Sammy’s life, not manipulating it."
0,No alterations or changes.
0,"She was not healing Sammy, so the dark magic would not activate."
0,"She had to remind herself that she had been checking that man’s vitals for days without issue, but somehow when it came to Sammy, she still feared ill might befall her."
0,Her trembling hand rested on Sammy’s forehead and sent a pulse through Sammy’s body.
0,The truth came surprisingly quickly.
0,"“Sammy’s consciousness is clouded,” she said with relief."
0,"Life was still twisted where the mark remained on Sammy’s neck, which she could not heal for fear of worsening it, but Tyree had told the truth."
0,"There were no longer any adverse effects on Sammy’s health from the mark, but that did not rid Tyree of suspicion."
0,“Clouded?”
0,"“Stopped, or perhaps blocked might be a better word."
0,That shaman must have done it to keep us in the village.
0,I will try to wake her.”
0,Ceil placed her hand on Sammy’s forehead but hesitated.
0,"This time, she would be manipulating life even if for a moment."
0,"She lacked skill in the healing aspects of life magic, and affecting the mind was a far more advanced form."
0,"If she could not wake Sammy, Ceil feared that Sammy may never wake."
0,"She could not trust another dryad village to help her, so it had to be her."
0,The only assurance Ceil had in her ability to attempt it safely was that locating the direct cause only involved reading the surface of Sammy’s consciousness.
0,"Once found, the remedy should be swift, she hoped."
0,But she hesitated again.
0,Now was not the time.
0,"“No, I will try in the morning when I am rested."
0,You should sleep.
0,I will keep first watch.”
0,“Okay.” 
0,Chloe lay down and shifted close to Sammy to keep her warm.
0,Ceil removed her skirt and laid it over them.
0,"She shivered naked in the cold night, but the chill would help her stay awake, in case the fear of the approaching humans was insufficient motivation to overcome her exhaustion."
1,The next morning came without incident.
0,Chloe woke Ceil at sunrise as requested.
0,"Once her drowsiness left her, she prepared mentally for the task she postponed."
0,Ceil rested her hand on Sammy’s forehead and closed her eyes.
0,"She treaded lightly in Sammy’s mind, like running her finger across the surface of water, too afraid to dip it in."
0,"She tapped the water and felt the ripples travel, searching for the obstruction by retracing where the subtle pulse rebounded."
0,"Even Eydis who excelled in the healing aspects of life magic was unskilled with this level of magic, but Eydis had done it to Ceil in her darkest moments of fear of the approaching announcement of her marriage to the emperor, fears that now seem so small compared to the reality Ceil was living."
0,"Eydis touched her mind, felt her emotions, and helped block the fear, but the effort left Eydis exhausted."
0,"Even now, Ceil could feel her ven levels plummeting the longer she was in Sammy’s mind."
0,"She continued tapping the waters again, tracing the rebounding ripples."
0,"The sun rose above the canopy, showering flecks of light about them."
0,"The humans had not located them, so she felt she had time, but this did not mean they were not eagerly searching."
0,Ceil fought within herself whether to carry Sammy or spend as much time as needed to wake her because they could move faster with Sammy awake.
0,"The longer her search for the obstruction in Sammy’s conscious continued, the more she felt carrying Sammy was the better option, but when a ripple returned almost immediately, she threw the questions from her mind."
0,“I am close.”
0,"Chloe watched with all eagerness the two bodies still as statues, completely ignorant to the intricate search happening beyond physical sight."
0,"Ceil tapped the still waters again, but this time no ripple formed."
0,"The surface felt not unlike a film had been placed over it, as intangible as a thought and yet impermeable."
0,"She could tell what lay beneath was agitated, undulating, and trying to break through."
0,It had to be the source that blocked her mind and kept her from waking.
0,"Now came the moment Ceil feared, but she could not hesitate without losing the position she had spent so long locating."
0,"She reached with the fingers of her ven and pinched the film, lifting it like a cloth from the water."
0,"The film resisted, but Ceil forced it free."
0,"Sammy shot up, eyes wide and with heavy breath."
0,She broke into a subdued cry of pain and Ceil feared she did something terribly wrong.
0,“Sammy!
0,What is wrong?!
0,Are you hurt?!” 
0,"Sammy reached across her chest for her shoulders, but the motion caused her to lurch forward and cry out."
0,"“My shoulders, they’re burning,” Sammy cried in a high-pitched squeal."
0,Ceil sighed in relief and began massaging Sammy’s shoulders.
0,Chloe joined in and warmed them to help work out the tension.
0,“What happened?
0,"Why do my shoulders hurt,” Sammy asked once she could tolerate the ache."
0,“We were carrying you.
0,We did not have the stretcher.
0,Your shoulders supported you for over half a day…” 
0,Sammy’s weight was the obvious cause.
0,"Had she been an elf, or at least a regular human, she would be fine."
0,Ceil’s anger at her own ignorance and the secret that Sammy had never told her resurfaced.
0,“Why did you not tell me?”
0,Sammy did not understand the reason for Ceil’s troubled expression.
0,“Why did you not tell me what kind of strain you are under every day?
0,Why did you never say that your own bodies are crushing you?
0,I would have slowed down for you.
0,We could have taken more time so that you would be less burdened… 
0,I would not have forced you to take care of me…” 
0,Ceil’s anger gave way to the guilt caused by her own weakness.
0,Sammy ignored Ceil’s questions and heavy emotions.
0,Her eyes inspected the unfamiliar forest.
0,There was no clearing.
0,There were no dryads.
0,They were not at the village.
0,“You carried me?” 
0,She frantically looked around.
0,They were alone.
0,"Just Chloe, Ceil, and her."
0,Justin was nowhere to be seen.
0,"“Ceil, where is Justin?” "
0,She grabbed Ceil’s arm.
0,“What happened?
0,Tell me!
0,Where is Justin?!”
0,Ceil stood and paced as her guilt boiled within her.
0,"Unable to contain it any longer, it burst out in a distraught yell."
0,“I told you!
0,I warned you!
0,"I said that if you collapsed and we had to make a choice, we would leave him behind."
0,Do you think I wanted to leave him?”
0,“You left him somewhere?” 
0,"Sammy stood unsteadily on her feet, her arms quivering in anger."
0,“You never cared about Justin from the beginning!
0,You never once referred to him by name.
0,You only treated him because I asked you.
0,"To you he was nothing but extra baggage, but to me, he is everything!"
0,"I tried so hard to save him, and now that he finally got help… You abandoned him!”"
0,“I said we had no choice!” 
0,“You always have a fucking choice!” 
0,"Sammy threw a ball of water at Ceil, and it splashed hard against her right cheek leaving the side of her face pink."
0,"“You had a choice, and you chose to leave him!”"
0,Ceil’s face stung.
0,"Despite the ball’s size, it had a lot of force behind it."
0,"She was angry, but she did not retaliate."
0,"When a second hit her mouth, she stood her ground."
0,She could not look back at Sammy.
0,"If Sammy wanted to take out her anger, Ceil felt she had the right."
0,She made the decision to leave Justin.
0,"Chloe went along with it, but the decision was hers alone."
0,“Sammy!
0,Stop!”
0,Ceil raised her head to see Chloe grabbing Sammy from behind.
0,"Sammy held a third ball of water in her right hand, larger than the previous two."
0,She shirked Chloe off and tossed the ball.
0,"Expecting it to only sting like the last, Ceil did not dodge it, but when it impacted her chest, it burst."
0,The blow knocked Ceil to her back.
0,Her chest burned.
0,That was not a ball of water thrown in anger.
0,That was an attack.
0,The guilt in Ceil’s heart vanished.
0,"She stood and walked over to where Chloe was struggling to subdue Sammy, and kicked Sammy in the stomach."
0,Both Sammy and Chloe fell back into the small patch of moss.
0,"Ceil placed her hand on the trunk of the tree beside them, and roots shot up out of the ground, wrapping tight around Sammy, binding her arms, neck, and mouth."
0,Chloe barely broke away before she too was ensnared.
0,Ceil’s face could not hide her ire.
0,She could tolerate Sammy’s anger.
0,She knew she would be angry with her decision.
0,"But, what she could not ignore was being attacked by a human."
0,Ceil looked down at Sammy who had not lost her fire despite being bound.
0,"“If you want to know the truth, I will tell you."
0,"Yes, I hate him.” "
0,Sammy’s face grew red.
0,She howled through the roots that ran across her mouth between her teeth.
0,“I hate him.
0,"I cannot accept that Eydis, the future Empress of the Amelian Empire chose a human as a lover."
0,I admit it!
0,I hate humans!
0,I despise everything about them.
0,I wish they were all dead.”
0,"The trunk of the tree where Ceil placed her hand blackened, but she did not remove it."
0,Withered leaves slowly drifted down.
0,"Several of them were black and brittle, almost dissolving once they hit the ground."
0,“Ceil! That’s enough!” 
0,Chloe pleaded with Ceil as she tugged at the roots that were still tightening around Sammy’s neck.
0,“We fled the village because those humans learned we were there.
0,They were so close that we did not have the time to gather our belongings and prepare a way to take you both.
0,"If they caught us, they would have killed all of us."
0,"I could have run off on my own, but I chose to save you!"
0,The only human I feel I can trust!
0,Which is why…” 
0,Ceil licked her lips and found the faint taste of iron from where the second ball of water cracked the corner of her lip.
0,“…which is why I will not forgive you if you ever raise your hand against me.”
0,"The red anger faded from Sammy’s face, and she stared at Ceil with wide eyes."
0,“Do you truly believe that I wanted to leave him behind?
0,Do you truly believe that I wanted to betray the trust of you who I relied on and who comforted me when I fell again into darkness?” 
0,Ceil removed her hand from the tree.
0,Chloe broke and pried the roots off Sammy before the blackening reached her.
0,"The tree above them was now barren of life, slowly crumbling from the thinnest top branches."
0,“The dryads know he was a member of our group.
0,They will tell the soldiers.
0,"Because we fled, there is a chance that the soldiers will not kill him and use him to get to us.”"
0,"Sammy sat up, and tears welled in her eyes."
0,"“But if they think we abandoned him, they might decide he is useless to them."
0,There was always a chance that Justin would die one day or the next.
0,"We finally found him help, and now he could die again?"
0,I’m tired of chances!” 
0,"She stood up and brushed off the remaining roots, wincing in pain from moving her sore shoulders."
0,"Her anger had not left, but she did not lash out at Ceil."
0,“What direction is the village?
0,I’m going back.”
0,Ceil did not answer.
0,"If the humans were still there, or even if only a few of them were, returning would not only endanger Sammy but also the innocent dryads in the village."
0,Sammy grew frustrated at Ceil’s silence.
0,“Why did we come to Melia?
0,Why were we seeking out a dryad village in the first place?”
0,"Ceil immediately understood, and her guilt resurfaced."
0,Her eyes fell away to the soot of the once verdant leaves on the ground.
0,“We came here because of Justin.
0,"We risked running into soldiers, risked your identity being revealed to Save. His. Life!"
0,"We ran into soldiers, your identity is known, and now you want to abandon the whole reason we came here in the first place?"
0,I’m going back.”
0,"“I’ll take you,” Chloe replied."
0,"When Chloe and Sammy began walking away, Ceil finally mustered the will to respond."
0,“Returning to that village will place them in even more danger.
0,They already know who I am.
0,"We need to warn other villages, not chase after that man.” "
0,The words Ceil spoke felt empty in her mouth.
0,"That village chose to side with the humans, and many more would have done the same."
0,Her fears no longer held the same weight.
0,The humans were not a danger to the villages.
0,The villages were a danger to her.
0,Sammy stopped walking and turned on the ball of her foot to face Ceil one final time.
0,“You lived with the sprites for a while.
0,How much did the Arkhon tell you about this war?
0,"You may be important, but guess what?"
0,So is Justin.
0,I promised the Arkhon that Justin would survive.
0,Go ahead and run to the other villages.
0,Chloe and I will save him.”
1,"Sammy and Chloe ran off while Ceil watched, and once they were out of sight, she dropped to her knees."
0,There was truth to Sammy’s words.
0,She heard similar about herself when her personal Namie teleported her to Fiorrae.
0,"“Darker times are to come, but you have a purpose in this tale,” Ceil whispered under her breath, and the words repeated over and over in her mind."
0,She grabbed a handful of the black soot and watched as it broke into even finer powder in her grip and drifted away in the light morning breeze.
0,"Behind her, the wide trunk of the tree cracked and split, falling to the ground on both sides of her."
0,"The thick branches shattered on impact with the ground like fragile pottery, but she did not startle."
0,Why did the sprites not tell her that Justin was the same as her?
0,Why did the Sprite Arkhon tell only Sammy?
0,"If he had told her, she would not have chosen to abandon him."
0,Or would I?
0,"Ceil hated Justin, and she felt her reasons were not unfounded."
0,Humans were her enemy.
0,"They killed her parents, her hometown, and countless innocent people to target her."
0,Justin was a human.
0,Chloe was a human.
0,Even Sammy was a human… but she could not hate Sammy.
0,“Why?
0,Why is Sammy so different?
0,What if she is not different?
0,She could be a human like all the others!
0,She could be using me to help Justin and then will turn on me like the dryads!”
0,"Ceil’s heart ached, and she knew her own words were lies."
0,"The sprites would not have aided them if Sammy was an enemy, especially not the Sprite Arkhon."
0,"If Sammy did not care about her, she would not have worked herself to collapsing to take care of her, fighting through the illness that Ceil beset on her in anger, the same evil magic that could destroy an ageless tree making it no more than dust in Ceil’s hands."
0,Sammy’s rage at Ceil’s abandonment of Justin was because she trusted Ceil.
0,"Sammy may be a human, but she was not like her enemies."
0,"She was different, not just from another location, but a completely different type of human than those of the Tolmyur Kingdom."
0,They sheltered and befriended Eydis.
0,"Eydis chose a lover among them, Justin."
0,Eydis never would have done so if they were the Amelian Empire’s enemies.
0,The Tolmyur Kingdom attacked Sammy’s city.
0,They never would have done so if they were allies.
0,Ceil’s enemy was not humanity.
0,Her enemy was the Tolmyur Kingdom.
0,“That is what the Sprite Arkhon wanted me to learn…” 
0,Ceil shrunk from her own incompetence.
0,"The truth was in front of her the entire time and yet she was so blinded by her hatred of the humans to see it, and that blindness hurt Sammy, the only person remaining that she could call a friend."
1,Ceil ran after Sammy and Chloe.
0,Her light and limber body caught up quickly to the two humans who were having trouble keeping a running pace due to their weight.
0,"Ceil prepared for backlash from Sammy, but what Sammy said surprised her."
0,“Took you long enough to catch up.”
0,Ceil once again realized how much Sammy trusted her.
0,"“Just so you know,” Sammy continued, “I haven’t forgiven you for abandoning Justin.”"
0,"“And I have not forgiven you for attacking me,” Ceil retorted."
0,"“But, you have every right to be angry."
0,I apologize.”
0,Sammy smiled between heavy breaths.
0,“Save it for Justin when you finally meet him.”
1,They reached the village in only a few hours.
0,"Sammy spent most of her time in the village unconscious, so she did not notice any difference, but Chloe and Ceil were in shock at the lack of dryads in the clearing."
0,“Lemi!” Ceil spotted the excessively blooming anthousai immediately and ran to her.
0,"“Lemi, what happened here?” "
0,"She feared that the humans had done something terrible, possibly killing most of the village for suspecting them of helping her escape."
0,Lemi was not distraught but excited to see Ceil.
0,“Come. Speak with Hemma.”
1,"Lemi led them across the clearing, and every dryad that saw Ceil and her companions followed."
0,Hemma sat near the bed of clover holding her daughter with her finger in her daughter’s mouth.
0,"When she saw Ceil, she sprung to her feet and quickly passed her daughter off to another while her daughter cried in protest."
0,Hemma then prostrated herself in front of Ceil.
0,"“Your Highness, I am so grateful you are safe."
0,Please understand that we did not call the humans here.”
0,Whether or not they informed the soldiers was no longer important.
0,Ceil reached down and pulled Hemma up by her arm.
0,“What happened to the village?
0,Where is everyone?” 
0,"Ceil steeled her emotions, preparing for the worst of news."
0,“Our village is safe.
0,"By your wisdom in leaving your companion with us, we were spared.”"
0,"Relief washed over Ceil, but this was no time for rejoicing."
0,Justin was no longer lying in the clover.
0,“What of my companion?”
0,“They bound him in rope and carried him with them.
0,"When their commander saw him, he grew fearful."
0,Who is your companion that he would inspire such terror in a commander of Tolmyur’s forces?”
0,Ceil looked at Sammy who was oblivious to the Elven conversation and waiting anxiously for any news of Justin.
0,All Ceil knew about Justin was that he was Eydis’s lover.
0,"According to Sammy, the Sprite Arkhon said Justin was important to the war."
0,Did he have such a great significance that even the military leaders of Tolmyur knew of him?
0,Ceil began to fear that she had made a terrible mistake in leaving Justin behind.
0,"What if he was a political figure of his homeland, like a prince--the reason Eydis chose him as her partner--and in her ignorance of his standing, she abandoned him to death?"
0,Sammy’s overprotectiveness could be due to her position as his retainer or servant or perhaps a mistress or concubine.
0,What if this brought the humans of Sammy’s homeland into the war against the empire because of her foolish hatred?
0,"Ceil’s depression and anxiety resurfaced, rising and threatening to drown her in its murk."
0,What had she done?
0,"She turned to Sammy, terrified."
0,“Sammy… Who is Justin?
0,Why would Tolmyur commanders fear him?”
0,Sammy did not answer but grew panicked instead.
0,“What happened to Justin?!”
0,"“They bound him and took him away,” Ceil answered quickly."
0,She turned to Hemma.
0,“Did the soldiers say anything?
0,What are they to do with him?”
0,“They want to question him when he wakes.
0,Tyree is there to protect him.
0,They are headed for the hamadryad.
0,I fear they want to use him to sway her to side with the humans against you.
0,"Jenae, our matriarch, left ahead of them to meet first with the hamadryad.”"
0,"“Then I too will meet with the hamadryad,” Ceil said."
0,"Hemma bowed her head in gratitude, but Ceil lifted her again."
0,“How may I find her?”
0,Hemma searched the crowd and found the one dryad who could best act as guide.
0,"“Lemi, do you remember the locations of the villages?”"
0,Lemi’s face brightened with excitement.
0,“Yes!”
0,“And you know the pilgrimage route.” 
0,"“Yes,” she repeated."
0,Ceil was shocked by the decision.
0,“Are you sure sending an anthousai is safe?
0,What if something happens to her?
0,She could be with child.”
0,"Lemi’s countenance fell, and Ceil tried to assure her that her question was not due to her lack of confidence in the girl."
0,Hemma asserted her decision.
0,“Lemi was personal witness to your heart when naming my daughter.
0,Her testimony may be vital in convincing the hamadryad.
0,It must be her.”
0,"Ceil worried about exposing an innocent girl to such dangers but then had to remind herself that despite Lemi’s appearance, she was likely four or five times Ceil’s age."
0,Dryads aged much slower and lived much longer than elves.
0,"Lemi’s maturity was still in question, but she still carried the knowledge of years far beyond Ceil’s own."
0,"“Then I will be happy to have her as a guide,” Ceil replied."
0,“Do you still have our belongings?”
0,Hemma waved her hand and a Dryad approached carrying Ceil’s staff.
0,"“They claimed your provisions and weapons as their own, leaving only your staff.”"
0,"Ceil could do without the food, medicine, and the sword."
0,They could travel with only the clothing about their waists.
0,"The staff was unremarkable in appearance, but it was irreplaceable wood from Fiorrae."
0,She would not find a tree with such a capacity for life in Melia or anywhere else.
0,“Thank you.
0,This is enough.”
0,“Hardly enough.
0,How could we send you against the soldiers of Tolmyur with naught but a staff?”
0,"Ceil was taken aback by the sudden change from Hemma’s subservient attitude to the same casual tone she had used when they first met, and somehow, she felt more at ease because of it."
0,“Give our empress and her friends a proper sendoff.”
0,"At Hemma’s command, the crowd of dryads scattered, including Lemi who hurried off to make preparations of her own."
1,"Ceil, Sammy, and Chloe sat in the clover next to Hemma while they waited."
0,"Sammy and Ceil were anxious, wanting to leave as soon as possible, but Chloe was preoccupied with Hanvhial in her arms, resting her over her chest and bouncing her lightly."
0,"“If dryads don’t have nipples, how do they feed their babies?”"
0,Sammy and Ceil stared dumfounded at Chloe’s out of place question and then looked at each other.
0,"“What are you looking at me for,” Sammy protested to Ceil."
0,“How am I supposed to know?
0,Maybe they photosynthesize or something and don’t need to feed?”
0,"Ceil felt a little embarrassed asking, but she posed Chloe’s question to Hemma."
0,"She knew little about dryad biology, and she would never admit that she was also curious."
0,Hemma chuckled lightly.
0,“Our breasts are like yours.
0,"They store nutrients for our young, but we can secrete it anywhere through our skin."
0,"They do not need to suck on our breasts, although many mothers still feed this way."
0,"Over my many years and many daughters, I found a much simpler method.”"
0,Ceil quickly made the connection.
0,“When you place your finger in her mouth.”
0,Hemma’s smile was her affirmation.
0,"“Although we are closer kin to plants than elves, our bodies are not all that different.” "
0,She placed her hand on her forehead.
0,“We have minds like you.” 
0,She moved her hand on her chest.
0,“We have hearts and lungs like you.” 
0,To her stomach.
0,“We must eat to survive like you.” 
0,She then moved her hand to her abdomen.
0,"“Although conception is different, we rear our children like you,” and after moving her hand to her womanhood, she finished, “and we bring them into the world the same way."
0,There is a legend that in ancient times a powerful Grassland Elf hermit of the Celadrian created the first dryad out of a desire for companionship in his isolation.”
0,Ceil watched the dryads of the village.
0,She realized that their body proportions and facial structure was nearly identical to a High Elf.
0,Their ears were even the same aside from being a little shorter.
0,She felt the High Elves were taller but then realized that the men were taller.
0,All dryads were female and about as tall as High Elf women would be.
0,"Ceil, who was short for a High Elf, was as tall as, if not a little shorter than, Lemi who in appearance was a year younger."
0,"When Lemi grew to adulthood, she would be taller, the height of any High Elf woman."
0,"“You might be right,” Ceil replied."
0,Hemma chuckled again.
0,"“It is only a legend, but we believe it because it helps us feel a personal connection to you and your empire."
0,"The dryads surrendered to Tolmyur out of necessity in our lack of leadership to protect each other, but if your desire is to reclaim your empire, I know the dryads will stand with you.”"
0,“Thank you.” 
0,"Although Ceil desired revenge against the humans--no, Tolmyur, she had to remind herself--she doubted she could lead the scattered remnants of those still loyal to restore the Amelian Empire."
1,"While Ceil explained to Chloe the answer to her question, Lemi was the first of the dryads to return."
0,"She carried a short bow strung over her back with the string, white like a root and growing from the tips of the bow, taut across her chest."
0,Lemi’s preparation was likely to grow the bow.
0,“Are you a shaman?” Ceil asked.
0,“In training.
0,"I can use healing magic and dryadic magic,” Lemi replied with youthful confidence."
0,"Understanding her own limitations (and dangers) Ceil was grateful to finally have a healer accompany them, even if only temporarily."
0,"Behind Lemi, dryads approached one by one carrying bags made from woven leaves or roots, bundles of plant-like fabric, parcels of medicine, and more."
0,"The amount was excessive, and she worried about Chloe and Sammy who would have to carry it despite the constant strain of their heavy bodies."
0,"“This is too much,” Ceil said to stop the procession."
0,“We provide what we can.
0,"Take only what you need,” Hemma replied."
0,Ceil joined Sammy to inspect the supplies while Chloe stayed back to hold the infant.
0,"The large sacks contained herbs, mushrooms, and other edibles."
0,They could both hunt and scavenge so large food stores would be excess weight.
0,"The bundles of pale-green fabric were incredibly light cloaks, and while dryads were not known for the quality of their plant-based textiles, they were well insulating and appeared able to repel water."
0,"They could use them as covering at night to relieve Chloe of her need to keep everyone warm, further saving on food stores."
0,"The medicine wrapped in leaves was a paste, and from the pungent smell, beiju was one of many herbal ingredients."
0,"It was far higher quality than what she or Sammy could create, and although they had Lemi, her accompaniment was only temporary."
0,The medicine would be of great value when Lemi left.
0,"In one final drawstring pouch, Ceil found a strange herb she had never seen before."
0,"Sammy looked over her shoulder and immediately grabbed it with excitement, running to Chloe."
0,“Chloe! Look!” 
0,She held the pouch gently to not crush the herb.
0,"When Chloe looked inside, she was also surprised but then moved the infant away as if the herb was dangerous."
0,“What is it?” Ceil asked.
0,“We landed in a patch of these when we came to Fiorrae.
0,"They give you a kind of boost when you inhale them,” Sammy explained."
0,“Boost?”
0,Sammy carefully removed a single spongey bead and pinched it under Ceil’s nose.
0,The powdery yet sweet aroma shot through Ceil’s sinuses and made her reel back.
0,"Her mild exhaustion from running back to the village was gone, and she began feeling restless, like she had to stand and move."
0,“We probably never would have reached that lake where we met you if we didn’t have these.”
0,"“Do not rely too heavily on deshalu,” Hemma warned having watched the exchange."
0,“It can be addicting.
0,Save it for emergencies when you must fight or flee.
0,"It is a very rare herb due to over-gathering, so you may have trouble finding more.”"
0,"While Ceil handed out the cloaks to everyone, one final dryad approached carrying three staffs."
0,"They were thinner than Ceil’s but the wood appeared a far higher quality, shaped into what could be used as either a walking staff or a weapon with the pommel on one end."
0,"Ceil retrieved one staff and checked its life capacity in the rare chance that it was superior to hers, having been crafted by a dryad, but as expected it was far weaker."
0,"The quality of the wood was the most important factor, no matter how skilled the crafter."
0,"She handed them out, and Lemi was the only one who rejected it."
0,Ceil found this odd for one who used dryadic magic but then realized that Lemi’s bow could function as a conduit all the same.
0,Each of the four members of Ceil’s party wore a cloak.
0,Sammy carried the deshalu and medicine.
0,A single sack of food was divided between Ceil and Chloe.
0,"Preparations were finished, and the party was ready to depart."
0,Hemma held Lemi by her cheeks and pressed their foreheads together.
0,“Do our village proud.”
0,"Lemi swelled with confidence and led Ceil, Sammy, and Chloe out of the village."
0,"Chapter 14
“The Hamadryad”
Byurk"
1,Byurk supervised as his men quickly set up their small camp.
0,"They had no tents or bed rolls, so the preparation was only to clear the ground, create a perimeter, and then build a fire."
0,"His thirty-two-elite worked with fervor, not one man out of line or slow in his performance despite having kept an advanced march for the fourth day since leaving that Melian village."
0,"The night was already half spent, and they would be marching again at sunrise, so perhaps the soldiers were only eager to finish camp preparations quickly to maximize their sleep."
0,"The days of swift march were taking their toll on his men, but Byurk trusted they would push through."
0,"During the Coastal Wars, Byurk had days when rest was impossible, something he continually reminded his men."
0,They would grow stronger in proportion to the trials they faced.
0,"Byurk stood as last watch, and the night passed uneventfully, same as all previous."
0,"No Melian would ever think to ambush his men at night, of that he was certain."
0,The Habha were another matter.
1,He woke his men at first light and rallied them to pick up camp and prepare to leave.
0,He was eager to depart because he was sure that he was close to the Melian capital.
0,"The previous day, they ran into multiple Melians, and even now there was one in the distance watching his soldiers prepare for departure despite there being no village immediately nearby."
0,"“How much longer until we reach the capital,” Byurk asked Tyree."
0,“I have told you before that we do not have a capital.
0,It is only a centrally located village.”
0,“The difference is negligible.
0,How long?”
0,“We will reach it before midday.
0,"But before we leave, come with me.”"
0,Byurk followed Tyree to where the man from the other world lay.
0,His eyes were open in small slits that lacked the energy to open fully.
0,"The barely visible pupils found Byurk, and the man spoke."
0,“Minum…”
0,"His voice was like a breathless whisper, and if Byurk was not standing over him, he would not have heard it."
0,Byurk had seen men close to death.
0,"He had watched men pass from injury, exhaustion, and starvation."
0,"He knew the many faces of men, and the face beneath him showed fear through an expression too exhausted for emotion."
0,"This otherworldly human knew Byurk was his enemy, and that knowledge was deeply engraved in his mind."
0,Such a mental scar would not be created from secondhand information no matter how weak-willed the person.
0,There were no minums in the forward party that was wiped out by the Habha.
0,"Given his otherworldly apparel, there was one possible explanation."
0,"Not long after Jethro began his campaign against the city in the other world, this human from that world appeared on Whinhlem."
0,This man might have fought Jethro and his soldiers and was now here aiding Jethro’s enemies.
0,Byurk wanted to communicate but was not fortunate enough to be taught the language of that world.
0,"The instructor Jethro captured never returned after he left with the Lurr to locate the princess, and there were few remaining at the palace who spoke English, none of whom were skilled enough to teach him while he was recovering from the failed assassination by the fairies."
0,"This human accompanied the emperor’s wife, so his only hope was that he spoke elven."
0,“Can you hear me?” 
0,The man’s eyes twitched so lightly that only a practiced eye would notice.
0,Byurk took the faint movement as confirmation.
0,“Do you understand me?” 
0,"There was no movement, but animosity slowly grew behind the blank expression."
0,"The man was waking, his consciousness returning stronger, but Byurk did not know if he could communicate."
0,“What is your name?”
0,"A reaction, although faint."
0,"The man understood his words or at least this phrase, but he was not answering."
0,"He slapped the man across the cheek, and the Melian shaman startled at the sudden brutality, but she did not stop him."
0,Byurk took this as confirmation that this level of abuse would not endanger the weakened man’s frail life.
0,He slapped him again.
0,"“What is your name,” Byurk repeated."
0,"“Captain Byurk, we are ready to depart,” one of the soldiers informed him."
0,“Can you not see that I am busy?”
0,"“Sir, should we wait then?” "
0,"Byurk looked around and saw his men standing, waiting for instruction."
0,“Are you a bunch of recruits?” he hollered.
0,"“No sir,” the soldiers replied in unison."
0,“Then think for yourselves!
0,There are Melians passing through the area.
0,Question them about the hamadryad!” 
0,The men spread out.
0,“Stay within earshot and remember to be polite!
0,We are not their enemies!
0,Understood?!”
0,"“““Yes, sir!”””"
0,"Being so close to a central town, the last thing Byurk wanted was to insult the Melians, especially when Tolmyur desperately needed the aid of the dryads now that the other world had sided with the wife of the emperor."
0,“Your name!” 
0,"He swung his hand again, but when it was about to impact the man’s cheek, he felt a distortion."
0,Only Byurk’s fingertips grazed the man’s cheek as he turned his head to avoid that slap.
0,"The man used magic, but the ven Byurk felt had a signature that he did not recognize."
0,"He knew what spatial magic felt like, but this was different."
0,"The only other affinities that produced such distortions were time or gravity, and given the situation, there was only one possibility."
0,“Who are you?”
0,Byurk’s voice lost its authoritative tone.
0,This man was not some soldier or guard assigned to protect the wife of the emperor.
0,"This was a time mage, a human time mage, and one who could ignore channeling time."
0,"Time was an incredibly rare affinity for magically adept races to possess, even his fellow minums."
0,"The last time Byurk felt such shock was when he met Jethro for the first time, and the more he thought about it, the more he realized they were similar."
0,They both were unnaturally heavy.
0,They both had incredibly rare affinities for humans.
0,"Most importantly, this man came from another world, just like Jethro, a secret only known to a select few."
0,The amount of knowledge and power that Jethro possessed had drastically improved Tolmyur.
0,"Jethro had conquered their enemy, the Amelian Empire, after only a year of planning and at the cost of only a minute fraction of their army."
0,"If this man could do the same, he was the greatest danger to the Tolmyur Kingdom, greater even than the widow of the emperor or the princess."
0,"Byurk drew his sword, and before the dryad could stop him, he thrust it into the heart of the man, except it stopped after barely piercing the skin."
0,"He applied more force to the blade, but it would not move."
0,He felt the same odd signature.
0,The man’s magic rendered the blade immobile.
0,"Byurk looked at the man’s face and found it frozen, like death, except the man was very much alive."
0,He was only not moving.
0,Byurk tried to remove the sword but couldn’t.
0,He let go and stepped back.
0,The blade remained erect as if impaled in stone until slowly the blade tipped over.
0,"When it left the man’s skin, it fell to the ground as if gravity had grabbed hold of it once more."
0,Byurk immediately understood it was not gravity that grabbed hold of the blade.
0,It was time.
0,"The time of the blade had stopped, or nearly stopped, the moment it pierced him."
0,"Just as Byurk could never defeat Jethro in a duel, he would not be able to kill this man, at least if the man was awake."
0,"“Tyree, make him sleep,” Byurk ordered as he retrieved his sword."
0,“I forbid you from harming him any worse than you have.” 
0,The dryad’s dark green eyes glared at Byurk like a mother protecting her young.
0,"“He is my patient, and I will protect his life to my death, same as the soldiers I healed for your armies."
0,"If you want my cooperation, you will not kill him.”"
0,“Do you have any idea the danger this man poses?” 
0,“Danger to you or danger to us?” 
0,“I could kill you now and request any of the passing dryads to guide us.” 
0,Tyree’s face grew stern.
0,“I am one of the strongest shamans in all of Melia.
0,"In a forest, you would die before you touch me."
0,I will take you to the hamadryad as promised.
0,"If she chooses to support you and your cause, and if you still desire his death, I will not stop you."
0,"Until then, he is under my protection.”"
0,"Byurk sized up the dryad who, while kneeling, was still taller than him."
0,"He knew now that the village had sided with the emperor’s widow, but there was no deception in her eyes."
0,"Hamadryads were the highest authority in Dhuillir, and this shaman respected that authority."
0,“Fine.
0,"I will trust you to uphold your promise, but remember the message that was brought to your village."
0,"Siding with the widow of the emperor and those with her will bring the wrath of our Commanding General upon your people, like the fairies of Vallen."
0,"The Melians are too kind for such conflict, so know that my actions here are for the safety and benefit of your people.”"
0,"“Then you had best convince the hamadryad,” Tyree said, unperturbed."
1,Byurk sheathed his sword and walked back to the center of the small camp while Tyree rushed to heal the bleeding wound in the man’s chest and force him to sleep once more.
0,“Men!
0,Form up!
0,We march for the city!”
0,"The soldiers gathered quickly, and the march continued while Byurk had his men relay what they learned from passing dryads."
0,"He expected little in such a short time, and little was all they found."
0,"Only four dryads were questioned, and of those four, only two spoke Elven and gave conflicting information."
0,“The one who walks is in the village.”
0,“I think the hamadryad has moved on.” 
0,"The hamadryad either is or was in the village, confirming to Byurk that Tyree was not leading them astray, and that was the most valuable piece of information he needed."
1,They reached the city by midmorning.
0,"In Byurk’s march to Vallen, he had passed through many dryad villages but none this large."
0,It reminded him of a smaller forest city in Vallen with its structures grown from shrubs or carved out of trees.
0,"These structures were not for the Melians but were used to accommodate the non-dryad inhabitants, although it seemed that a few Melians resided in them."
0,A pair of Forest Elf men walked the street with crown-like antlers around their heads and their long tails swaying behind them.
0,A High Elf child bartered fruit with an older Melian while the child’s mother stood and watched.
0,"Unlike the smaller villages that dotted Melia, most the Melians of the city were clothed with skirts about their waists out of respect for those among the inhabitants who were not accustomed to nakedness."
0,"“Where will we find the hamadryad,” Byurk asked Tyree."
0,“We should seek out the village’s matriarch.
0,Follow me.”
0,"Tyree led Byurk’s party through the wide streets of the village, or what could have been considered streets: gaps between buildings where the grass was a little more trodden."
0,"The residents of the town kept their distance, and those who were in the middle of conversations or bartering grew silent when Byurk and his men passed."
0,"The Melians bowed lightly to the soldiers, but the few other residents, elves, nymphs, and other dryads glared with animosity."
1,"A short, stout tree not unlike those in Vallen grew near the center of the village."
0,One side had been hollowed out to create a wide entrance that could fit all thirty-two of Byurk’s men.
0,"Only two Melians resided in the hollow, a younger dryad and the village matriarch whom she served."
0,The matriarch sat cross-legged on a slightly elevated platform covered in moss with a dark green fabric over her lap.
0,She appeared some age between Tyree and the matriarch of Tyree’s village.
0,"Her wrinkled cheeks smiled as she bowed, welcoming her visitors."
0,“I am honored to be host to a commander of Tolmyur.” 
0,"The matriarch waved her hand, and her aid quickly retrieved two moss pads for Byurk and Tyree to sit on."
0,“Your men look weary.
0,"While we speak, may I offer services for them?"
0,"We have women, food, and drink."
0,I can also arrange entertainment.”
0,“I am grateful for your hospitality.
0,"If you can restore their energy, that alone will be sufficient.”"
0,Byurk looked back briefly at the famished faces of his men.
0,"“And some food, but make it light."
0,"Depending on our conversation, we may stay longer."
0,We will partake of your full hospitality then.”
0,“Of course.
0,"Seiva, gather some shamans and see that his men are fed and rested.”"
0,"The men tried to remain professional, but excitement or relief broke the surface on a few."
0,"After their strenuous march, Byurk could not find the will to chastise them."
0,Their rest and morale would help expedite their search for the hamadryad.
0,"The soldiers followed the aid out of the room, and Byurk sat alone with Tyree and the matriarch."
0,The only other occupant was the bound man sitting against the wall near the entrance.
0,"In order to best gauge the time he had, Byurk asked the most important question first."
0,“We came seeking audience with the hamadryad.
0,Is she in your village?”
0,The matriarch bowed her head apologetically.
0,"“Forgive my impudence, but before I answer your question, I must first know your reason."
0,Tolmyur killed our three Grandmatriarchs.
0,"I can only assume that if you knew of her during the assassinations, she would have been targeted as well."
0,"Hamadryads are vital in unifying the sixteen tribes, and now that we have lost that leadership, I must prioritize the safety of our current Grandmatriarch candidate.”"
0,Byurk nodded.
0,“Raise your head.
0,I take no offense to your precaution.
0,I also seek the unification of Dhuillir.”
0,The matriarch raised her head and looked into Byurk’s eyes to assess the truth of his statement.
0,"After a moment of pensive silence, she asked the vital question."
0,“Why?”
0,Byurk understood her reluctance to believe him.
0,The matriarch who first informed him of the hamadryad also feared he would seek the hamadryad’s destruction.
0,"She needed proof of his motives, and that very proof was in this room."
0,"“Tyree, bring the man here.” "
0,"While Tyree carried out Byurk’s orders, he continued addressing the matriarch."
0,“Are you skilled in life magic?”
0,“I am.
0,I was a shaman before accepting my role as matriarch of this village.”
0,Tyree laid the unconscious man between Byurk and the matriarch.
0,“This man is the reason.
0,I want you to scan both me and him and notice the differences.”
0,The matriarch was confused by the request but touched Byurk’s outstretched hand.
0,He felt the pulse of life magic surge through his body.
0,"She then touched the forehead of the man in front of her, and her eyes widened."
0,“What did you find?” he asked.
0,The matriarch traded glances between Byurk and the man.
0,"“The only difference between a minum and human should be your size, but this man, is he human?”"
0,"Byurk felt reservations revealing classified information to a former enemy, but the situation called for a breach of protocol, and he was willing to receive any punishment that would follow if the classified information spread."
0,"“He is human, but not of our world, not of Whinhlem."
0,"His kind poses a major threat, and we do not know how many of them are in Dhuillir, the former Amelian Empire, and Whinhlem."
0,I seek the unification of Dhuillir so that we may gain a strong ally against them.”
0,The matriarch licked her lips and was about to speak but fell silent.
0,"What Byurk told her was impossible to believe, at least if the truth was not in front of her."
0,She turned to Tyree for confirmation.
0,“Are there more of these humans?”
0,“There are two others that I know of who are different from the humans of Tolmyur.
0,I do not know if there are more of them or if they came from another world.”
0,"Byurk could only trust that Tyree’s reply was truthful, that she did not lie due to her village allying with the widow of the emperor."
0,"In the least, her answer was sufficient for Byurk to press the matriarch further."
0,“I must express the gravity of the danger each of these individuals pose.
0,This man before you is a time mage.
0,Another of his companions is a fire mage with an aptitude that surpasses any minum.
0,All we know about their goal is that they seek to create further conflict.” 
0,"Byurk placed both of his hands on the carved wooden floor and bowed his head to the matriarch, stunning her."
0,"“Please, I must speak with the hamadryad.”"
1,"Byurk and eight of his fastest men sprinted through the forest with Seiva, the matriarch’s aid, acting as a guide."
0,"Using his earth magic to kick up the ground and boost each step, Byurk kept pace with the sprint despite his small stature."
0,"The hamadryad had left the city two days prior, and Byurk thought that they would need to continue the march, but the matriarch assured that the hamadryad could not have traveled far and must yet be close to the village."
0,Her information came with ill news.
0,The hamadryad was weak and would likely not survive her trek to the next village.
0,“Commander Byurk!
0,Look here!” 
0,Seiva with her seemingly unlimited stamina ran a full fifty paces ahead of the group.
0,She stopped at what Byurk thought was a thin withered stump sticking out of the ground.
0,"When Byurk approached, he realized that he had been terribly mistaken."
0,It was a brown leg with a hint of orange showing between the bark-like wrinkles of the skin.
0,"The leg snapped off just below the knee, and small dead roots attached it to the ground."
0,“Increase your pace!
0,She should be close!”
1,"Almost an hour later, Seiva called back, “I see them!”"
0,In the distance were three dryads.
0,The one on the left was a Melian.
0,The other two dryads had a faint orange tint to their brown skin with thick and scaly fans of needle-like hair drooping halfway down their backs.
0,The dryad in the center had one hand each on the shoulders of the two dryads beside her for support as she hopped forward on her single foot.
0,"When the three dryads heard Seiva’s shout and approach, the hamadryad stopped moving but lacked the energy to turn around."
0,Seiva reached them far ahead of Byurk and his men.
0,The hamadryad requested Seiva’s aid as she and the other two dryads helped turn her to face him.
0,The withered body shocked him.
0,"Tyree compared the otherworldly human to a living corpse, but the single word that came to Byurk’s mind when looking upon the sunken and heavily cracking features of the Hamadryad was death."
0,She looked like the dried corpses he had seen when visiting villages that had fallen to famine in the mountainous deserts of western Tolmyur.
0,"“You wish to speak with me, young one?”"
0,"Her voice was like grinding sand, and Byurk’s throat itched at the sound."
0,"While Byurk collected his thoughts, the dryad of similar species to the hamadryad stared down at him with the sharp beauty of a fit adult woman."
0,She was either the hamadryad’s caretaker or bodyguard.
0,He did not doubt she was well practiced in combat.
0,"“Speak fast,” the woman ordered."
0,"“The longer she stands idle, the more she will take root.”"
0,Byurk saw the hamadryad’s last foot growing roots before his very eyes.
0,“Tearing the roots is as painful as peeling off your own skin.
0,Speak.” 
0,The glare of the unknown dryad demanded Byurk’s haste.
0,“What I must say is of grave importance but cannot be explained quickly.
0,Can you lift her so her foot does not touch?”
0,“The roots follow the path of life to where it connects to the soil.
0,"If we lift her, she will take root in us or you or whoever holds her.”"
0,"“Then if life cannot find its path, will she be safe?” "
0,"The Melian and the caretaker looked at each other, confused by Byurk’s question."
0,“Men!
0,Your swords and armor!” 
0,Byurk turned to the caretaker.
0,“Please walk her while I work.
0,I will not be long.”
0,"While the dryads helped the hamadryad take small, painful steps, Byurk used his earth magic to dull the edges of the swords."
0,The thin chain-link shirts lacked leather or other biological material.
0,"After fastening the handles together with fabric, he slipped the swords through the mail to create a small metal palanquin."
0,He then ordered two of his men to lift it on their shoulders.
0,“Place her here.”
0,The caretaker looked at the haphazard contraption with skepticism but did as she was asked.
0,The soldiers took extra care not to touch the hamadryad as she rested into the hanging chainmail.
0,"Small roots spouted from her legs and arms as she supported herself, but once they latched onto the metal, they stopped growing."
0,The path to the soil had been severed.
0,"“Incredible,” the elderly Melian said while circling the palanquin in dumbstruck amazement."
0,“I wish to take you back to the village to speak with you at length.
0,Do you feel you can manage this now?”
0,The hamadryad looked at the dull blades and chainmail.
0,"She could not move from her roots, but she was content."
0,"“Yes, I will gladly accompany you.”"
0,"Chapter 15
“Otherworldly Power”"
1,The sun in the late afternoon sky cast the shadow of large wings across the verdant expanse.
0,Coby soared at incredible speed from the wind expelled by his wings.
0,"His large round eyes moved erratically, his piercing vision glancing into every gap between every tree, visible for not even a moment, in search of the one who saved and treated him."
0,He had located the one she cared for and who was taken away by the human soldiers.
0,He saw many dryads but none that he recognized.
0,He saw many animals but had no time to hunt.
0,He only sought that one person.
1,"* * *
Sammy fought through the exhaustion of their chase."
0,Lemi guided their sprint towards the fifth Melian village on the pilgrimage’s path.
0,"By Hemma’s estimate, the hamadryad would have left Melia’s largest central village by the time they reached it, so their aim was for the city that followed."
0,They had traveled since before sunup at Sammy’s request and only took the briefest of breaks to snack on the food in Ceil and Chloe’s packs for energy.
0,"Sleep-deprived and both lungs and legs burning, Sammy forced herself onward with a single thought driving her."
0,"“Justin, please be okay.”"
0,"The branches of the trees snapped, and a cobalt blue blur dropped between Sammy and Chloe who was only a few paces ahead."
0,"Sammy had no time to register what happened before large talons grabbed her shoulders, and she shot up into the air with a flap of large wings."
0,But she did not stay there.
0,The large bird managed two strenuous flaps before falling with Sammy back below the canopy and to the forest floor.
0,"Sammy landed on her back with air erupting from her lungs, and her would-be captor rolled and fluttered on the ground in a ball of blue feathers."
0,"He righted himself and shook his plumage, gawking at Sammy with a cry of frustration while feathers floated to the ground around him."
0,“Coby!
0,You need to stop suddenly grabbing people.” 
0,"Ceil ran over to Sammy to help her up, and Lemi used life magic to heal Sammy’s scratches and ease her breathing."
0,"“Coby?” Sammy looked at the bird with tearful eyes, both from the painful impact and from seeing the companion she thought had left after he was healed."
0,"She broke away from the care of Ceil and Lemi and tackled the large, flustered hawk to the ground."
0,“I’m so happy to see you.” 
0,"She wrapped her arms around his neck in a tight embrace, and Coby did not protest or attempt to break free from her grasp."
0,"“Get off him,” Ceil ordered while pulling back on Sammy’s shoulder."
0,"“If Coby grabbed you, there is something he needs to show you."
0,The same happened to me when he discovered the soldiers were approaching Lemi’s village.
0,"He would be carrying you off somewhere if you were not so heavy,” Ceil said while straining from Sammy’s weight as she tried to pry her off Coby."
0,“Take me somewhere?” 
0,Sammy released her hold on Coby and stepped back.
0,Coby righted himself with a light flap of his large wings.
0,"“Kree!” He hopped and trotted away into the forest, crying again when no one followed him."
0,He returned to Sammy and pulled on her hair with his beak.
0,“Wait! Stop!” 
0,"Sammy pried her hair free from his beak, making him cry out even louder."
0,"“Lemi, what’s in that direction,” Ceil asked."
0,"Lemi thought for a moment, and her eyes lit up when the answer came."
0,“The central village is that way!
0,We are close to it right now.”
0,"“Coby wants us to go to another village,” Ceil explained to Sammy."
0,"“Do you think the hamadryad is there,” Lemi asked."
0,“Coby would not know we are seeking the hamadryad.
0,There has to be another reason.” Ceil turned to Sammy.
0,“Can you think of what Coby wants?”
0,Sammy looked into Coby’s deep black pupils.
0,An anxiety surfaced in her heart.
0,"“Justin,” she whispered under her breath."
0,“Justin.
0,Coby found Justin!”
0,"“If that is true, that is where we are headed.” Ceil turned to Lemi."
0,“How long until we reach the central village?”
0,"“If we do not stop, maybe late evening,” Lemi said."
0,"“Sammy, Justin might be at the central Melian village,” Ceil explained."
0,"The news gave Sammy her second wind, and she ran in the direction Coby had tried to pull her."
0,"Coby flew into the air with a profound cry and led Sammy onward with Chloe, Ceil, and Lemi quickly catching up."
1,"The group kept up the fastest pace that Chloe and Sammy could manage, and Lemi used her life magic to ease muscle fatigue when possible, but they were force to take a break when Sammy nearly collapsed."
0,"After a two-hour nap, they set off again at a slower pace."
0,"Well past midnight, Coby’s cries ceased."
0,"He flew silently in the night sky camouflaged in the darkness, but they no longer needed him as a guide."
0,Lemi knew where they were and that the central village was nearby.m
1,"After another hour, faint light appeared deep in the forest."
0,"It was subdued, only to allow visibility for the races that needed it in the dark nights."
0,The faint green beacon came from the top of a thick tree growing in the center of the forest clearing.
0,"Small structures surrounded it on all sides, and all was silent in the sleepy night."
0,"Coby landed on a branch at the edge of the clearing and silently flapped his wings, symbolizing that they had reached the destination he desired."
0,"“Where is Justin,” Sammy asked, leaning on a tree for support."
0,“Entering the village is too dangerous.
0,"If Justin is here, so are the soldiers.” "
0,Ceil turned to Lemi.
0,“Can you scout out the village for us?
0,They should not notice one more dryad.”
0,Lemi looked eager but concerned.
0,“Anthousai normally cannot leave their village.
0,I would attract the villagers’ attention because I am not from this village.”
0,“I am not worried about the dryads.
0,"I did not know anthousai are supposed to stay in their village, so I doubt the soldiers know."
0,"If Sammy or Chloe or I go, we would attract the soldiers’ attention."
0,It must be you.”
0,Lemi nodded eagerly and removed her cloak.
0,"She turned it on its side, folded it in half, and tied it about her waist like a skirt before readying her bow."
0,"Ceil, Sammy, and Chloe looked at the weapon, curious how she could use it without ammunition, but once Lemi had her hand on both the grip and string, a straight branch grew from above the grip until it extended to the string and out forward from the bow."
0,Leaves sprouted for fletching where the natural arrow nocked to the string.
0,Ceil was amazed.
0,"So long as Lemi nourished the life in the bow, she would have arrows."
0,Lemi ran low to the ground into the village without even the faintest sound to her step.
0,"Ceil was taught that in times of war, dryads were lauded for their stealth, but here she saw a dryad’s skill firsthand."
0,"Lemi was much older than Ceil, but mentally she was still an immature girl."
0,"Lemi’s single arrow was probably for protection in case of an emergency, but Ceil hoped she would not do anything rash."
1,She waited anxiously with Sammy.
0,"Chloe and Coby alone remained composed, but while Chloe waited patiently, Coby was scanning the village from his high perch for any sign of threat, and his silent trill signaled Lemi’s return."
0,She was not alone.
0,Another Melian followed Lemi silently out of the village.
0,She was elderly but did not appear quite as old as Hemma.
0,"When the two reached Ceil, Lemi introduced her."
0,"“This is Jenae, the matriarch of my village.”"
0,"“You went after the hamadryad,” Ceil said, realizing who might also be in the village."
0,Jenae nodded remorsefully.
0,"She bowed herself to the ground before Ceil, and Ceil knew what Jenae was about to say."
0,"After all, Hemma acted the same way after seeing her again."
0,"“I am terribly sorry, your Highness."
0,I have failed you.”
0,“I have no time for apologies.
0,Get up.
0,What happened in your village is in the past.
0,I hold no ill will.”
0,Jenae bowed her head lower until it touched the forest floor.
0,"“No, I have failed in my mission."
0,The human commander has met with the hamadryad.
0,She has decided to side with him.”
0,The news came as a shock to Ceil.
0,What kind of coercion had he used?
0,What kind of threats?
0,"Although the news was disappointing, a more pressing matter hung on her mind, and Sammy’s anxious grip on Ceil’s arm was growing tight and painful."
0,“What of my companion?
0,Is he safe?” Ceil asked.
0,“He… he will likely be executed at sunrise.”
0,Ceil’s heartrate accelerated.
0,"She grabbed Jenae’s arm and lifted her, and although Ceil did not know what manner of expression she was showing, Janae viewed her with terror."
0,“Explain!”
0,“Tyree told me that Byurk fears your companion and tried to kill him.
0,She only stopped him by promising to execute him if the hamadryad sided with Tolmyur against your companions.
0,Tyree is loyal to the Grandmatriarchs.
0,She will follow through with the execution.”
0,“And the hamadryad has sided with them…” Ceil’s legs grew weak.
0,"She looked over at Sammy who begged in silence for good news, but a tear fell from Sammy’s eyes as the unspoken conversation of Ceil’s gaze told Sammy of ill fortune."
0,“What happened to Justin?” Sammy asked.
0,Ceil was about to explain Justin’s fate when she realized what Jenae had said.
0,"The dark sky was ever so slightly growing lighter, but morning was yet still far off."
0,She faced Jenae with all seriousness.
0,“You said at sunrise.
0,Justin is still alive.
0,Where is he?”
0,“He is in Tyree’s care in the soldier’s camp.
0,There are over thirty of them.
0,You cannot fight them.”
0,“We have an entire village of dryads here.
0,Can we not rally them?”
0,“And start a war against Tolmyur?
0,"You might be able to convince the outsiders to side with you, but the Melians will not willingly start a war."
0,We have already submitted to them.”
0,Ceil pulled Jenae up until their noses nearly touched.
0,“Justin’s death could spell disaster for us all.”
0,Moisture drained from Jenae’s face.
0,"Ceil released her grip, and Jenae sunk back away from her."
0,"Ceil paced, contemplating what she could do."
0,She could not fight the soldiers with so few on her side.
0,“Could Tyree be convinced to return Justin to us?”
0,Jenae kept her head bowed to the ground.
0,"“She has not heard of the hamadryad’s decision, so perhaps, but we would not be able to take your companion from the soldiers’ camp unnoticed."
0,Their commander will return to the hamadryad at first light to hear her decision.
0,Once he returns to camp--”
0,“Enough.” Ceil rustled her hair and groaned.
0,"“Tell me what’s going on,” Sammy pleaded, but Ceil kept thinking."
0,“My only option is to speak with the hamadryad.
0,Where is she?”
0,"“Inside the village matriarch’s abode, the large tree in the center of the village.”"
0,“And the soldiers’ camp?” 
0,“Not far separate from the abode.
0,The soldiers are in the care of this village and are using their structures.
0,"If you go to see the matriarch and hamadryad, you will be noticed.”"
0,"“Chloe, you are a powerful fire mage, correct?” Ceil asked."
0,"Chloe startled from the sudden, seemingly out of place question, having been unable to follow the Elven conversation."
0,“I don’t know if I am that powerful.
0,I have nothing to compare myself against.”
0,"“The attack you threw at the scout who saw my tails, that was your best fireball, correct?” "
0,Chloe thought for a moment.
0,“I could probably do one stronger than that if I tried.
0,"Yah, a lot stronger.”"
0,Ceil’s eyes grew wide.
0,"The fireball from back then was master-class, and if Chloe could produce one stronger, then she was in a class all her own."
0,Maybe we can fight them… but what of the village?
0,"“Chloe, I need you to draw the soldiers out of the village.”"
0,“Me? On my own?” 
0,Ceil knew her request was dangerous.
0,"If Chloe could attack the soldiers directly, she could probably do a lot of damage, but Justin was in the camp."
0,Her only choice was to have them chase Chloe out of the village.
0,“You are right.
0,That will not work.”
0,Ceil forgot that Chloe was not the same as her.
0,"Even though Chloe was stronger than Sammy, they shared the same condition."
0,Chloe was heavy and slow.
0,The soldiers would catch her quickly.
0,"Even if she could move quickly, possibly with the help of the deshalu grass, the number of soldiers was a major concern for a single person; however, she did have someone who was faster and very capable in a fight."
0,“I know what we can do.”
0,Ceil gathered everyone together to explain her plan.
1,"* * *
Chloe hurried with a spring in her step through the forest circling the village."
0,She felt light.
0,"Her accelerated heartrate made her body throb, and she loved the feeling."
0,"Lemi ran a few paces in front of her, guiding her into position."
0,"She coaxed Chloe on with silent words that Chloe could not understand, but so long as she kept pace, they would arrive in time, or at least she hoped."
0,The one to initiate the plan could not be conversed with but seemed intelligent enough to reason through the commands and gestures given.
0,"Ceil had a lot of trust in Coby, but Chloe still had doubts."
0,"Even if Coby had understood and executed the two orders Ceil had given him in the past, that did not mean he would be able to follow complicated instructions."
0,"Chloe felt that in order to comprehend such an order without even knowing the language of the one giving it would take human-level intelligence, and even then it would be difficult."
0,She doubted a bird would be able to understand.
0,Lemi stopped at the edge of the forest and pointed to the ground after speaking a few words.
0,She then readied her bow and ran silently into the village.
0,"Chloe was left alone, anxiously waiting for the start of the operation while her mind focused on the mildly sweet aroma lingering in her sinuses."
0,"She scanned the village for any sign of disturbance, but it remained peaceful."
0,"Everything relied on Coby, and Ceil gave no alternative if Coby failed."
0,Large dark wings flapped silently in the sky.
0,Chloe’s eyes followed Coby until he landed atop the stout tree in the center of the village.
0,Coby was visible in the faint glow.
0,His head scanned the edge of the village and stopped when facing Chloe.
0,"She could not be sure, but she felt that Coby was staring directly at her."
0,"He spotted her in the dark, which felt odd because she thought she read somewhere that hawks had bad night vision, but then again, this was a different world, and the knowledge she had of the animals on Earth might not apply to those on Whinhlem."
0,"Coby flapped his large wings, shaking and breaking the thin branches at the top of the tree."
0,"Faint voices could be heard, and in the next instant, it started."
1,"* * *
Byurk woke to the murmuring of his men and the sound of snapping wood."
0,“What is that racket?” 
0,He peeled off his woven grass blanket and sat up on his small moss bed.
0,The soldiers beside him who also were sleeping grew attentive quickly and looked around to assess what was happening.
0,The soldiers outside the small grass hut were in a panic.
0,"Training and experience kicked in, and Byurk’s men immediately retrieved their weapons."
0,“What is going on!?”
0,"Hearing Byurk’s shout, one of the soldiers at the entrance of the hut finally answered."
0,“That Habha has returned!”
0,It couldn’t be… “The wife has found us!
0,All men to--”
0,A large blade of wind cut down through the thatch roof and side wall.
0,The hut collapsed on top of Byurk and those inside.
0,The sharp grass scratched his face and hands as he scrambled to break through the reeds intertwined tightly together by their roots.
0,The scene outside as he broke through the natural roofing was chaos.
0,His men were armed and looking to the sky.
0,Those with bows had arrows knocked and waiting.
0,Two fire mages had fireballs ready but hesitated to throw them.
0,Everything in the village was wood.
0,"Everything was plant matter, even the residents."
0,Fire was too dangerous to use inside the village.
0,Dryad life sap was particularly flammable.
0,That hesitation proved fatal as one of the mages was cut down by a blade of wind before Byurk’s eyes.
0,"The hut beside him took most of the blow, collapsing the wall."
0,That hut was not being used by his men.
0,The three Melians inside screamed and rushed out of the entrance on the other side.
0,The Melians viewed the large bird with terror.
0,Even they feared the Habha.
0,“Drive that buzzard from the village!
0,Protect the villagers!” 
0,Rage burned within him.
0,The wife of the emperor was attacking the village of her own former subjects.
0,“Drive it away!” 
0,Byurk scrambled over the thatch roof and ran to the three Melians cowering beside their partially destroyed hut.
0,He urged them to flee with a push on their backs.
0,"Once they began moving, other cowering Melians followed them in their flight, all except one."
1,"A young Melian with so many white flowers in her mossy hair that it looked like matted cotton ran crouched towards the chaos, stopping near the village matriarch’s tree."
0,"Something about the girl felt strangely familiar, but his suspicions disappeared when she peered into the sky with bow and arrow in hand."
0,"Byurk was proud to see a Melian brave enough to confront the Habha, especially a child, but he could not allow such a young girl to endanger herself."
0,"He ran towards her, causing her to fright."
0,“This is no place for a child!
0,Leave!”
0,The girl looked into his eyes with trepidation.
0,She shook her head.
0,"“No, I need to…”"
0,"Byurk’s own men, a hand selected group of elite soldiers, could only manage to drive the Habha away in past attacks."
0,What could a child do against it?
0,"“Your bravery is commendable, but you cannot fight it.” "
0,"Despite his words, the girl would not listen."
0,Her bravery was inspiring.
0,“Fire your one arrow and then flee.”
0,The girl looked at him and then at the Habha.
0,"Now confronted with the task before her, she grew fearful."
0,“Shoot or I will drag you away myself!”
0,The girl drew the string and took aim with shaking arms.
0,"The released arrow flew with a wide arch, and although Byurk expected little from a child, the arrow missed its mark to a surprising degree."
0,"However, unlike the arrows of his archers, the Habha paid special attention to it and dove far to the left to avoid it despite the arrow having no chance of hitting."
0,The bird flapped wildly in a fluster and turned from its attack.
0,"It left for the clearing between the village and forest, and his soldiers made chase."
0,Byurk turned to the girl in amazement.
0,“Be proud.
0,You have just saved your village.
0,Now go!” 
0,He forcefully turned the girl and pushed her in the opposite direction with a single shove.
0,The girl did as instructed and ran out of sight to the other side of the matriarch’s tree.
1,Byurk now had a moment to think.
0,"If the Habha was attacking, then the wife of the emperor was near or already in the village."
0,"There were two reasons she would be there, to retrieve her companion or to see the hamadryad."
0,"If she was attacking the village, then the possibility of her culling favor with the hamadryad was low, so the most plausible reason was her companion."
0,"He was her goal, assuredly."
0,The otherworldly humans had enough power that the wife would not need the aid of the dryads.
0,"The dryads meant nothing to her, and that was why she was willing to sacrifice them to attack his men and rescue her companion."
1,"Byurk ran to the small hut next to his, where Tyree cared for the otherworlder."
0,"Inside, both she and the Melian who was traveling with the hamadryad huddled together next to the otherworlder."
0,“The wife of the emperor has come for him.
0,"If you wake him, can he walk?”"
0,Tyree looked at Byurk as if he was a fool.
0,"“I do not know how long he has been in this condition, but his muscles are atrophied."
0,He will not be able to walk with the weight of his body.”
0,“Can you not use life magic to help or force him to walk?
0,We need to leave here.”
0,"“I am a Melian, not a kissiae.”"
0,“Then you must carry him.
0,My men are fighting the Habha and are unable to assist.” 
0,Byurk turned to the other Melian.
0,"“Jenae was your name, if I recall."
0,"I know you are elderly, but can you help her?"
0,I will reward you however I am able.”
0,Jenae looked at the man and then at Tyree.
0,"After a moment of hesitation that almost forced Byurk to plead further, she agreed."
0,“I will do what I can.”
0,"“I apologize for leaving labor to the elderly, but I cannot help with my stature."
0,"I am unskilled with ranged magic, but I can protect you from the Habhah as you flee.”"
0,Byurk left the hut with the two Melians close behind.
0,"One arm of the man hung around each of their shoulders, and their aged bodies hunched forward under his weight as his feet dragged on the ground."
1,Byurk followed the last of his straggling men through the village.
0,The Habha finally reached the clearing where none of the villagers would be harmed in the fight.
0,"When Byurk reached the edge of the village, a dark orange glow grew in the forest."
0,"The moment the Habha saw it, it shot up far into the sky with three frantic flaps and disappeared into the dark."
0,"He knew who hid in the forest, the powerful fire mage accompanying the wife."
0,“We’ve been had.
0,Everyone scatter!” Byurk hollered.
0,A massive fireball like glowing orange mud spat out flames as it traveled towards his men.
0,Byurk could only watch as his two earth mages set up thick walls of earth in desperation when the ball hit.
0,The erupting flame blew Byurk to his back and left a painful ringing in his ears.
0,"Viscous fire rained on the clearing, each drop continuing the cacophony of destruction with smaller explosions."
0,Many of the huts at the edge of the village were not spared from the devastation.
0,"Fire clung to the ground, burning the very soil."
0,"Resting on his elbow, Byurk watched the sea of fire and the living torches that were once his men quickly collapsing into the flames."
0,"He had been involved in battles against the Goblins, Sirens, and Merfolk in defense of Tolmyur."
0,"He had seen ships sunk, armies massacred, and villages destroyed."
0,"He had stood face to face with dragons, but for the first time in his nearly five years of life, he felt true terror."
0,Before him was the great and terrible power of a single human from the other world.
0,"Byurk turned to his stomach, his body aching from the force of the explosion."
0,His ears rang incessantly.
0,"Behind him, Tyree had her hand on the man’s chest, checking him for harm."
0,"For a moment Byurk considered returning the otherworlder to spare his men, but no."
0,"He thrust his palm onto the ground, and his ven traveled through the earth instantly below the otherworlder’s heart."
0,"If this otherworlder held such power as he just witnessed, especially being a time mage, then the sacrifice of he and his men would have purpose."
0,The formed spike never broke up through the soil.
0,"Roots quickly bound his hands and legs, and Tyree faced him in anger."
0,"“Where life is present, earth magic will always be inferior."
0,I gave my word to protect this man until the hamadryad’s decision is made.
0,You will not harm him.”
0,Veins bulged in Byurk’s head both from anger and the roots constricting his body.
0,“Are you blind?!
0,Can you not see the danger that even one of these invaders poses?!
0,Look around you!
0,The village of your fellow Melians burns as they cower in fear of those who fight for the wife of the former emperor!
0,These are not just Tolmyur’s enemies.
0,These are all our enemies!”
0,Jenae looked at the burning huts near her and the devastation of the field before her.
0,Byurk could see the hesitation in her eyes.
0,"“Jenae, if you care for your people, you must kill him.”"
0,"“I…” Jenae looked at the otherworlder, then at Tyree."
0,Her nervous glances switched back and forth between the stout tree in the center of the village and the unconscious man beside her.
0,"She was visibly troubled, and Byurk could not understand why with the evidence in front of her."
0,He had only one option.
0,"“While I confront the fire mage, go see the hamadryad!"
0,Demand her answer!” 
0,Jenae ran unsteadily back into the village.
0,"Byurk struggled to break free of his binds, but they held sound."
0,“Release me.
0,I am fighting for your people.
0,Surely you see this.”
0,"“You are fighting for your own interests,” Tyree retorted, “but do as you please.” "
0,"The roots withered and snapped like dry reeds, and Byurk pushed himself to his feet."
0,“I will hold you to your promise.
0,"If Jenae brings word in my favor, kill that man.” "
0,"Without so much of a glance back for Tyree’s acknowledgement, Byurk ran towards the inferno to rally the survivors against the fire mage."
1,"* * *
Sammy stood frozen gazing at the plume of fire rising above the huts from the explosion that could only have been caused by Chloe."
0,"The cry of fear sounded from all over the village, and if Sammy did not know the truth about what was happening, she would think this was an attack on the village."
0,“What are we doing?” she asked.
0,“Stop staring and move.” 
0,Ceil grabbed Sammy’s wrist and continued pulling her through the village towards the matriarch’s tree but stopped a few huts back.
0,They could not progress further without word that the tree was clear.
0,Dryads fled past them to get as far from the danger as possible.
0,Mothers were holding or pulling their crying children.
0,Youth assisted the elderly.
0,A pair of elves with small antlers circling their heads like a crown conversed with each other within earshot.
0,"She could not understand their conversation, and they soon ran towards the inferno."
0,"“Ceil, isn’t what we are doing a bit extreme?” Sammy asked."
0,"“We do not have much of a choice at this point,” Ceil growled over her shoulder."
0,"“Justin is important, is he not?”"
0,"While Sammy could not deny that her desire to have Justin returned to her was so strong that her heart physically ached, she also felt bad about the terror their methods were causing the innocent villagers."
0,"Lemi appeared from around the side of the hut, jumped when she spotted Ceil and Sammy, and ran towards them shouting."
0,"Ceil pulled Sammy forward between the huts to the large, stout tree."
1,"The remains of a large, collapsed grass hut lay in a heap beside the tree."
0,"Supplies and gear littered the ground, and Sammy realized that visiting the tree without being spotted would have been impossible."
0,The soldiers were camped right next to it.
0,"Ceil pulled Sammy behind Lemi into the wide entrance of the hollow, and Sammy immediately shrieked."
0,A palanquin created by binding six swords and some chainmail together sat atop four swords driven erect into the wood.
0,"Resting atop the palanquin was the terrifying form of a withered woman like all the moisture had been drained from her body, causing her skin to crack in long orange lines."
0,"Her sunken, hollow eyes followed Sammy, and Sammy could not prevent her body from shaking or tears from forming."
0,"“Show some respect,” Ceil whispered at Sammy, pushing her to kneel on the ground."
0,"Ceil only bowed her head briefly to the hamadryad, showing her status as an equal."
0,"“Who may you be, child,” spoke the village matriarch sitting on her low pedestal beside the hamadryad."
0,Ceil stood before the village matriarch with the dignified posture engrained in her by her caretakers in the palace.
0,"“I am Ceil, widow of Yuro Amel and Empress of the Amelian Empire.”"
0,The matriarch shifted to her knees with an air of elegance.
0,“I have received word from Jenae that you were in Melia.
0,"Forgive my rudeness, but I wish to confirm the truth of your identity."
0,Please extend your hand.”
0,Ceil did as asked.
0,"When the matriarch’s fingers touched hers, she released a pulse directed up her arm to her shoulder and then down her spine to her tails."
0,“Forgive me.” 
0,The matriarch shifted her legs forward and off her pedestal.
0,"Once kneeling on the wooden floor, she pressed her forehead down."
0,“I have no time for formalities.
0,I must speak with the--” Ceil began.
0,“Your highness!” 
0,Jenae stumbled through the entrance to the hollow in a panic.
0,"“The minum commander, he demands the hamadryad’s answer."
0,I… I did not know what to say.
0,Are you truly on our side?”
0,“What of Justin?” Ceil shouted back.
0,Jenae’s orders were to stay with Justin to make certain Tyree did not harm him.
0,"Hearing Justin’s name, Sammy sprung to her feet."
0,“What happened?
0,What happened to Justin?”
0,"“Stay back and keep quiet,” Ceil ordered, but Sammy grabbed Ceil’s arm in a painful grip."
0,“Don’t tell me to stay quiet!
0,Do you have any idea what it’s like not knowing what’s going on or what anyone is saying?
0,Please!
0,Tell me what happened.”
0,"“Everyone, be still.” "
0,"Sammy shrunk away from the course yet loud voice of the hamadryad, and Jenae immediately knelt with her forehead pressed to the floor."
0,"“Lady Ceil, widow of Yuro, I know why you are here."
0,"You may have only just been brought into the reign of Amel, but the time of Amel is over."
0,You must accept that the Amelian Empire has ended.
0,"In this conflict, I must prioritize the dryads."
0,I assume Jenae has informed you of my decision to join with Tolmyur.
0,The dryads can no longer support you.”
0,"Each word spoken by the Hamadryad reverberated in Ceil’s mind, and she felt so small in front of one who had lived for ages."
0,"Deep down, Ceil knew she was not an empress, even if the title had fallen upon her shoulders."
0,She could not use her false authority against the hamadryad even if the other dryads recognized it.
0,"“Jenae, you may inform young Byurk of my decision,” the Hamadryad ordered."
0,“As… as you will…”
0,“Stop! Please!”
0,Ceil ran to Jenae before she could finish standing.
0,“Wait. Please…” 
0,"Ceil’s regal demeanor vanished, and Jenae looked up at her shocked that one of Ceil’s standing would resort to pleading."
0,"“What is it you wish to say,” the hamadryad asked."
0,"Ceil’s shoulder’s shook, and anxiety grew in her chest."
0,She was not trying to rebuild her empire.
0,"There was something more, something greater that the hamadryad was unaware of."
0,Ceil’s maid had told her that she had a role in something to come.
0,That warning was repeated by the Sprite Arkhon.
0,The hamadryad was right.
0,The Amelian Empire fell.
0,"Once the fairies are defeated, the last opposition to Tolmyur would be extinguished."
0,They would win.
0,The current conflict was near its end.
0,"If so, what role did the Arkhon claim Ceil had?"
0,What role did Justin have?
0,Why was saving him so important if the war would soon end?
0,"“What do you know about the coming conflict,” Ceil asked quietly through quivering lips."
0,“Something is going to happen.
0,"I do not know what it is, but the sprites are preparing for it.” "
0,"She turned to face the hamadryad, unsure of her own words."
0,“Something is coming.
0,"I do not know what it is, but it is greater than me, greater than restoring the Amelian Empire.”"
0,The hamadryad closed her eyes in pensive thought.
0,"“Child, the Commander of Tolmyur spoke the same."
0,"He claims invaders with great power have come to Whinhlem from another world, invaders that you have taken as companions."
0,"I cannot see outside this room, but I can feel the hearts of all dryads who have accepted me."
0,The dryads in the village fear you and the invaders from the other world that you accompany.”
0,Ceil thought she misheard.
0,The hamadryad was mistaken.
0,Invaders from another world?
0,And those invaders were her companions?
0,A terrifying shiver shot down Ceil’s back.
0,"She turned to face Sammy who stood silently, awaiting any news of Justin."
0,The odd characteristics of Sammy and Chloe that even Tyree stated was not human.
0,Their strange conversations at night when they thought she was sleeping.
0,Their peculiar clothing.
0,"Their lack of the most common of knowledge, like beiju."
0,The gaps in Ceils mind that caused unease ever since the first day she met Sammy and Chloe atop the plateaus of Fiorrae were finally locking together.
0,“Sammy? Did you come from another world?”
0,"Ceil could not believe the words she was speaking, but the shocked expression on Sammy’s face hinted it might be true."
0,Ceil ran to her and clasped her shoulders.
0,“Tell me!
0,Did you come from another world?!
0,Are you not from Whinhlem?!”
0,"Sammy looked into Ceil’s panicked eyes, fearing how she would react if she answered truthfully."
0,Would Ceil abandon Justin?
0,Would she become her enemy?
0,"Over Ceil’s shoulder, the weight of the hamadryad’s hollow gaze bored into her soul."
0,The hamadryad already knew.
0,"Sammy was unsure how, but the hamadryad knew that she was not from Whinhlem."
0,Lying to Ceil now would be dangerous.
0,“I’m not from Whinhlem.
0,"Justin, Chloe, and I come from a planet called Earth.”"
0,"Ceil released her grip and tripped back, falling on her butt."
0,"“All this time, you were from another world?”"
0,“Why does being from another world even matter?
0,We were sent here by Eydis.
0,That much is true!”
0,"The hamadryad spoke in a grating but commanding tone, causing both Ceil and Sammy to shrink."
0,Ceil turned to the hamadryad and nodded before facing Sammy once more.
0,“The Hamadryad has already heard the Tolmyur commander’s story and now wants to hear yours.”
0,“Then tell her.
0,Everything I told you about what happened to us is true.”
0,“I want the whole truth!” Ceil shouted.
0,“Who are you?
0,Who are Chloe and Justin?
0,Why did Eydis choose Justin?
0,Why does the Sprite Arkhon acknowledge him?”
0,“It’s not just Justin.
0,Chloe is also important according to the Arkhon.
0,I’m the only one of us who isn’t… 
0,I’ll tell you everything.” 
1,"While Ceil translated for the hamadryad, Sammy recounted how she met Eydis and how she learned what happened the night of the Assassination."
0,"She explained how Eydis settled into life on Earth quickly, became an instructor at her university, taught them magic, and over time grew closer and closer to Justin."
0,"She explained how Eydis’s anxiety grew worse after Jethro’s men abducted her, how she taught them combat magic and worked with the police and military to protect the city."
0,"Eydis became hospitalized in an attack where they used an innocent elf girl as bait, and then Jethro invaded with an army."
0,The soldiers were willing to destroy the entire city to capture Eydis.
0,"When Sammy, Justin, and Chloe finally reached Eydis, Jethro was there."
0,"“And if it wasn’t for Eydis sending us to Whinhlem, Jethro would have killed us."
0,See?
0,Everything is the same as I told you.
0,Being from another world doesn’t change anything.”
0,"The hamadryad spoke, and Ceil translated the question for Sammy."
0,“Are there any more humans from your world here?”
0,“We were the only ones Eydis sent.
0,"I mean, Jethro can send people between worlds too, so I don’t know."
0,"Me, Justin, and Chloe are the only people from Earth that I know about.”"
0,“Are humans from your world planning to invade?” 
0,“I don’t know!
0,"If Eydis survived Jethro’s attack, maybe she would ask for their help.”"
0,"“Are you certain that the humans of your world would side with Eydis, or would they support Jethro.” "
0,“Support Jethro?” Sammy stomped towards the hamadryad.
0,"“Sammy, calm down,” Ceil whispered, but Sammy ignored her."
0,“Have you even been listening to me?!
0,Jethro attacked my city!
0,Tons of people died!
0,I don’t know if the city is even there anymore!
0,Of course we would not side with Jethro!
0,Is that head of yours hollow?!” 
0,"Ceil tried to pull Sammy away, but Sammy held fast using her weight to anchor herself."
0,“You cannot speak to a Hamadryad like that.
0,She is the same rank as the Sprite Arkhon.” 
0,"“Lemi, Help me.” "
0,“I don’t care.”
0,Sammy’s eyes never wavered.
0,She stared deep into the sunken gaze of the hamadryad.
0,"When Lemi grabbed Sammy’s other arm, they were able to pull Sammy away."
0,"“Tell her so that it can get through that shriveled head of hers,” Sammy ordered again, refusing to kneel back down."
0,“Tell her that we attacked this village because you abandoned Justin and let those soldiers take him.
0,Tell her that he’s going to die if she sides with those soldiers.
0,Tell her that I promised the Arkhon I would protect him!
0,Tell her!”
0,The hamadryad’s expression never changed.
0,"She watched the commotion with repose, and a single word froze Ceil in place."
0,"“You seriously want me to translate what you said,” Ceil asked Sammy in a fearful yet quiet voice."
0,"“Every single word,” Sammy replied, never breaking her glare at the hamadryad."
0,Ceil’s mind was in a panic.
0,She would have thought Sammy learned after what happened when she talked back to the Sprite Arkhon.
0,"Perhaps the concept of authority did not exist on Sammy’s world, but it was very important on Whinhlem."
0,"The rulers of highly organized societies inherited their thrones, but in much of the world, the leaders were the strongest, whether by the nature of the selection process or by rule of power."
0,"Dryadic magic grew stronger with age, and Ceil did not doubt that even in the hamadryad’s withered state, she could kill them easily if she desired."
0,"“Translate,” the hamadryad ordered again, and Ceil could not disobey out of fear of greater wrath than what Sammy’s insults alone would incur."
0,"“Please be open-minded,” Ceil pleaded."
0,“Sammy has little respect for authority and even spoke out against the Sprite Arkhon.” 
0,"After her small plea, Ceil repeated every word Sammy said, and Lemi, Jenae, and the village matriarch all bowed their faces to the ground in fear of the hamadryad’s wrath."
0,The only dryad in the room who did not become submissive was the hamadryad’s guard.
0,A wooden spear grew from the floor at her feet.
0,She snapped it off and marched towards Sammy.
0,"“Please, stop,” Ceil begged standing in front of Sammy who remained unperturbed."
0,The hamadryad tore her hand from the edge of the palanquin and raised it to stop her guard’s advance.
0,"“I requested the truth, and the child obeyed."
0,She has done no wrong.”
0,"The guard returned to her position behind the hamadryad, but the spear remained firmly grasped in her hand."
0,Lemi jumped up and embraced Sammy while Ceil sighed quietly in relief.
0,"“I commend honesty in any form,” the hamadryad continued."
0,"“This child speaks her truth as did that young commander, and yet both truths conflict."
0,"However, this child’s story has a weight that I cannot ignore."
0,"Lady Ceil, is it true that you are on errand from the Sprite Arkhon?”"
0,Ceil struggled to think of a clear answer.
0,"She was banished from Fiorrae because the Sprite Arkhon wanted her to accomplish her duty or fate, but he never explained the nature of her fate."
0,"The only person given a direct task was Sammy, and that task was to find help for Justin, a task that Ceil had played a detrimental role in."
0,"If the hamadryad had asked if she had the support of the Sprite Arkhon, then she felt she could answer in the affirmative, but she could not honestly say she was working on his behalf."
0,"“No, I am not on errand for him, but saving that man, Justin, is a task the Sprite Arkhon has given Sammy."""
0,"“If I side with the commander, then that man’s life is forfeit?” the hamadryad asked."
0,Ceil looked over to Jenae who quickly rose to kneel.
0,"“Yes,” she answered."
0,"“My village shaman, Tyree, will execute him on the commander’s order if the commander earns your favor."
0,She honors your word more than our village’s promise to Ceil.”
0,"“Lady Ceil, relay my words to Sammy."
0,Hamadryads pilgrimage to connect our hearts with our people before taking root and becoming a Grandmatriarch.
0,Failure to complete our pilgrimage means that our people are not connected under the same Grandmatriarch.
0,"To prevent this, a guard from the hamadryad’s village of birth is provided to protect the hamadryad or kill her if the hamadryad is incapable of completing the pilgrimage."
0,My decision to side with the young commander was to earn Tolmyur’s favor in my absence.
0,"As you were honest with me, I will be honest with you."
0,I cannot complete my pilgrimage.”
0,"The Melians in the room stared in shock at the news, and the hamadryad’s guard hung her head in remorse."
0,Sammy grabbed Ceil’s shoulder.
0,“She can’t complete her pilgrimage?
0,What does that mean for Justin?”
0,"“Becoming a Grandmatriarch was not my calling,” the hamadryad continued."
0,"“I was a mother of many, and by chance I lived long enough to also bear roots."
0,"My life is frail as you can see, and my body can no longer support itself."
0,"Even as I sit here, my body grows weak, and I will die unless I take root."
0,I will not last until the end of the pilgrimage.
0,"I cannot take your side, nor can I take the commander’s.”"
0,"“Then what about Justin,” Sammy cried after hearing Ceil’s translation."
0,“I promised to save him.
0,I cannot lose him…”
0,"“If the hamadryad does not take a side, what will Tyree do?"
0,"Will she return Justin to us,” Ceil asked Jenae."
0,"“She will continue to protect him,” Jenae assured Ceil, “but I doubt she will be able to safely return him."
0,The commander was desperate to kill even one of your companions.
0,He tried again after witnessing your companion’s magic.
0,I fear he will order his men to kill both Tyree and him if the hamadryad does not take his side.”
0,"When Ceil translated Jenae’s reply, Sammy broke down into tears."
0,"“So no matter what happens, Justin will be killed?” "
0,Sammy knelt before the palanquin and grasped the swords supporting the two corners.
0,"She bowed her head low, careful to not apply any strength to her hands or pull at the swords."
0,"The posture matched perfect Elven manner, surprising not only Ceil but also the hamadryad."
0,"Ceil never taught Sammy Elven mannerisms, so Sammy could only have learned this from Eydis."
0,She too knelt before the hamadryad.
0,“Can nothing be done?” Ceil asked.
0,“Hamadryads hold authority respective to their age.
0,"For this reason, the matriarchs are the eldest in each village."
0,Grandmatriarchs likewise are the eldest of all dryads and rule all of Dhuillir.
0,"Even before the death of our three Grandmatriarchs, there is one dryad, a kissiae, who is older than them all."
0,"And yet, even she is only an infant to the Sprite Arkhon."
0,Age is authority to us.
0,"Dryads are the longest living of the mortal races, but the Sprite Arkhon is from an ancient age before dryads."
0,"If his will is to save this Justin, then I am bound by duty to obey."
0,"Regrettably, I can do nothing as I am."
0,"If we were in Kedra, as the eldest of the Kedros, I could order my daughters to save Justin, but here in Melia I have no right to order these people to die.”"
0,“Did you not just say that age is authority?” Sammy asked.
0,“An ancient custom long forgotten after dryads joined under the Amelian banner.
0,Only the eldest of dryads still hold to that tradition.
0,"Here in Melia, I am a Grandmatriarch candidate."
0,Nothing more.”
0,"When Ceil translated the ill news, she expected Sammy to break down into a fit of crying or rave about in anger, but instead, she released her hold on the swords and sat in thought."
0,"“If you became a Grandmatriarch, would the Melians listen?"
0,Do you have to finish the pilgrimage to become a Grandmatriarch?”
0,Ceils eyes grew wide.
0,"She posed the question to the hamadryad and village matriarch, and the latter answered."
0,"“Before the Amelian Empire and the unification of Dhuillir, various tribes had their own Grandmatriarchs, born and rooted in their home tribe."
0,It was a time of war and strife between dryads.
0,The rule that a hamadryad must be killed if she cannot visit all the states of Dhuillir prevents such a division.
0,"By unifying all tribes under the same hamadryad, no conflict between tribes is possible.”"
0,"“If the hamadryad roots herself right now, who would obey her,” Sammy asked."
0,"“Only those who have accepted me,” the Hamadryad replied, “but even among them, there will be many who will change their hearts and reject me because I have not completed my pilgrimage."
0,Some remember tales of the great wars and may see my existence as a threat.”
0,Sammy stood and stared at the hamadryad with conviction in her eyes.
0,"“The Sprite Arkhon wants Justin to survive, and you said that you must obey the Arkhon."
0,You have your answer.”
0,Ceil’s body quivered with anticipation after translating Sammy’s declaration.
0,She watched as Sammy and the hamadryad stared at each other.
0,"The other dryads were silent, and the tension in the wide room of the hollow in the stout tree was palpable."
0,"In the silent standoff of wills, the hamadryad moved first."
0,She painfully tore off her other hand and leg from the palanquin and dangled her leg off the side.
0,"“Lady Ceil, when this war is over, promise that you will kill me,” the Hamadryad said."
0,"When the hamadryad shifted her body to the edge, the guard raised her spear and aimed for the hamadryad’s back."
0,"An arrow from Lemi’s bow hit the guard’s arm just above the elbow, and her elbow quickly swelled and burst, severing her arm and dropping the spear."
0,"Before the guard could fashion another weapon or reach for the hamadryad, Sammy had an orb of water ready and threw it at the guard."
0,The force of the burst knocked the guard to her back.
0,“Run!” Lemi cried.
0,"When the Hamadryad slid off the palanquin, Lemi immediately pulled both Sammy and Ceil out of the tree’s hollow with Jenae stumbling close behind."

“The Division of the Masses”"
1,“Coby! Help!”
0,"Chloe stumbled through the forest, fleeing for her life."
0,"When she attacked the soldiers chasing Coby, she was stunned frozen by the power of her own attack."
0,She watched the field burn as if hypnotized by the dancing flames.
0,"She did not think to move from her position, and before she realized, ten soldiers and two elves were bearing down on her."
0,"An arrow to her left arm woke her from her trance, and she fled fueled by her fear and the deshalu grass lingering in her system."
0,She held her arm tight just above the arrow to try and slow the bleeding.
0,"The pain was unbearable, and she could not spare even a moment to remove the arrow and sear the wound, not with the arrows and spikes of ice whizzing past her head and impacting the trees she weaved through."
0,"Ceil’s plan was for Chloe to immediately fall back to their original position on the other side of the village, but in her frantic sprint she was moving further and further away from the village."
0,"The orange glows of the flames were still visible, but the subdued blue glow of the tree in the center of the village was not."
0,"The further she fled, the further she was from help, so she risked changing course ninety degrees to bring her closer to the village."
0,The two Forest Elves quickly reacted to the shift in their target’s direction and bounded in a straight line to intercept.
0,Their agile legs built for the hunt propelled them forward over the uneven forest floor.
0,"Chloe could hear their feet approaching beside her, and the first elf was soon upon her."
0,"He grabbed her arm to restrain her but immediately released his grip with a hiss, shaking his hand."
0,"Chloe continued fleeing, but the elf did not give up."
0,His next attempt was to grab her binding to avoid her skin.
0,"When he gripped the bow on her back, Chloe dropped her center of gravity, turned, locked her arm under his and with a twist of her shoulders, he curled over his arm onto his back."
0,"The man expected to be finished off, but Chloe fled."
0,"The second Forest Elf passed the first, and his downed partner shouted something in a language that did not sound like the Elven that Eydis spoke."
0,He caught Chloe swiftly with one arm across her chest over her binding and the other gripping her pants at her hip and attempted to pull her to the ground.
0,"Chloe grabbed his wrists at her waist and across her chest, and with a slight shift of her hips and her left foot planted forward, her posture locked."
0,Chloe felt a surge of energy flow to her hand and into the man.
0,His posture buckled and he was on his back with Chloe still holding one wrist.
0,"The elf, far older than the first, looked up at her with shock as Chloe released him and ran towards the village."
1,"The blue glow at the center of the village was again in sight, driving Chloe faster."
0,"If she could at least reach the clearing, she could use her magic to defend herself instead of relying solely on the self-defense skills taught her by Eydis, but the village felt impossibly far away."
0,"The effects of the deshalu grass were ebbing, and Chloe could feel her feet growing heavier."
0,"An ice spike grazed her cheek, but the sharp tip melted on contact with her hot skin making the impact feel like she was pelted with a large rock."
0,"The soldiers gained a lot of ground due to the two elves who caught her, and those two elves were once again gaining fast."
0,Chloe pushed her legs faster.
0,"Far in the distance, the clearing was visible through the trees."
0,"The elves caught up but instead of trying to capture her as before, they kept their distance on each side, running between the trees."
0,"Chloe could only think that they were going to close off her path of escape to prevent her from reaching the clearing, but to her surprise, they only kept pace."
0,"The elder of the two shouted something at her that was distinctly Elven, but Chloe could not understand."
0,"She deeply wished she could tell them that she was not their enemy even though she attacked their village, but they would never believe her."
0,“Coby!”
0,"Chloe cried in desperation for the only other member of her group who was not meeting with the hamadryad, but she questioned how Coby could find her in the middle of a dense forest at night."
0,Chloe’s exhaustion was peaking.
0,"She slowed for only a single breath, and an arrow hit her back."
0,"Her lungs felt like they burst into flames, and her hope of rescue burned up with them."
0,She collapsed onto the forest floor with the village clearing only twenty yards ahead of her.
0,"Immediately the two elves were on her, and Chloe knew her time had come."
0,"Chloe closed her eyes to accept her fate as the taste of blood filled her mouth with each painful breath, but instead of a swift end, her wrists were seized, and she was pulled towards the village."
0,She opened her eyes to see the two elves dragging her with haste into the clearing.
0,The younger of the two moaned in agony from the heat of her touch.
0,Chloe could feel the skin of their hands blistering on her wrists.
0,A quick end would not come for her.
0,She knew she would pay for each life she extinguished.
0,"She tried to cry out Coby’s name, but all that left her mouth was a blood-filled cough."

“They caught her! Hurry!”"
0,Byurk urged his men forward.
0,"That woman was quick on her feet, as fast as his men if not faster."
0,She was clearly conditioned in hit-and-run tactics.
0,He was grateful for the two spriggans who came to his aid.
0,"If not for them, his ranger would not have been able to line up a shot, and she may have gotten away or worse, attacked again."
0,"Even injured, she was still dangerous, so he needed to catch up and finish her before she could harm anyone else."
0,"When Byurk and his men entered the clearing, he saw the two spriggans holding her wrists in pain."
0,"This woman had the rare ability to superheat her body without harming herself, a flameskin."
0,"The longer they held her, the more the spriggans would be injured, but if they let go, she could retaliate."
0,“Hold her still!” 
0,"Byurk lifted his foot to stomp down and shoot a spike up under her, but the ground shook, knocking him off balance."
0,"The phosphorescent light from the large stout tree in the center of the village faded, and the tree withered."
0,Byurk knew now that he had been terribly mistaken.
0,"He thought that the wife was here to retrieve her companion, but she had come for the hamadryad."
0,The wilting of the village matriarch’s tree was a terrible omen.
0,"If the wife was willing to attack a dryad village, was she even willing to kill the hamadryad to prevent the unified dryads from aiding Tolmyur?"
0,"That level of cruelty was indefensible, even in war."
0,The widow of the emperor was sabotaging her own subjects’ future.
0,Byurk questioned running to the hamadryad’s aid.
0,"The ground shook, and the huts near the matriarch’s tree collapsed."
0,"Should he protect the union between the dryads and Tolmyur to fight the invasion, or should he kill what invaders he could now?"
0,"The ground shook again, and Byurk made his decision."
0,“Kill that woman!
0,I will protect the hamadryad!” 
1,"Byurk sprinted towards the village, earth magic boosting each step."
0,"Around the clearing, dryads who had fled into the forest during the initial attack were reappearing and heading towards the village with haste."
0,Only now that their matriarch and hamadryad were in danger did they find the will to fight back?
0,Byurk forced the criticism from his mind and entered the village.
0,The few dryads who had not fled the village stood motionless staring at the withered tree.
0,"Roots slithered across the ground, and with each step, the tiny roots attempted to latch onto his feet."
0,"As he neared the tree, the roots grew large and thick, destroying the huts as they spread, but they no longer grasped at Byurk."
0,"Above his head, Byurk saw the Habha fly south towards where his men were executing the otherworlder."
0,Hopefully they killed her already and could focus on the new threat unabated.
0,He wished his men well in his mind and continued through the maze of roots as thick as he towards the center of the village.
0,"The matriarch’s tree grew brittle, and branches snapped and fell."
0,"In their place, large boughs of cedar broke through the dead wood."
0,"In the wide opening of the hollow of the tree, he saw the form of a beautiful woman."
0,"Her single leg fused to the roots spreading out in all directions, and from her arms clasped high above her head grew branches that pierced the ceiling."
0,"Before Byurk’s eyes, the connection from the roots at her feet to the branches above her head grew thicker into the trunk of a tree."
0,"Her back pressed against it as if bound by chains and hanging, but there was no displeasure in her full lips and downward gaze."
0,"“My apologies, young commander."
0,I have made my decision.” 
0,Her voice no longer grated like sand but carried the beauty of a melody.
0,"The wheel of time had reversed its course and returned the aged woman her youth, a resurrection and beginning of the next stage of a dryad’s life."
0,Byurk looked around at the room and saw the withered bodies of the village matriarch and the hamadryad’s guard crushed and mangled between the roots.
0,"No one else was present, not even Jenae who was to inform Tyree of the matriarch’s decision."
0,"“And what was your decision,” Byurk asked with fear pricking the back of his neck."
0,"“One far elder to me with greater authority than I has sided with those from the other world, and I must obey."
0,"I express my gratitude that you were willing to build positive relations with the dryads, and for that I will spare you against the will of Lady Ceil, but I must order you to leave this land."
0,You are no longer welcome here.
0,I have ordered my children to retrieve the man you hold prisoner.
0,Abandon him or face the wrath of Melia.”
0,"Despite his fear, anger boiled within Byurk’s stomach."
0,“The Amelian Empire has fallen!
0,The widow has no authority!
0,She has expressed open hostility to the dryads!
0,How can you choose to obey her over the looming threat of these invaders?!”
0,"The hamadryad shook her head, and the air of apology graced her perfect face."
0,“I do not know whether these humans from Earth are a danger to Whinhlem.
0,Lady Ceil’s authority is not what swayed me but the conviction of those from Earth and the will of the Lord of the Sprites.
0,I will die in atonement for my decision when this war is over.”
0,"Not wanting to hear more, Byurk ran out of the hollow."
0,"He lost the hamadryad’s support, so his only choice now was to kill the invading humans here in the village if at all possible."
1,"* * *
Tyree glared down at her elder sister who lay prostrate on the ground in a fit of apology."
0,“How could you let this happen?
0,Was Lady Ceil’s goal not the unification of Dhuillir?
0,How could you let her convince that hamadryad to divide our people?
0,I can no longer feel her.
0,How many Melians like me are not united under her?
0,How many of the tribes of Dhuillir do not even know her?”
0,"Through the grass, Tyree felt the approach of small feet from the village."
0,"Byurk hid behind a smoldering hut, and Tyree could feel his ven searching the ground for the location of Ceil’s companion."
0,She sent a root through the ground to grab his leg and pull him across the grass to her.
0,“I told you that you cannot kill him so long as he is under my protection. However…”
0,"Melians approached from the village and forest clearing, avoiding the burning ground."
0,"“The Grandmatriarch demands he be returned,” one of them called to Tyree."
0,"“That is not our Grandmatriarch,” Tyree shouted."
0,“That is a rot in our land that threatens to divide not just the Melians but all of Dhuillir.” 
0,She pulled Byurk to his feet and presented him before the crowd.
0,"“Tolmyur has sought to unify Dhuillir against a common enemy, the same enemy that has destroyed your village and stole that chance of unity from us for perhaps another thousand years or more.”"
0,"All around her, Tyree could see the hearts of many of the Melians changing, their conviction weakening in their expressions."
0,“Even now you can feel the division between us.
0,This hamadryad will send your daughters against their sisters.
0,"She is a poison that threatens to pull Dhuillir into another era of civil war, and this village needs to unite to kill her before that division spreads outside of Melia.”"
0,Byurk watched the crowd rally under the words of Tyree.
0,"She spoke in the Melian language, so he could not understand the meaning, but what he knew was that they no longer approached with the intent to retrieve the otherworlder as the hamadryad had commanded."
0,"There was a division growing among the Melians, and although the division might help his cause, he feared where it might lead."
0,He wanted to spare the Melians from conflict.
0,"The widow of the emperor not only brought conflict to them, but she also created conflict between them."
0,War was unavoidable.
0,"His only hope was to end it as quickly as possible, or perhaps he could direct it away from Melia."
0,"“I do not know your tongue, but I know the hearts of people."
0,"I can see the conflict that the hamadryad has caused, and I do not desire that any Melian be forced to raise her hand against her own."
0,The hamadryad has told me that she will atone for her decision with her death at the end of the war.
0,The quickest route to unity is to end the war and have the hamadryad obey her word.
0,I have discovered the means for a Grandmatriarch candidate to safely pilgrimage without trial or pain.
0,I promise that Tolmyur will guide the next candidate through her pilgrimage and unite Dhuillir.
0,The widow of Emperor Yuro is in your village.
0,Find her so that we may discuss the ending of this war.
0,Tell the other Melians in the village!”

Ceil, Sammy, and Lemi stood at the edge of the village and watched as cedar boughs broke through and continued to grow out of the stout tree."
0,"The conical tip of a cedar slowly rose from the top, towering into the dark sky."
0,"“I thought she was almost dead,” Ceil said in awe."
0,"“Hamadryads have to struggle constantly to keep their roots from growing, but once they let them grow, they drain all life near them and grow quickly."
0,Sometimes dryads get caught and become life for the hamadryad.
0,"It is viewed as an honor, but I could not let you be trapped like that,” Lemi explained."
0,“Is Justin going to be okay now?” 
0,Sammy’s anxiety never diminished even after convincing the hamadryad to side with them.
0,"“I cannot say,” Ceil replied honestly."
0,“What do you mean you cannot say!?”
0,"“I do not know where Jenae went, but she probably ran back to tell Tyree that the hamadryad sided with us.”"
0,Sammy grabbed Lemi’s arm.
0,“Why didn’t we follow Jenae!?”
0,"Lemi shrunk away from Sammy, so Ceil pushed her away from the cowering girl."
0,“She ran another direction when we fled.
0,You saw how quickly those roots were growing.
0,"If we turned back, we would have been caught in it."
0,We should return to our meeting spot.”
0,"“What about Justin,” Sammy shrieked, well past her breaking point."
0,Ceil took a breath to prevent herself from shouting back.
0,"She understood Sammy’s worry and anger, and any retaliation would set Sammy off worse than before."
0,"“Sammy, the reason you convinced the hamadryad to take root here was so that she could command the dryads to retrieve him for us."
0,Trust that she will obey her word.”
0,Sammy nodded reluctantly. “Okay.”
1,"Ceil held Sammy’s wrist and pulled her south towards their agreed meeting spot where she hoped Chloe was waiting, but as they neared the southwest side of the village, she saw Coby frantically attacking from the air."
0,“Coby!”
0,"When Coby heard Ceil, he cried back, but did not turn from his assault."
0,"Ceil and Lemi broke into a sprint, leaving Sammy trailing behind."
0,Ceil saw Coby and one Forest Elf fighting ten soldiers.
0,"A younger, injured Forest Elf huddled on the ground shielding Chloe."
0,Chloe was immobile and two arrows protruded from her back and arm.
0,Ceil’s heart raced.
0,"When she gave Chloe her orders, she thought that Chloe would be able to attack and then flee in the panic her attack would inevitably cause, but watching how easily the soldiers were perfectly avoiding both Coby and the Forest Elf’s wind attacks while simultaneously counterattacking, she knew these were not average infantry."
0,"Even after an attack as powerful as the explosion she saw, there would be some who could avoid the damage and retaliate immediately."
0,"Lemi nocked an arrow and fired, but her target cut the arrow down with his sword."
0,"Ceil and Lemi’s existence known, a few soldiers changed their target."
0,"An archer fired an arrow back at Lemi, and instead of dodging it, Lemi blocked it with her forearm."
0,"The arrow penetrated through, but she tore it out without any show of pain, nocked it in her own bow, and fired it back."
0,The torn wound on her arm slowly repaired itself.
0,"Coby aimed at the distracted soldiers, but in the open field, they anticipated the trajectory of the wind blade and sidestepped away."
0,"“That must be the wife,” one of the soldiers called, and they all changed their target from Chloe to Ceil."
0,"A swordsman charged at Ceil, and Ceil realized that her staff was still inside the matriarch’s tree."
0,"Without a conduit, she was limited in what magic she could use."
0,Life was her only element and it only worked by contact.
0,"She reached down and used the roots in the grass to bind the charging soldiers’ feet, but the roots alone were too weak."
0,"He stumbled, but each step tore the roots away."
0,She was not powerful enough to bind him with such thin roots.
0,"She needed a tree or at least her staff, but with no other option, she tried again."
0,"The swordsman stumbled, and when he was about to regain his footing, he froze."
0,"Lines of black crept up his face, and his skin sagged."
0,Lemi landed an arrow in his chest.
0,"Like the arrow that hit the hamadryad’s guard, the impact site ruptured in a spray of blood, killing him instantly, but the blood was blackened, no longer its natural crimson hue."
0,The grass between her and the downed soldier wilted black and flaked into powder.
0,"Ceil shuddered but pushed onward, searching for her next target."
1,"A thin wall of ice grew, dividing the soldiers from their targets."
0,The frozen trail originated from the village where two High Elves knelt with their hands on the ground.
0,Four dryads ran past them.
0,"“Commander Byurk demands a ceasefire,” one of the dryads called out."
0,“He wishes to speak with Lady Ceil.”
0,"The soldiers, visible through the thin wall of ice, stepped back and lowered their weapons."
0,Ceil ran towards Chloe.
0,The Forest Elf covering her had a deep gash across his back and left arm and was bleeding out quickly.
0,She pulled him off to inspect Chloe and saw that the Forest Elf was terribly burnt where he held her.
0,"Chloe’s clothes were smoldering and falling off her, and the arrows in her back and arm were black and smoking."
0,“Lemi! Hurry!
0,We need a healer!”
0,"Ceil tried placing her hand on Chloe to check if she was alive, but her fingers stung the moment they touched Chloe’s skin."
0,"Lemi was about to do the same, so Ceil pulled her hand back."
0,“Do not touch her.

0,Burns were the only form of damage incurable for dryads.
0,"If the Dryads cannot touch Chloe, how can we heal her?"
0,"“Move,” Sammy ordered, pushing Ceil aside."
0,“She’s overheating.” 
0,"She conjured a large sphere of water and dropped it on Chloe, sending an explosion of steam in all directions."
0,"“Has this happened before,” Ceil asked, shielding her face from the near-scalding mist."
0,"Sammy dropped a second and third sphere, but Chloe would not cool."
0,“Damn it.
0,We need ice magic.”
0,"“Lemi, bring those High Elves here quickly!"
0,And a shaman!” Ceil ordered.
0,Lemi ran towards the village while Sammy continued dropping water.
0,"“Lady Ceil, I apologize for our inability to protect her,” the elder Forest Elf said, kneeling and bowing his head."
0,“We were unaware she worked for you until she used the royal arts.
0,"By then, we were too late."
0,"Although the scale cannot be balanced, please accept my son’s sacrifice as compensation.”"
0,"“Chloe is not dead yet and neither is your son,” Ceil replied."
0,“There is nothing to balance.”
0,“The High Elves!” Lemi returned with the two High Elves who created the ice wall.
0,“I need you to cool her down.
0,"Use ice magic directly,” Ceil ordered."
0,"“But that will harm her,” the High Elf warned."
0,“It will not.
0,Stop when there is no more steam.
0,"Lemi, what about the shaman?”"
0,"“None of the dryads there were shamans,” Lemi said worriedly."
0,“Then you need to heal them.
0,Start with the Forest Elf and then move to Chloe when she cools.”
0,Ceil sat back as Lemi tended to the large gash on the Forest Elf while the two High Elves tried to coat Chloe with frost only to have steam blow back in their faces with incredible force.
0,"The soldiers on the other side of the ice wall scoffed and jeered at the failed attempts to heal Chloe, and Ceil fought within herself not to order those near her to silence them."
0,"When Ceil felt she was about to snap, Coby landed atop the wall and knocked a few of the unprepared soldiers to their backs with a single flap of his large wings."
0,Coby’s cry of triumph was met with the drawing of swords.
1,“Stand down!”
0,A crowd of dryads approached from the east side of the village.
0,"A minum led them, the commander of the soldiers."
0,"Tyree walked beside him, her hand on a stretcher carried by two young dryads."
0,“Justin!” Sammy jumped to her feet and pressed her hands against the ice wall.
0,"Although the scene was distorted through the clear ice, she knew it was him."
0,There could be no other.
0,Ceil stood next to Sammy and placed her hand on her shoulder.
0,Together they watched the approaching parade as anxiety wracked Ceil’s mind.
0,"The hamadryad chose to side with her, but the demand for ceasefire and the Tolmyur commander leading the procession felt to Ceil like he held the dryads’ favor, not the hamadryad."
0,The soldiers parted as the commander approached.
0,"He stood on the other side of the wall, and although he was half Ceil’s height, she felt so small in front of him."
0,"On her side of the wall were a few elves and only a handful of dryads, but over half the entire village stood behind him."
0,The commander stepped forward and spoke.
0,"“Ceil, widow of late Emperor Yuro of Amel, I am here to discuss the ending of this war, but first I must express my utter disgust of your actions here in Melia.”"

0,She found a village and built positive relations with them amid gross misunderstandings.
0,"The dryads were subjects of the Amelian Empire, so relying on their aid was nothing to warrant disgust."
0,"If there was anything that Ceil felt disgust over, it was her ignorance of Justin’s role in whatever was to come that led her to abandon him."
0,"She traveled as quick as possible to recover him, and when they located him in this village, she was careful to only target the Tolmyur soldiers, enemies of all the Amelian Empire, including the dryads."
0,"She was eliminating the enemies of the dryads, and that was nothing to warrant disgust, especially in a war."
0,"With Sammy’s help, she convinced the hamadryad to take her side so that she could recover Justin."
0,"Part of the village was destroyed, but the huts could be regrown quickly, and now the dryads had a Grandmatriarch when the hamadryad would not have been able to complete the pilgrimage."
0,These were victories.
0,"“If I have done anything to warrant the disgust of a commander of Tolmyur, it is because I have overpowered you."
0,"My actions here have been a benefit to Melia and all Dhuillir,” Ceil announced to the enemy commander."
0,"“I find it troubling that you can spew such filth in front of every Melian before you,” Byurk replied."
0,“Or are you so ignorant that you believe your actions righteous?”
0,"Tyree scowled, causing Ceil’s heart to sink, and Ceil began to doubt what she had accomplished."
0,"The displeased faces of the crowd were deafening in their silence, and Ceil could barely maintain her composure."
0,What did I do?
0,"“As a ruler of the Amelian Empire, you cannot be so ignorant of Dhuillir politics and history."
0,"You knew full well that by forcing the hamadryad to take root before completing her pilgrimage you would divide the states of Dhuillir into two conflicting factions, those who are connected to the hamadryad and will support you and those who have surrendered to Tolmyur and have no connection to the hamadryad."
0,Even among those who have accepted the hamadryad there is contention.
0,There are many like the Melians behind me who fear the civil conflict that such a division will inevitably cause.
0,You have brought war to a peaceful people who want nothing to do with the conflict between Tolmyur and elves.”
0,Ceil once again felt as if she was drowning in the murky depths of her heart.
0,"She grasped at the air above her, trying to pull herself out or stay afloat, but she found no hold."
0,Every slight movement sunk her deeper.
0,She brought war to Dhuillir.
0,"Ceil’s hand clasped that thought, and she straightaway pulled herself out of the murk."
0,Fire welled in her chest from the destruction she had seen at the hands of the Tolmyur Kingdom.
0,“I brought war?
0,I brought war to the Amelian Empire?!
0,"If you want to speak of division, who was it that killed the three Grandmatriarchs of Dhuillir?"
0,Who was it that first destroyed that unity?
0,Are the dryads worse off now that they have partial unity than when they had none?
0,Tolmyur is the one who attacked us and assassinated the royal family.
0,You are the enemy that killed the leaders of all the sovereign states of the empire.
0,"You brought war to our peaceful nation, not I!”"
0,“Your nation only obtained that peace at our expense.
0,"I cannot speak for the orders of my Commanding General that brought war and destroyed your oppressive empire, but I can testify that we have no ill will against the dryads."
0,"Commanding General Jethro has made an alliance with the most ancient dryad race, the kissiae, and Dhuillir has remained mostly untouched in this conflict."
0,"Before you bring war to their forests and force mother to fight against daughter and sister against sister, I demand an end to this conflict."
0,Surrender yourself and show that you do care for your former subjects.”
0,"“If you care for the dryads, you can end this war by leaving the Amelian Empire and returning to your homeland.” "
0,“You are mistaken.
0,"Tolmyur has no ill will against the dryads, but we cannot let the crimes of your people go unpunished.”"
0,"“After hearing that, do you think I will simply surrender myself to you?"
0,Your accusations are nothing more than you choking on the very air you breathe.”
0,“What then is your plan?
0,Will you force the dryads to die for you so that you might take back your throne?
0,How do you plan on compensating them for the lives lost?
0,Or do you plan on abusing your authority by demanding their sacrifice?”
0,Ceil watched the gazes of the dryads through the thinning ice.
0,Her chest felt as if it was being sucked inward.
0,"The hamadryad told her all the dryads would not be connected, but Ceil could never admit that she was ignorant of the dangers that a hamadryad taking root before completing her pilgrimage could cause to the stability of Dhuillir, that it would divide them."
0,I do not want anyone else to die because of me.
0,“I did not convince the hamadryad to force Dhuillir to fight for me.
0,"I needed her help to rescue my companion, the injured man in Tyree’s care."
0,I had no other goal.”
0,"A smile grew on the commander’s face, and Ceil realized she had fallen prey to a cleverly hidden trap."
0,Her stunned visage only widened the commander’s smile.
0,"“I suppose you would not be willing to make a trade, your life for the otherworlder’s?”"
0,"Ceil remained silent, unsure how to respond without falling deeper into the minum’s plot."
0,“I assumed not.
0,"If what you said is true, I have a proposal."
0,"I do not desire war to come to the peaceful land of Dhuillir, a feeling I realize now that you also share."
0,I challenge you to battle in Vallen.
0,The fairies are in active opposition against us and challenge our successful defeat of the Amelian Empire.”
0,Color drained from Ceil’s face.
0,“You only attacked the fairies because they protected me!”
0,"“Be that as it may, the conflict has grown beyond whether you were hidden there or not."
0,"Because you were the cause of their fall, join them in their fight for survival."
0,"If you defeat us, you have shown your right to rule."
0,"If you fall, then your death will bring an end to this conflict."
0,"Meet me in battle, and I will return your companion in good health."
0,"If your otherworld invaders are as strong as I have seen, you may have a chance."
0,"If you flee or take too long and the conflict in Vallen ends, then the life of your companion is forfeit, and I do not doubt my Commanding General will make certain that destruction follows you wherever you flee until the end of your days.”"
0,"Lemi touched Ceil’s shoulder, startling her."
0,"“Chloe is still really hot, but she has cooled enough for treatment.”"
0,Ceil looked behind her and saw Chloe laying on her stomach while an elderly dryad worked frantically to heal the arrow wound in her back.
0,"The number of dryads on Ceil’s side of the wall had increased, but she did not know if they were figuratively on her side or whether they also supported the Tolmyur commander."
0,She looked at Sammy whose face was so close to the wall of ice that her worried breaths were melting a hole through the wall.
0,Justin remained as still as death on the other side.
0,Ceil wondered if she could somehow steal Justin away.
0,Sammy had suffered far too long because of him and even more because Ceil had abandoned him to capture.
0,"Coby understood the sprite language, so if she gave him the order, no one on the commander’s side would understand, but then she remembered what happened when Coby tried to carry Sammy away."
0,"Justin was heavier than her, or perhaps they were the same weight now with how malnourished Justin had become, but Coby could not lift him, and even if he could, well-trained soldiers could attack before he flew back up out of harm’s way."
0,His ascent would assuredly be slowed by Justin’s unnatural weight.
0,“Your answer?” Byurk pressed.
0,Ceil looked at her companions.
0,Could she carry them with her to war?
0,Deep down she wanted to abandon Justin.
0,Was he truly so important to be worth dividing Dhuillir and going to war?
0,Why did the Sprite Arkhon place him as her equal in the coming conflict?
0,What was the coming conflict?
0,Was the battle in Vallen only a part or was it an unimportant or disconnected precursor to what is to come?
0,Ceil felt trapped.
0,"No matter what decision she made, danger would follow, and people would die."
0,"She wanted to break down and cry out her anxiety, her fears, and her inadequacy."
0,All she could do was follow where this torrential river carried her.
0,"“If you can promise me that you will return my companion in full health, I accept."
0,I will meet you in battle in Vallen.”
0,“Then we are in agreement.” 
0,"The commander stomped his foot, and jagged earth shot up from beneath the wall, shattering it."
0,“Justin!” Sammy jumped over the broken ice and was only able to touch him before four soldiers grabbed her and pushed her back.
0,She fell into the jagged ice and watched with watery eyes as the soldiers retrieved the stretcher from the dryads and walked away.
0,Ceil watched Sammy remorsefully as she grasped the commander’s outstretch wrist to seal their agreement.
0,"A voice from the shadows of her heart told her to use her cursed magic to poison him, but he had an army of dryads on his side."
0,"Such action would only create conflict and potentially drown the village in battle once more, making her out to be the enemy of the dryads he claimed she was."
0,They did not need to clasp wrists to seal their agreement.
0,Ceil knew he was testing her conviction.
0,"When their hands parted, the commander turned his back without another word and followed after his soldiers."
1,"Epilogue
“The Unknown”
Sammy watched the soldiers disappear into the forest."
0,"The sharp ice dug into her back, but the pain was nothing compared to watching Justin be carried away again when she was close enough to touch him."
0,“Why?
0,What happened?
0,Why are they taking Justin away?
0,Didn’t we come all this way to save him?” Sammy looked up at Ceil who could only stare silently with a guilty countenance.
0,“Why did you let him go?” Sammy stood and confronted Ceil.
0,“Why did you let him go?!”
0," She pushed Ceil with all her weight, and Ceil staggered back, nearly falling to the ground."
0,“Chloe nearly died!
0,You destroyed this village!
0,And then you just let Justin go?!”
0,“I had no choice…” Ceil said apologetically.
0,"“You always have a--” Sammy cut herself off and screamed into the air in anger, frustration, and sorrow."
0,Ceil knelt and bowed her forehead to the ground.
0,"The elves, nymphs, and dryads who saw gasped in shock that the Empress of the Amelian Empire would bow before another."
0,“Please understand.
0,"There was nothing I could do,” Ceil said, fighting to hold in her own spiraling emotions."
0,“I don’t want to hear it!” 
0,Sammy stomped off away from the crowd towards the forest.
0,"Coby trotted behind her, but she pushed him away."
0,“I need to be alone.” 
0,He cried in protest but did not follow.
1,"Sammy wandered until she found a small, secluded trench through the forest floor."
0,She sat down in it with her knees tucked to her chest and cried into her arms.
0,"She had always regretted breaking up with Justin, and she could not deny feeling jealous every time he and Eydis were affectionate with each other."
0,She wanted to turn back time and apologize for treating him poorly to make her feel better about her decision.
0,"From the moment he took that bullet for her, she wanted to set everything right."
0,"She still loved him, and she mourned every second she saw him suffering."
0,"Every morning, she woke with the fear that Justin had passed in the night."
0,She was so close to getting him back but then had to watch as he was carried away again.
0,"Some deal was struck between Ceil and the soldiers, a deal without her input and one she could not understand."
0,"Ceil abandoned him while Sammy sat and watched, ignorant of what was going on around her."
0,“Why am I so useless…?”
0,Sammy dug her fingers into the moist soil and squeezed it in her hand.
0,“Why can’t I do anything?!”
0,She tossed the dirt at the embankment of the trench across from her in a fit of rage and self-loathing.
0,Wad of dirt after wad of dirt peppered the embankment until Sammy’s fingernails stung and bled.
0,"She hunched over and placed her face in the dirt, crying out her agony."
0,A warm wind enveloped Sammy like a blanket.
0,The dirt and dead leaves beneath her grew into a soft patch of grass with budding yellow flowers.
0,"Moss and red clover covered the embankment of the trench, and the sweet aroma filled her nose."
0,Sammy looked around and saw petals falling from nowhere as if appearing from the air.
0,"Tears streamed from her eyes, and she choked as she tried to speak."
0,"“I’m sorry, Arkhon."
0,I couldn’t keep my promise.
0,I couldn’t save Justin… You were right.”
0,“I disagree.” 
0,"The Arkhon’s smooth tenor voice, appearing as if he sat in front of her, held the tone of a loving father comforting his crying daughter."
0,“You upheld your promise splendidly.
0,Justin found the aid he needed and is now in fair health.
0,His strength will recover in time.”
0,“But I lost him.
0,The soldiers took him away.”
0,“That was never part of our challenge.” 
0,“I don’t care about the challenge!
0,I just want Justin to be here with me…” 
0,"Sammy tried to hold back her sobs, but they broke through in hiccups and coughs."
0,"She wiped her nose and cheeks, only serving to smear dirt across her face."
0,"“My, you are a noisy one."
0,"Because you could not understand the agreement between Ceil and Byurk, I am pleased to inform you that Justin will be returned to you in Vallen, the land of the fairies."
0,Ceil agreed to meet him there to spare the dryads further conflict.”
0,"The Arkhon chuckled heartedly, catching Sammy off guard."
0,She looked forward into the empty air in front of her where the voice emanated.
0,“We sprites have something you might call a collective foresight.
0,Together we can predict future events with a fair level of accuracy.
0,I must say that you surprised us.
0,"The dryads were never supposed to be part of the coming battles in Amel, but you not only single handedly pulled them into it, you set them against each other."
0,None of us saw that coming!” 
0,The Arkhon laughed again.
0,Sammy stared blankly in front of her.
0,She felt like her heart stopped beating.
0,"She couldn’t understand how any of her actions could have caused an entire nation to join the war, let alone split on opposing sides."
0,“Didn’t you say that Ceil and those soldiers agreed to leave for the land of the fairies so that the dryads don’t get involved?”
0,“Do you really expect two sides in a war to not use every tool at their disposal?
0,"I had my doubts when you said that you would place your mark on the conflict, but you may be right.”"
0,“This is not what I meant!”
0,"“Well, the ripple is small, but you have proved me wrong."
0,"You have reminded us that the sprites are not omniscient, a reminder that many of us desperately needed, I’ll have you know."
0,"As per our agreement, I will reward you.”"
0,“I don’t want to be rewarded for this!” Sammy shouted.
0,“Come now.”
0,The light warm breeze circled Sammy’s head as did the Arkhon’s voice.
0,"“I am not giving you anything extraordinary, only something minor, and equal to your meager contribution."
0,Think of it as bringing you closer to your goal of standing with your friends.”
0,Sammy looked down at her dirt-encrusted and lightly bleeding fingers.
0,"She wanted to be strong like Chloe, commanding like Ceil, and caring like Justin."
0,"She felt minuscule compared to them, especially knowing that they were so important that sprites in Whinhlem knew and recognized them despite Chloe and Justin being from Earth."
0,"“Of everything you have experienced since arriving here in Whinhlem, what is it that you regret most, besides Justin being carried away, of course.”"
0,“You can’t return Justin to me?
0,"You can use spatial magic, right?”"
0,"“Yes, I could, rather easily in fact, but I am curious where your ripple will lead."
0,I do not want to agitate the water now.
0,"Something else, if you will.”"
0,“Wait…” Sammy looked around her.
0,She felt the soft grass that had grown so suddenly.
0,She smelled the sweet aroma of the clover.
0,“You can use life magic?”
0,“Of course.
0,How else do you think we prevented Justin from dying until you found help?”
0,"“Don’t tell me… You had the ability to heal Justin all along, didn’t you?” "
0,“Our original plan was to surprise you all with Justin in top shape before you left Ceil’s little garden.
0,"I was looking forward to the joyous reunion, but your bet with me sounded far more intriguing.”"
0,Sammy grasped at the voice by her left ear and felt the warm wind sift through her fingers.
0,“You could have healed Justin but instead you let him suffer?!”
0,“Who am I to deprive you of your determination?”
0,“Don’t you dare shift the blame to me!” 
0,"Sammy conjured an orb of water and threw it at the most recent direction of the voice, but it flew unobstructed until it hit the embankment of the trench."
0,“You should have told me you were planning to heal him!”
0,The warm air brushed across Sammy’s right cheek.
0,"“To be honest, our job is to observe and maintain."
0,Gyea would be furious if she knew we were directly interfering.
0,"Plus, the more we personally interfere, the more inaccurate our foresight becomes."
0,Your decision to find help for Justin was beneficial to us in that regard.
0,Justin is healthy and he will be returned to you.
0,"That much I can promise, so please calm down.”"
0,“You expect me to calm down?!”
0,“Need help?”
0,"Sammy felt a tiny hand touch her forehead, and she blacked out."
1,"Sammy’s body fell limp to the side, but the Arkhon swept her up in a gentle breeze to lay her down gently on the soft moss of the embankment."
0,"The sprites were not omniscient, but through the combined observations of many sprites across countless worlds and the detailed visions of probability inherent to their being, they could calculate with almost certainty how the future would unfold."
0,"Very minor alterations of distant future predictions were not unheard of, but short-term predictions were always completely accurate."
0,"And yet, this woman was not only invisible to their foresight, but her actions also never played into their predictions."
0,“Peculiar. Perhaps I should expect much from you.”
0,The Arkhon brushed away the dirt and tears from Sammy’s face.
0,He cleaned the dirt from her hands and healed her split fingernails.
0,She had such passion that he could not help but feel moved.
0,"For the first time in an age, the Arkhon felt guilt that his curiosity had caused someone’s suffering."
0,“Those with the most passion are the easiest to understand.
0,"When you are here before me, I know what you think."
0,"I know what you will say or do, but the moment you leave my sight, you become invisible to me."
0,I can only see through the actions of those around you.”
0,The Arkhon brushed Sammy’s bangs and watched as she gasped in weak and troubled breaths.
0,His eyes fell to the black mark on Sammy’s neck that even now continued to spread at a rate nearly unnoticeable to a mortal eye.
0,"That corrupted mark would try and weaken her again, and the longer it remained, the more powerful it would grow as it fed on Sammy’s soul."
0,The curse seemed awfully similar to the malady affecting Bydrofe.
0,He wiped his hand over the mark and extracted it like a dark mist from her neck.
0,"It pulsed angrily in the air, lashing out small tendrils to cling back onto Sammy and finding no interest in him."
0,He was not the curse’s target.
0,The Archon froze the curse in time and sent it back to Fiorrae to be researched along with the other corrupted plants that withered black and died as Ceil tended her forest garden home.
0,Sammy’s breath eased and grew peaceful in deep and comfortable slumber away from her troubles.
0,"“Peculiar, indeed."
0,"As for your deepest regret, perhaps I should give you the same gift I gave Jethro."
0,"Although, I did give him his for free due to the role he would play."
0,How about I make yours more… universal.
0,My treat.
0,"It is a paltry gift, but surely you will make great use of it.”"
1,"* * *
Byurk looked at his nine remaining men."
0,The attack by that fire mage singlehandedly eliminated most of his party.
0,The defenses of the earth mages were nothing against that strange flame that clung to the ground like oil.
0,Not even his fire mage could withstand the heat.
0,This was the power that would await them in Vallen when they met the wife in battle.
0,“Who of you is fit to send a message to the palace?” he asked his men.
0,“I am.” The sole remaining ranger stepped forward.
0,"“You were originally conscripted to be a scout, if I recall.”"
0,"“Yes sir, but they changed my position after seeing my skill with a bow.” "
0,“Well enough.
0,I need you to inform the generals at the palace of everything that has transpired here.
0,Inform them that we will be meeting the widow in battle at Vallen at their last remaining fairy cities.
0,"Most importantly, make certain you impress upon them the power we have witnessed in the humans from the other world."
0,All able units not required to hold the capital should march for Vallen.
0,We will need every able man if we are to win.
0,"If our Commanding General has returned from his campaign, inform him first.”"
0,The ranger tapped his fist to his chest.
0,“Yes sir.
0,"I will run with urgency, even if I die once my message is relayed.”"
1,"* * *
Ceil walked slowly through the village as the morning light broke through the horizon."
0,"She viewed the destruction of the village, the destruction she caused."
0,"The dryads had no material possessions, but the elfkind and nymphs near the center of the village were scavenging through the roots for their possessions buried in their collapsed huts."
0,Ceil could not look at them from the weight of guilt born by her ignorance.
0,"She had abused her authority, thinking that because she was the empress of a fallen empire that everything she did was permissible."
0,The hamadryad was correct.
0,Her empire was no more.
0,She was not an empress.
0,She was only a farm girl raised in a palace and who just happened to be the widow of the last emperor.
1,Ceil climbed over the roots in front of the matriarch’s tree and entered the hollow.
0,"“You look troubled, child.”"
0,Ceil could not look up at the hamadryad.
0,She did not reply.
0,"After all, what could she say?"
0,The hamadryad did not want to take root here.
0,She would have preferred to die rather than divide Dhuillir.
0,"Ceil searched the broken hollow, turning away from the mangled bodies of the matriarch and guard who failed to escape."
0,"In the back behind the hamadryad, she found what she was searching for."
0,Roots bound her staff.
0,She placed her hand on the brittle wood and found it dead.
0,All life that was once in it had become nourishment for the hamadryad.
0,"Now that the life was lost, it could not return."
0,She placed her hand on the roots and used life magic to uncoil them.
0,She headed for the exit with staff in hand.
0,"“Do not regret your decisions, Lady Ceil."
0,The true quality of a leader is not in always choosing the best course but in making the most out of both the good and the bad paths you have taken.”
0,“You only say this because you feel I have made the wrong choice.” 
1,"Ceil walked out into the village, cradling her dead staff to her chest like a doll."
0,She climbed over the roots and circled to the north side of the village that was far less damaged and entered the largest hut.
0,Jenae and Lemi sat side by side next to Chloe.
0,"Steam rose from her body in the humid morning air, but she was breathing peacefully."
0,“Has Sammy not returned?” Lemi asked with concern.
0,"“Coby was watching her from a distance, so I am sure she will be fine."
0,We should leave her alone for a while.” 
0,Ceil sat down on the other side of Chloe and caressed her staff.
0,"Lemi looked at the staff, and as a shaman, she could tell the conduit was dead."
0,“Are you going to grow a new one?”
0,“I am not as skilled as you in dryadic or healing magic.
0,This wood came from Fiorrae.
0,"I will have to use a branch of one of the trees here and nourish it for a while, but it will not be the same.”"
0,“Why not ask the hamadryad for a branch.
0,"Hers will probably be stronger,” Jenae suggested."
0,"“I would rather not,” Ceil said flatly."
0,"“I figured as much, so I asked her for you,” spoke a voice above them."
0,Ceil looked up and saw the Arkhon floating above her head.
0,"Lemi yelped, and Jenae stared with wide eyes."
0,A red cedar staff appeared from the air and dropped on Ceil’s head.
0,She caught it quickly before it fell onto Chloe and rubbed the sting on her head.
0,“Did that wake you up a bit?
0,Stop looking so glum.
0,I thought you promised me you would be alright after you left Fiorrae.”
0,Ceil ignored him and checked the life of the staff.
0,"The capacity was not as strong as the wood from Fiorrae, but it was not much weaker either."
0,"“You will find it far less malleable than your last staff, so think of it as a tool to train with.”"
0,Ceil gripped her new staff and felt the smooth wood that teemed with life.
0,There was a weight on her mind that she could only ask now with the Sprite Arkhon present.
0,“Why did you not tell me that Justin and Chloe were the same as me?”
0,“The same?” 
0,"“I mean, important in the war."
0,"You told Sammy, and I made a terrible mistake because I did not know.”"
0,The Arkhon landed on Ceil’s shoulder and patted her lightly on her cheek.
0,“Quite simple.
0,"If you felt obligated to trust them and work with them, then you would not have grown."
0,You came to your own conclusions on what to think and how to view Chloe and Justin.
0,And mistakes are an important part of growth.”
0,"“I feel sorry for Sammy, though.” "
0,“Because of Justin?” 
0,"“Of course that is part of it, but she tries so hard."
0,Is she not like them or me?”
0,"“To be honest, I do not know."
0,She might be a dark horse in all of this.”
0,Ceil looked at the Arkhon in confusion.
0,“What is a horse?”
0,The Arkhon patted Ceil on the nose and hopped into the air.
0,"“I have business elsewhere, so I must be leaving."
0,Take care of Sammy.
0,I am excited to see how she grows.”
0,"Sammy appeared suddenly on the floor beside Ceil, unconscious and weak-breathed."
0,“Sammy?
0,"What happened to her?” Ceil asked, worried."
0,“Nothing you need to worry about.
0,She just needs rest.
0,"I expect her to sleep for about a day and a half, maybe two."
0,Do not let any of the dryads touch her.
0,I do not want their inferior life magic to mess anything up.”
